Some years ago a contemporary
I philosophe
told us that there was nothing an Englishman
would not do nothing an American would not
say
I
nothing an Italian would not sing ; no
music to which the Frenchman would not dance
what
nothing the German would not covet ; ' and
nothing
U
Chinese would not eat
