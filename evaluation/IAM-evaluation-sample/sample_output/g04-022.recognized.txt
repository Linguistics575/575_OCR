After the
the first World War , 194 , I did not went
Germany for ten years , by which time in
1924 I was
different parish in Surrey
Towards the end of my five and a half years
incumbency I was asked if I would start
a village choral
society and conduct
This opened up a new interest , and we plunged
into it
