The presence of IS of bismuth-210 is equivalent to
ingrowth over two half-lives ( ten days ) . Therefore
after a further forty days , the bismuth daughter
will be within O.I sources are required for use sooner
than forty or fifty days after preparation , the
lead -210 together with added lead carrier must
be separated from the bismuth-210 daughter by
jon exchange ( see Analytical Method , steps u , s )
before precipitating lead chromate
