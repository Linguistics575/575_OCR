The film version of Min Shelagh Delaney's play a
Taste of Honey opens at the Leicester Square Theater
tomorrow . It has been produced and directed by
Mr. Tony Richardson , who is also part - author with
Man Delaney of the script , and the great advantages
to be derived from this unity of conception and control
are everywhere apparent
