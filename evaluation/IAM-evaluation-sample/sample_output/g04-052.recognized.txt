It was very interesting to have the privilege of Filling
such a beautiful building with suitable Fittings ; I made
a cule all gifts should be submitted for approval to
the architect , himself a Fine artist . It is quite possible
to put beautiful things into a beautiful church
and yet spoil the building with ornaments unsu
table to the envicons
