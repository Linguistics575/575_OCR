But there is heart in the telling , and an
intense realism in the situation . A young
girl lives in a single dingy room with her
slatternly , promiscuous mother . In such
surroundings she learns sex is something sordid ,
and wen the experiences it for the first time
herself it is incoherently , clumsily , but half
shyly and half inquisitively . As in the case in
Fanny her first lover is a sailor who leaves
her to bear his child and sails away
