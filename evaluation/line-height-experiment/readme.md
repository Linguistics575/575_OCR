## Line Height Experiment
This directory contains the files used to determine that line height, pencil vs. ink, and binarization each have an impact on Handwriting Recognition Performance.
### Procedure
I created dark lined papers with lines at 6mm, 7mm, 8mm, and 10mm apart, I held these behind a piece of white unlined paper, and I wrote out a sample paragraph from the Lindsley Foote Hall diaries in ink and in pencil using each of the varying line widths.  This allowed me to take full control over the line width.  

### Results
I found that as the line width went up, the WER went down.  I also found that pencil was harder to recognize than ink.  Sometimes, there was a small improvement from binarization.
