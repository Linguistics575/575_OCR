PREFACE. The present volume forms the second part of thc tor's Handb()ok for Egypt, the first part of which has reached a second edition in 1885. The materials upon which this Handbook to Upper Egypt is chiefly founded were contributed principally by Jhjessor Georg Ebers of Leipsic, and Professor Johannes J)ilmichen of Strassburg, and their work, wliich was mainly finished in 1877, has been revised, augmented, and brought up to datc in all j)ractical details by Profe3sor A.ugust Eisenlohr of Heidelberg, who has twice visIted Egypt for this express purpose. To Prof. Ebers the editor is indebted for the account of the Nile-voyage as far as and including Philre; Prof. michen contributed the descriptions of the temples of derah and Edfu. of the town of and of the routes thence via. the quarries of to on the Red Sea; while the routes in Lower Nubia and to the Western Oases are wholly from the :pen of Prof. Eisenlohr. The practical introductIOn to the first volume, and the sections on 
the geography, history, and art of Egypt, there published, apply of coufse also to the districts of Upper Egypt. The special introduction to the present volume deals chiefly with the Nile voyage and the necessary preparatiQns for it, preceded by a brief survey of the chief steamer-routes between Egypt and Europe and a note on the new Egyptian monetary system, introduced since the publication of the Handbook to Lower Egypt. A list of works on Egypt is added, and, to obviate the necessity of too fre!luent ferences to the first volume, also a chronological hst of the rulers of Egypt down to the close of the Ptolemaic period, and a selection from the royal cartouches of most frequent occurrence in Upper Egypt. Finally the Arabic Alphabet is given, showing the system of transliteration adopted in this Handbook. The MAPS and PI,ANS have been an object of especial care. The former are based upon the large maps of Kiepert, Lepsius, and Linant; the latter chiefly upon the plans of Lepsius, though with the necessary additions and corrections, wliile some have been specially prepared by Prof....Eisen}ohr.

vi PREFACE. HEIGHTS above the sea.-Ievel and other measurements are given in English feet or miles. Though nearly every page of the Handbook has been compiled from personal observation and experience, and although the conservative East is not nearly so liable to changes as the more progressive West, the Editor makes no claim to absolute accuracy in every detail; and he will feel indebted to an:y traveller who, from personal experience, may be able to Indicate errors or omissions in the Handbook. The same remark applies equall:y to the PRICES and various items of expenditure mentioned In the volume. The expense of a tour is much more directly affectcd by the circumstances of the moment and the individua.lity of the traveller in the East than in Europe; though it may here be added that the arrangements of Messrs. Cook and Gaze (pp. XIV, XV), of which most visitors to Upper EglPt will avail themselves, offer a comparative immunity agaInst extortion. A carefully drawn up contract will similarly protect those who prefer to hire a dhahabtyeh for themselves. DigitIZed by Coogle

Greater care is requtred in the choice of companions for the dhahabiyeh-voyage, for the close and constant intercours8' in rather narrow quarters and for haps two months at a time is apt to produce somewhat attained lations between those who are not originally sympathetic. The 'dhahabiyeh devil', indeed, is famolls in Egypt for causing those who have embarked as friends to disembark as foes. In especial ellers with scientiftc aims should avoid travelling with those who have no particular interest in the gigantic remains of antiquity, and who are thus constantly wishing to push on hurriedly from sheer ennui. In all cases it is prndent to distribute the various cabins and seats on the divan by lot before starting. . .

These steamers enable travellers to visit the chief pointa in Upper Egypt at a less expenditure of time and money than the tourist steamers.

Holders of Cooks' tickets may break their journey at Luxor or Assuan either on the way up or the way down (after previous rangement with Cooks' manager in Cairo), and proceed by a sequent Iteamer, if there are vacant berths. The mail-steamers, usually less crowded than the others, may be used in descending the stream. In all these deviation, from the usual tours, very strict adherence to the terms of the special arrangement is exacted. ellers are atrongly recommended to time their voyage so as to rive at Luxor 3-4 days before full moon; for moonlight adds a culiar oharm to a visit to the ruins here and at Assuin. Passengers by steamer should beware of the risk of catching cold by leaving the windows of their cabin open. They should also avoid placing themselves too near the edge of the deck; and it is well to remember (e.g. when shaving) that the steamera frequently run aground, especially above Luxor. Liability to delay through this last fact, makes it impossible to be sure of reaching Cairo in time to make connection with the ocean-steamers.

NILE JOURNEY. xix b. The Dhahablyeh Voyage. Though the voyage in a Dhahablyeh demands much more time and money than the steamboat-voyage, on the other hand it offers the only means of a satisfactorily close examination of the country and its monuments. A party of 4-0 persons will be found advisable, especially as the expense is not much more than for 1-2 persons. A large selection of good dhahabiyehs is to be found at Cairo, on the left bank of the Nile both above and below the new bridge at Bdlilt. Travellers who take the train from Cairo to Assidt should despatch their boat from Cairo about a fortnight in advance, for there are no good dhahabtyehs either at Assidt or farther up at Luxor and Assuan. In Cairo the best dhahabiyehs are those ing to Messrs. Cook & Son ('Isu', 'OsiriB', 'Horus', 'HatAor', thu', and 'Ammon-Ba', costing 1301. per month) or Messrs. Gaze & Son ('Se.oltru', 'Cheap,', 'Herodotua', and' Hope', 110'-per month). Other good craft, with the monthly hire, are as follows: 'Diamond' (1001.), 'Eva' (80l.), 'Admiral' (80l.), 'Timaah' (901.), 'London', 'L,,:r;or', (each 75l.), 'India' (801.), 'Alma', 'Nubia', nobia', 'Gamila' (each 9Ol.), 'Lotu,' (70l.), 'Meermin',' Manhattan' (each 70l.), 'Griffin' (80l.), 'Zingara' (6Ill.), and' Vittoria' (05l.). These prices include the hire of the dhahabiyeh and its full equipment and the wages of the re'ts or captain and the crew. For the services of a dragoman, cook, and attendant, and for provisions, saddles, and all the incidental expenses of excursions (excluding bakshtsh), the price per day and per pers. is calculated thus: -Cook Gaze Dragoman Party of 2, each pers. 33,. 30s. 30,. --3 --
28s. 27s. 24s. -" 24,. 25,. 20,. -5 22,. 20,. iSs. -6 
or more, 208. 16,. 16,. Thus for a voyage of 60 days from Cairo to Assuan and back, including the payment of a dragoman and all provisions (except wine, etc.), Cook charges o90l. for a party of 5 (i.e. 118l. each pers., or 39,. 4d. each per day). For smaller parties, the cost per head is considerably more. A three months' voyage in the 'Manhattan' (the property of a dragoman) costs 480l. for a party of 4. (i.e. 6t. 10,. per day, or 32 ŁŁ 6d. each pers. per day). The inclusive charge for Cook's excellent steam-dhahabtyeh 'Nitocru' (5 berths) is 400l. per month, a 8um that will not appear exorbitant when the time saved by steaming is taken into aocount. Those who employ Cook's or Gaze's dhababtyehs are relieved from all in the matter of engaging a dragoman (q uile indispensable to the traveller who speaks no Arabic) or purchasing proviaions. And there are additional advantages that the stores of meat, fowl., vegetables, and fruU can be replenished en rontc from the steamers, and in case of head-winds, the small Steam Towilag Laum1Ju belonging these firms, lIlay be htred for 6-8L per day.

II NILE JOURNEY. The chartering of a private dhahabiyeh is much cheaper though much more troublesome. The Ilrst step is to engage a Dragoman, not without a careful enquiry as to his record at the consulate and from the hotel-keepers, and an examination of the testimonials from previous travellers. There are about 90 dragomans in Cairo, all more or less intelligent and able, but scarcely a half of the number are trustworthy. Most of them speak English or French, and a few speak Italian. The following are well spoken of: Hallan Spe1ce, Al.tMd Ramada .. , Jbrahlm Solem, Al&_d Abdef'1'a/lim (owner of the Manhattan p. xix), Htuall Bihar" Salim Sadjar, B"hal Allad, Abdullah Abelellehaille lall these tians) I Saleh (a Nubian); Gall, biota Sapi .... a (Maltese); Maa ... , LetDitI Mall.flr, Daqbi. F"d1U, Bli". Tllha"", and Blitu Abw1l4/1a (Syrians). It cannot be too strongly impressed upon the traveller that it is essential for him to show from the very beginning that he is and intends to main the master. Even the best dragomans are inclined to patronize their clients, a tendency which must at once be quashed. The next step is to select a suitable dhahabiyeh assisted by the dragoman. A contract is then made with the dragoman, either trueting him with the entire preparations, or assigning to him only the duty of engaging and paying the re'is and crew, while the eller retains the commissariat department in his own hands. The re'is or steersman is a most important functionary upon whose skill during the often stormy passage the safety of the vessel depends. The crew number from 8 to 1'2 according to the size of the biyeh. The vessel is either hired by the day (for 2. pers. 5-6l., 3 or 4 pers. 6-7l.) or chartered for the whole return-voyage to ASSURD (for 2. pers. 300-350t., 3 or 4 pers. 350-4001.). In the former case the dragoman will try to travel as slowly as possible to protract his engagement; in the latter case he will press on, so as to save boat-hire and board. The latter arrangement is preferable, but the right of halting for 15-'20 days in the course of the journey should carefully be stipulated for. The dragoman must also provide keys and camels for the excursions. Farther details are indicated in the following draft-contracts, in which it is believed that nothing of importanee has been overlooked. The contraet must be signed at the traveller's consulate, either with the dragoman alone if he has undertaken the whole of the arrangements, or with the dragoman and re'ts, when the trawIler has hired the dbahabiyeh and pays board to the dragoman. Oontract with the Dragoman. -Mr. X. and his travelling companiona on the one hand, and the Dragoman Y. on the olher, have mutually entered into the following contract: -(1) The Dragoman Y. binds himself to conduct Mr. X. and his party {rom Cairo to .Assuin (or Wadi J;{alfab), and back, for t,he 8um of ..ŁŁ Jlounds sterling. ('.l) The Dragoman Y. shall exclusively defray the whole travelling expenses of the party, Including the hire of the dhahabiyeh, 8ufllclently manned, and eqnlpped to the satisfaction of Xr.

Other stores, such as eggs, fresh beef, bulfalo-meat, mutton, poultry, oranges, lemons, etc., are taken only in small supplies, it being easy to replenish the larder en route, either from the steamers or still better from the markets on the banks, where prices are derate.

The sailors accompany the hoisting of the lateen sail with a lusty chorus, and if one of the brisk 'Etesia' blows, which Herodotus mentions asdriYing boats up the Nile, the long pointed craft jlies quickly along, passing in rapid succession the Khedive's palace and the barracks of en-Nil, el-'Ain, the island of with its palaces (on the E. bank), and the teaux of Geztreh and Glzeh (W. bank). Old Cairo lies on the E. bank, and beyond it rise the Mts., with the citadel and Stabl 'Antar, a ruined Arab fort on the S. end of one of their spurs; on the W. is the group of pyramids at Gizeh. To the left (E. bank) farther on, are the quarries and hamlets of Turah and Ma',lIrah (see Baedeker's Lower Egypt, p. 403). Opposite, on the W. bank, rise the pyramids of Sanarah, and DahsMr. Near the bank, to the left, amidst a fine grove of palms, is a Coptic convent, and adjllcent is a gun-faotory, begun by Isma'il Pasha, but never finished. The steamer remains for some hours at BedraBh6n (rail. stat., p. 1), where asses are kept ready for a visit to Memphis, Sanarah, etc. (comp. Baedeker', Lower EMt, R. Opposite, on the right bank of the Nile, lies ij:elwan (ibid, p. 404), frequented as a ing-plaoe. -On the bank at Kafr el-'AlIilt (W. bank; rail. stat.), where the steamer lays to for the night, are some ancient tions which may have belonged to the Oanal of Menu. The important pyramids of Lisht lie to the right, while the singularly shaped pyramid of Mtdllm (the so-called 'False Pyramid') becomes. more and more prominent. on the W. bank, is the starting-point of the excursion to the pYramid and of Medllm (asses with poor saddles may be procured at the village; 2. fro and bakshish).

These were the tombs of the relationa of aaefru ('th Dyn.), and in many respects resemble the mausolea of whleh bear the same name. The of the most Important Of them are partly uncovered. The street of tombs, which is now accessible, sents the appearance of a hill-side covered with masonry, incmated with stucco, and provided with ante-ehambers. The mouth of each tomb Is towards the E.; the leaning external. walls are gener&l.ly of Nile bricka, richly embellished with the linear patterns which afterwards formed the favourite decorationa of the sides of the sarcophagi (which were tations of the The vestibule is in most cases tively large, but the inner corridors are narrow, alope downwards, and are covered with representations in a remarkably simple and antiquated .tyle. The arebaic eharacter of the scenes and of the hieroglyphiea proves the great antiquity of these monuments. The influence of the hieratic canon is already traceable here, but it does not appear to have hampered the efl'orts of the artists as much as it did at a later age. The admirably preserved colours are also less conventional. than those seen in later monuments. The flrst open tomb which we reach from the a., was that of Prince (Erpa Ha) Ne/erftI4I, who lived in the reign of King <:> Teta. (There were S kings of this name, in tbe 1st, 8M, and 6th n#iasty). On the left wall of the corridor leading to the tomb-chamber, we see the deceased in a sitting posture, and on the right wal.l he is represented standing, with his wife behind him. Adjacent are men and women presenting offerings, as in the of Ti and Ptahhotep. The flesh-tint of the men is red, and that of the women pal.e yellow, and this circumstance, ally in a monument of this early period, is important as tending to prove the Asiatic origin of the Egyptian nobles. The features of the persons represented are of the Caucasian, and not of the Ethiopian type. Among the villages belonging to Neferm&t, which offered gifts, there appears on the left the name of the district of =:=:s + IWWV\ G i.e. 'M.'an of the cattle'. Metun is the oldest form of the name From the neck of the ox, which represents the victim, flows a black stream of blood. On the right side we find among others a district named that 'of the white sow', which proves that pigs were reared in Egypt as early as the time of Snefm. The pig in this group Is very true to nature g In the name of the district Hal ... 801:, or 'place of the ploughing', the most ancient form of the plough Is used as a determinative symbol. The advanced condition of Industrial suits, showing that the Egyptians already praetisad the art in which, according to Pliny, they afterwards excelled, is proved by the charactar of the dress worn by the women represented on the rlght side of the flrst passage, consisting of black and white cotton stufl', with pleasing patterna on the borders. He tells us that they were not in the habit of painting the materlal.s for their dress, but of dipping them in certain fluids. They were coloured with boUing dyes, and came out impressed with a pattern. Although the boUers contained oue colour only, it is said to have imparted several different tints to the stuffs dyed in them. -In order to impart a durable colonr to the larger ligures represented here, an entirely unique process was employed. The outlines were graved on the stone, while the surfaces enclosed by them were dividad into deeply incised squares, which were fllled with stucco of different colours, the flesh-tint of the men being red, that of the women yellOW, and the colour of the robes being white, etc. DigitIZed by fioogle

4 ,Boute 1. A'fFIJ;r. Frllfri Caif'd , , A UWe faribe. to the N. is the tomb of Aft', the 'Wife of N efermlt. On the architrave over the doorway we see the husband of the deeeaaed in snaring birds, while a servant presents the spoil to the tress oC the house, whose eomplexion is of a brilliant yellow. On the outside wall, to the lett, we observe the catUe of the deceased browsing on reeds. On the right stands N efermat, who, as the inscri ption informs ue, 'caueed this monument to be erected to his gods in b.destructible ch .... cters'. Among the domestic anlmala are several cattle of Tery bright colours. We also notice a gazelle held by the horns by a butcher, who Is cutting off its head. Offerings of wine were also made at this early period. In the passage leading to the Serdab il a group ers busily at work. The hunting-scenes are curious, and, notwithstanding their simplicity, remarkably true to nature. Among them is a greyhound seizing a gazelle by the leg, and another carrying a long-cared hare. A few paces to the N.E. is another built of well-hewn bloekl of limestone. The hieroglyphics and low reliefs, resembling thOle in the tomb of Ti at are admirably executed. The deceased terred here was named JUtelll, and his wife JIiJra. Traversing the bule and a narrow passage, we reach a tomb-chapel wi th a lacrillcial table; in the passage, on the right, Is a handsome male llgure with a lasso, and on the left are stone-masons, engaged In making sarcophagi. On the left, in the innermost niche of this tomb, we perceive the ceased, and on the right, his wife. We next come to a ruined and to another tomb, half excavated, which was eonstructed for .Ba1&0-I.p, a son of Snefru, one of the highest civil and military 'dignitaries of the kingdom, and his wife Net'", a relation of the' royal family. The statues of this married couple, who died young, 0' at least are 10 sented, which are now among the principal treasures of the museum of Gizeh, were found here. Farther to the W. are several other tombs, now covered up. On the right bank, opposite Rinah and about 11/2 M. from the river, lies the hamlet of with some mounds of earth and debris representing the ancient Aphroaitopolil, the territory of which, according to Strabo, adjoined that of Acanthus (Dahsh1h), while Us capital lay on the Arabian bank of the Nile. A town of Aphrodite must also be one of Bathor, the Egyptian goddess of love, to whom the white cow, which Strabo says was worshipped here, was sacred i it was the capital of Matenn", the 22nd nome of Upper Egypt. Its hieroglyphic name was Tep head of the cow. In the Christian period (ca. 810 A.D.) Aphroditopolis gained lome brity from 81. blAlm" who fixed his in the mountaina to the E. of the town, beside a well and a group of palms. So many grims of every class, age, and sex sought out the holy man, that a regular posting ronte, with relaYI of camels, was laid oui aero .. the desert. St. ihony, however, lied from hi. admirer. and buried himself deeper in the mountains. Bui while he thul shook off his earthly visitants, he could not so easily e.eape those extraordinary tempters from at which Callot haa taught u. to smile, though to St. Anthony himself, as well aa to St. Hilarion and other similarly persecuted anchorites, the contest wu one of bilter earnest. The Coptic conve,nt of Mar Antonios (p. Ii), a few higher up, on the E. aide of the Nile, still lendl lupplies to the convent of 8t. Anthony, lituated in the heart of the Arabian Desert 4'.6). After passing a few small islands, we now reach (W. bank) 81-Waltah (pp. 1 and 36; post-office and Arab telegraph at the rail. sUt., 1/ .. M. from the Nile), where passengers bound for the Fayum leave the dhahabiyeh and betake themselves to the tJ'ain (see R. 2).

In this case the dhababiyeh should not be sent on in vance, but should be ordered to awall the traveller's return. -The py .... mid and tomb8 of Mid'm may al80 be visited from el-Waatah (888 p.2). A small canal, beginning near the village of Z8toiyeh (W. bank), runs out of the Nile into the Ba{&r 28). Farther up in the latitude of A\J.nis el-Medineh and Benifuat, there seems to have been another deep channel connecting the river with the Bahr Ydsuf. These four channels enclosed an inland which has been tified with the H""""IJ/}po,il"" Nome, unanimously described by Greek thorities as an island. Strabo, who visited it on his way to the Faydm, afler leaving the nome of AphrodUopolis, calls it 'a large island" and lates that in the city of Reracleopolia the ichneumon was worShipped, the deadliest foe of the crocodile, held sacred in the neighbouring nome of Arsinoii; for, he tells us! il crawls down the throat of the eleeping monster and devours its entruls. The large mounds of debris at Almlll M.d'".,., the Umm el-Elmdm ('mother of rubbish-heaps') of the Arab·s, have been identified with Heracleopolis; they lie 1111. to the W. (inland) of Benisuilf. The old name ot the town was KlIill.1UU, from which .41111111 i. derived through the Ooptic Hlle.. The ram-horned god Hor.""', the prince of terrors, was also worshipped here. A few columns still stand, here, and other monuments may be buried under the debris. Systematic excavations are to be undertaken. At ptesent need scarcely be visited except by those who approach the Faydm from Benlfuilf. . On the W. bank the mountains recede a little from the Nile, but on the E. bank their steep and lofty spurs frequently extend down to the bank in rising picturesque forms. None ofthe villages before need be mentioned. On the E. bank stands the Coptic convent of M8r Antonio. (see p. 4). About 2M. inland (right) from Z2t£in (W. bank) lies the hamlet of Bu.h (rail. stat., p. 1), which is inhabited by Copts and thus has some interest for those who wish to study these direct descendants of the ancient Egyptians in a community of some size. Benitu6f, on the W. bank, the first place in Upper Egypt (rail. stat., p. 1 i stat., 3/4 M. from the Nile), is a town of 10,000 inhab., pleasantly situated between the rail way and the river. It contains a post and telegraph office and is the capital of a province of the same name, which oontains 169 villages and about 220,000 tants. To the left of the rail. statiori is the Mudiriyeh, or residence of the mudir or governor. The houses or rather huts of this cial capital are, however, constructed of Nile mud. The manufacture for which this place was in the middle ages has greatly declined, but there are several sugar-plantations and a small bazaar. To the left of the railway is a fine grove of palms. A. road which was much frequented before the completion of the rail· way, leads from into the F"1I6m (p. 8'), and travellers with a tent and plenty of time might still hire camels, asses, or horses here and proceed to Medlnet .I-F",.". via e/-Lala' ..

The brotherhood of St. Anthony's Convent occupie. the highest rank among the religious societiea of the Monophysite feasion; aud the Patriarch, or head of the Coptic community, mut be .elected from their number. A visit to the convents, however, doe. not IlOmpensate for the fatigue aud trouble it iuvolvea. As far as Minyeh the space between the E. bank and the hills remains narrow, the rocks frequenUy abutting on the river in unbroken walls or rounded bluffs. Few villages are seen on this bank, but the fertile alluvial tract on the W. gide, iO-12M. in width. is thickly populated and carefully cultivated, exhibiting in profusIon all the cereals that grow on the Nile, date-palms, and sugar-cane. The huge sugar plantations present a busy scene in November, when the sweet juiee is collected from the canes and conveyed to the factories. which are a monopoly of the Khedive and follow each other in rapid succession. These factories are connected by the railway, and short branch-lines, used in harvest-time only, run from them to the plantations lying farther to the W. Their lofty chimneys impart a very modem-industrial appearance to the ancient land of the Pharaohs. Large barges full of sugar-canes and others with fellal)in going to work in the factories are met on the river. Most of the higher officials in the factories are Europeans. The juice is expressed from the cane and then reflned by being boiled twice in closed vessels. In an average year about 26,000 tons of sugar l1re produced in EgyP:l in 1889 the value of the sugar exported amounted to o09,Ouuz .. The boat passes two large islands. On the W. bank lie Balankah and Bibeh (rail. stat., p. 1). with large sugar-factories. The nel now contracts, and numerous islets are passed. Feslm (rail. stat ŁŁ p.1), on the W. bank, is 11/2 M. from the river. Near the village of el-Hibeh, on the E. bank, about 4.

Several trough-like hollows and clefts have been found here, some of which, in the rooks, are 'of oonsiderable size j but no inscriptions have been discovered.

Bitteh Ma"1Jam el-'Adhrah or convent of Lady Mary the Virgin, consists of a group of miserable huts, occupied not only by the monks but by laymen with their wives and children, and looks like a fortifled village. Most of the monks employ themselves in making shoes. The underground chapel in which service is held is uninteresting. The institution is very old, .and curious tales are told of it by Makrizl, Kazwini, Suyuti, and other AJ'abic writers. .

Farther to the 8. i8 a cololSal image, earved out of the rock, of Ramses III. sacrificing to the god Sebek. The inseriptlons in the very aDcieDt group of tombs tll the 8. are in such bad preaervation that their date caD only be guessed at from their general style. KiJlyeh (Minyd-ilm-KlIU81b; rail. stat., p. 1), on the W. bank, a well-built and handsome town with 16,900 lnhab., is the seat of the mudir of a district containing 281 villages and 315,000 tants. There is a telegraph-of1lce at the railway-station, and cent is thtl post-of1lce, the director of which speaks Italian. At the hospital is a physician who has studied in Europe. The town pos-. sesse8 two hotels and a large and curiously painted Arab cafe', in which ghawazi sing in the evening. Parts of the street running along the river are planted with trees, and in the stream many steamers and dhahabiyehs lie at anchor. l'he bazaars and the Greek bakka.ls' (small dealers) possess large stocks of goods. In the Bazaar street is an Austrian watchmaker and clothier, and among the houses on the river is an Italian tailor. The palace oithe mudir is a plain and lightly-built structure. The large sugar-factory is the oldest in Egypt, and a visit to it during the sugar-harvest is of great interest; most of the of1lcials are French and very obliging. Market-day in Minyeh presents a very gay and picture of Oriental life. There are no public buildings or monuments of any interest, but the houses of the richer merchant, in spite of their plain exterior, are often 1Itted up with great comfort. A glance into one of their courts will show what a rich and varied life exists in the interior of houses which from the outside look like able huts. It is uneeriaiD what place of the Pharaohs' time lIinyeh represents; but the OBIIertion of Leo Afrieanus that it was founded by the Arabs may well.be doubled. Among the facts which render it improbable are the old maaonry on the river (towards the S.), the aneient architectural ments immured in one of the mosques, a Coptic Inscription, and the very· Dame of the town, which is derived, not from the Arabie, but from the old-Egyptian dialect. Il. Coptic name is UOOItH (Moone) and tbis, as Brug.eh has demonstrated, is derived from the old-Egyptian Men.l. This name, however (in full Mena-I KhUj'u, 'nurse of Cheops'), belonged to a plaee which lay nearly opposite to the present lIUnyeh, on a site still marked b)' a few remains. At a later date lIena·t was probably ferred, under the name of Ilinyeb, from the right bank of the Nile to the left, where, presumably, Some of the inhabitants had previously settled. To this day the inhabitant. of Ilinyeh maintain a close connection with the E. bank of the Nile, conveying their dead for burial to Zriwi1lM, Damed el-Milin (i .Ł. 'of the dead') 5 M. to the S. EXOtJRSIOIi TO BBlII..,ASAIi, 15 iI. (see p. 12).

Thrice yearly, in the months of Regeb, ShawwU, and Dhil1}.iggeh t, at the time of full moon, funereal festivals, lasting several days, are celebrated here. Among the ceremonies observed are the offering of dates to the dead, which recalls the funereal offerings of the ancient Egyptians, and the presentation of palm-branches, recalling the Oriental bolism of early Christianity, still familiar in our churches. A few minutes' walk towards the S. brings us to the red mound of pottery and rubbish known as K8m which runs parallel with the Nile. Climbing over this we reach the burial-vaults of the primeval monarchy, which are situated among the Arabian hills, with their gates towards the river. The tombs are unCortunately in bad preservation, and some of them have been destroyed by violence, the stones being removed for D88 in ing. It is uncertain of what town this was the necropolis, but U edly belonged to the 16th nome of Upper Egypt, named Yah or JCaMl (gazelle)t in which the gazelle' waa held sacred. In this nome also lay the towns Of Heben and Nefma, the chief deity of which was represented .. .. sparrow-hawk standing On a gazelle, accompanied by Hathor, Hons, and Khnum.

SPEOS ARTEMIDOS. 1. Boute. 11 The 'Iluee weeks' .teamer halta here 8-4 hrl., while the 'Conr weeks' steamer remains overnight and leaves the entire forenoon for a visit to Speos Artemidos and Beni\tasan. The excursion begins at Speos dos, which lies to the S. (1/. hr. on donkey-back), whence we proceed toward. the N. to (1/. hr.) the foot of the tombs of BenlJ.tasan. We then walk to (10 min.) the S. graves and descend to N 08. 2 (Khnum-hotep) and 1 (Ameni-Amenemha) of the N. tombs, where the asses are in waiting to take us back to the steamer (1/. hr.). Travellers ascending the river In a dhahabtyeh should land at Benlhasan, ride to Speos Artemidos, and send the dhahabiyeh on to meet them near the village of Ben/ha,a" t/-.dhma,·. Those descending the stream save .. little time by landing at .. point somewhat nearer the tombs of Benihasan, almost opposite Benihasan d· Kadim (p. 12). Ł Ł Speoa Artemidoa (' grotto of Artemis'), known to the Arabs as Blabl 'Amar ('stable of Antar'; compo p. 88), is reached from the steamboat-landing, where asses are in waiting, in 1/2 hr. The route croues lI.elds and sand, finally ascending considerably. On the way carefully rolled cat -mummies are o1fered for sale, which have retained the unmistakeable odour of cats for thousands of years. The cat was sacred to the goddess Pasht whom the Greeks identifted with Artemis. The Temple of this goddess, hewn in the rock, consists of a vestibule and of an inner chamber conneeted with the vestibule by a corridor. Above the door of the vestibule is a long inscription of the time of the 18th Dynasty, which celebrates the goddess Pasht and also speaks, under the name of Amn, of the Hyksos in Avaris who from ignorance of the god Be destroyed the ancient temples.· The temple itself was founded by Tutmes nl. and renewed by Sed I. Of the 8 pillars which supported the vestibule all have been destroyed except two in the front row, which bear inscriptions and royal cartouches on their W. and E. sides only. On the W. side of the recumbent pillar to the right Champollion saw the name of Tutmes III. (0 E5 )1. All the other cartouches are thole of Seti L, Who is described as the favourite of the goddess PIJBht, .the mistress of Matmnv or the dweller in the mollDtain n 6 On the rear-wall of the vestibule . are some interesting representations. To the left is Pasht in the guise of a mighty sorceress, stretching out her left hand to king Seti I., behind whom, sitting in an attitude of benediction, is the god Ammon-Ra. To the extreme left is the small figure of the god Thoth, lord of Hermopolis. Appropriate inscriptions ale also furnished. To the right, in three rows, ale the deities ofSpeos ArtemidOl (1211.gures), beginning with Mentu and Tum, in front of whom is Thoth, who conveys to the loca.l gods the command of Ammon-Be that Seti I. sha.ll be raised to the throne of..HoruJt.

To the W. of the Speos Artemidos is a second grotto (perhaps merely a cat's tomb). on the outside of which are the interesting cartouches ot Ale2:afldft" II., son of Roxana, and six scenes representing the king in the company of the gods. -The dragomans now hurry on to (1/2 hr.) Beni1}.asan, where we ascend to the S. tombs. These, however, have been almost entirely destroyed, and the only one of any interest is No.7, the tomb of KheU, which contains hunting-scenes and fine clustered columns. Passing on we soon reach (8 min.) the higbly interesting N. tombs ot AmeRi (No.1) and Khnum-liotep (No.2); compo pp. 14-18. The necropolis of is one of the most iuteresting ill all Egypt, not only on account of the remarkable architectural features of the 12th Dyn. seen here, but also for the manifold presentations of scenes from the domestic life of the Egyptians at that early era. The journey from the Nile to the tombs takes from 8/. hr. to 11/. hr. according to the heifht of the water and the landing-place selected. Asses, with good saddles, .1l/z fro Candles, and if possible magnesium wire, should be takeu to light the tombs. The route lead8 towards the bare limestone hills, at first through groves of palms and then acros8 sand. The ancient B.nil'a.all t, B.,.i/'aaall el·Kadtm ('the old'), now desertedi lies to the right; the modern village is to the S. of the u8ual landing-p ate. On reaching the limestone hills we see the remains of a dilapidated path, supported by masonry, and ascend over debris to the horizontal hill-path, to the W. of which stretch the tombs. Before the traveller enters the tombs to inspect the tations within, he should examine the columns at the entrance. At first sight everyone will set these columns down as unmistakeable examples of the Doric order; but the indisputable testimony of the inscriptions informs us that they date, not from the Ptolemaic period, but from the invasion of the Hyksos, in the 12th Dyn., tween B.C. 2000 and B.C. 3000. Champollion named them hoto-Doric or Pre-Doric COlumfU. Since him many authorities, with these columns as their point, have tried to establish "the kinship of the early Greek order with the architecture of Egypt and to prove that the former was derived from the latter. These views, however, aroused keen op-t The place was deserted 80 or .to years before the visit of the Fren"h" ExpediUon, bec:ause the inhabitants wi.hed a wider spate for cultlvatioll near their village. which they ao:cordingly rebuilt farther to the 8.

14 Boule 1. BENIl;IASAN. Frotn Cairo in its Egyptian counterpartt. The columns of Beni\luan consist, like the Doric column, of a buis, an octagonal or sixteen-aided shaft with 16 or 20 tIutes, a capital, and an abacus. The echlnus or chymatium is, however, wanting. While the swelling or enbsis on some Doric columns, and also the annuli or rings at the top 01 the shaft, han hitherto met with no sufftcient explaaatlon, the same features appear as natural and necessary parts of the so-called 'plant column' of Egypt. The architects olthe NUe aimed conscioualy at a reproduction of the stem of a plant, and as the capitals sented a bunch of buda it was natural that the cords which fastened them should not be absent. Their number is five j and the 3 or 1) annuli at the top of a Doric column, erroneously explained as cisions made for the ropes used in hoisting it to its place, are simply an inheritanoe from the Egyptian column. The idea of the annuli, as of the entlre Doric column, is of Egyptian origin, though the perfect Greek column, with the beautiful transition-member formed by the eohinus, is far from a mere imitation. 'The Greek column haa become an entirely new form, animated by a new ciple proper to itself, which has thoroughly mastered the geneous elements from without and blended them in a new unity.' In farther emphasis of the importance of these oolumna in the story of art, we may remind the reader that the earliest Dorio umns known to us date from about the time that the P,amtikidae (p. xxix) were not only allowing the Greeks to enter the valley of the Nile but were inviting them to settle there, and that the umns of Beni\lasan are 1500 years older than this. The columns of Beni\lasan are indeed nothing more than the pillars in the Temple of the Sphinx and the (Baedeker's Lower Egypt, pp. 366, 379) provided with tIutes and chamfered edges. The two tombs of chief interest, the farthest to the N., are easny recognised by the beautiful polygonal columns at their entrances. The donkey-drivers make directly for them, paying no attention to the otheD. The numbering begins at the N. end. Tomb 1. The exterior of the pronaos or vestibule is guished by two fine octagonal columns, bearing a fiat vault hewn out of the rock. Four sixteen-edged columns, with narrow tIuting, stand in the interior of the tomb-chamber and appear to bear the three beautifully patnted arches of the celling, which are hewn in the form of shallow barrel vaulting. The aide-columns touch the right and left walls of the nearly square chamber, in the rear of which opens a recess containing the statues (much dilapidated) of the deceaaed and his two wivea. The usual long shaft leading to the bottom of the tomb and the chamber for the corpse at the end of it are also present.

BENIIJASAN. 1. Route. 15 the son of the Lady Hannu, who was one of the chief dignitaries of the kingdom, bore the title of an erpa ha or prince, governed the nome 01 Ma\1 in time 01 peace, and commanded a diviltion 01 the army in war. To the left and right of the entrance he is ed on a throne 'With lions' feet, holding his commander's baton in hi. hand. Inside the door are two well-preserved inscriptions, cut in the stone. That to the right (S.) informs us that Amenemha departed this life in the '&srd year of Usertesen I., corresponding to the 26th year of the governorship of Ameni. He undertook all his wars 'sailing up-stream': -i.e. he campaigned only against the dwellers of the S., the 'miserable Kushites', as they are called in the inscription. In those days the arms of the Pharaohs had not yet been carried toward. the E. The Sinai peninsula, with its mines, is the only district in this direction which excited the tion lust of conquest. From his southern campaigns Amenemha brought home much gold and other booty. The inser1ption to the left (N.) also mentions a victorious campaign towardl the S., but is <>f lpeciat interelt for the light it throws on the truly human feelings of this bye-gone time. Amenemha describes his tion. in time of peace as follows (beginning at the fourth line from below): 'I cnltivated the entire nome of Ma\1 with many people. I troubled no chUd and oppressed no widow, neither did I keep a ftsherman from his ftshing or a herdsman from his herd. There was no head of a village whose people I had taken away for compnlsory labour, and there was no one unhappy in my days or hungry in my times. When, however, a famine arose, I tilled all the bIds in the nome of Ma1}., from its S. to its N. boundary, and gave nourilhment and lile to its inhabitants. So there was no one in the nome who died of hunger. To the widow I allowed as much as to the wife of a man, and in all that I did I never preferred the A1'eat man to the small one. When the Nile rose again and thing fiourilhed -ftelds, treel, and all elle -I 
cut o:\y nothing from the fields'. The paintinga in the interior of the tomb-chamber proper are unlortunately very much faded, and they have also been siderably injured, especially in recent years. Some ftgnres of riors which ltill remain, armed with elub and axe or club and lance, have a foreign appearance, as their skin is of a lighter colour than that of the Egyptians, and their hair and beards are red.

16 Route 1. BENII;lABAN. From Cairo which the names of women fill a very important role. Amenemha n. Ra-nub-kau 0 I'i?I UW created KhnwDhotep governor of the E. nomes, and as the heir of hiB maternal grandfather made him priest of Horus and Pasht in the town of MenAt Khufu (Minyeh). The portico or vestibule of this tomb deserves particular tion, as it not only possesses proto-Dorio columns resembling those of Tomb 1, but also shows some architectural forms, whioh seem intended to reproduce the beams and rafters of buildings above ground. The cornice projects strongly above the al'f?hitrave and is supported by fine laths ;hewn, like all the rest of the struoture, out of the living rock. The resemblance of these laths to the tules of the Doric order is not especially striking in itself, but taken in conj\!.nction with other points of similarity is, perhaps, worthy of mention. -The interior of Khnumhotep's tomb is richly adorned with paintings. Most of the representations were painted on a thin layer of stucco, witli which the limestone walls were coated. At the foot, however, is a long inscription cut in the rock, in lines of a greenish colour, 'J,tj'}, (t. high. [In 1890 the royal names were cut out of the rock by some vandal hand and offered for sale.l From thiB inscription we receive information about the family of Khnumhotep, who owed the greater part of his dignities to his maternal father, about his relations with Amenemha II., who, at the cession of hiB mother, made him a royal governor, and about the benefits he had conferred on his government and its people and the honour he had done to the gods of his nome and the manes of hia forefathers. " " The paintings have unfortunately suffered so much in the last 30 or "40 years, that the subjects of some of them are now almost indistinguishable. Most of them, however, were copied by Lepsius, Rosellini, Wilkinson, and others, while they were sWl in fair servation; and they have furnished most important contributions to our knowledge of the priTate life of the ancient Egyptians. In the uppermost row of paintings, above the door, was :represented the festival of the opening of the tomb of Khnumhotep. 'The heaven opens', says the inscription, 'as the god (i.e. the deceased formed into Osiris) steps forth'. To the right, lower down, we see the colonnades of Khnumhotep's dwelling, with servants measuring and registering his treasures and (farther on) bringing his eorn into the barns. Two of the lower rows show the operations of ploughing, harvesting, and threshing. Still lower down iB a Nile-boat, ing the mummy of the deceased, as the inscription iuforms us, to Abydos (the grave of Osiris), while the high-priest imparts his blessing. Below is a representation of the vintage and of the ing of fruit and vegetables. The cattle in the water and the fishing scene (at the foot) vividly recall the similar sceues in the of Ti.

The most esting of the soenes of artizan life in the lower rows are the representations of women baking and weaving, under the supervision of eunuohs. -The entire Rear WaU is oooupied by a tastefully arranged representation of the water-sports in which the deceased took delight. A forest of papyrus reeds grows by the water-side, thickly peopled by all kinds of furred and feathered game. To the right and left Khnumhotep is depioted in his boat, accompanied in one instanoe by his wife Khuti, who is painted a lighter oolour. Here he mnsll.xes large river-lI.sh, there he holds the birds he has brought down by bis darts. Above are birds caught in a net. In the river swim characteristically drawn lI.sh, and crocodiles and potami are also seen. A man who has fallen into the water is being hauled ont again. The dominant idea of the chase is farther carried out in the representations of a hawk seizing a gaily-plumaged bird and an ibis capturing a butterfly. The N. Walt (to the left on entering) is the most important of all, as upon it is the celebrated picture of a Semitic race bringing oosmetics (mestem) and other presents to Khnumhotep. In the lowest row, to the right, are seen the secretaries of Khnumhotep, receiving the report of the steward of the cattle, who is followed by the herds and shepherds. Just above this is Khnumhotep himself, represented on a scale three times as large as the other lI.gures and accompanied by three dogs and a man with sandals, bearing a staft'. In t.he 4th row from below, on a level with the head and shoulders of this huge lI.gure, is represented a curious procession. N eferhotep, the secretary, and another Egyptian lead towards the governor a number of foreign people in gay-coloured garments, whose sharply cut f eature8, hooked noses, and pointed beards 
unmistakeably claim their Semitic nationality. This Asiatic visit seems to have been one of the signal events in the life of the nomarch. Neferhotep hands his master a document from which we learn that the strangers knock ed at the door of Egypt in the 9th year of king Usertesen II. Prince Absha, the leader of the foreigners, leads a gazelle and bows to the ground.

The Hyksos, named 'Amu' in an insoription in the neighbouring Speos Artemidos (p.11), sisted of isolated tribes, who purchased permission to enter Egypt by tribute, l'llOssed its boundaries, and An ally penetrated to the terior. The cbief Absha here bows before the Egyptian i his cessors carried things with a high hand and bent the Egyptians under their yoke. -The tIock of ostriches behind the last Amu belongs to the series of pictures on the left side of the wall, presenting Khnumhotep, accompanied by his dogs, slaying wild beasts with bow and arrows. Below is a tIock of geese and a ing-scene. In the second row from the foot are bulls ftghting and scenes of cattle-tending. The 8.

That of Kheti, one of the nearest (No.7), easily recognised by the three pairs of columns supportlng the roof, contains interesting, though half-obliterated representations of the innumerable gymnastic and fencing exeroises and games of the ancient Egyptians. Girls are seen throwing the ball from one to another, and men ponder carefully over a game of draughts. The Hunting &enu are ot linguistic value, as the names of the different animals are written above them.

Hence the town was also named Po, 2'."u", or tOWIl ,of 'llhoth. Hermo,po1is Magna was the capital of the Hermopolilan 'nome of Upper Egypt. The name Ashmun"n Is derived, according to Quatremere (Memoires Geographiques, I., pp_ 490 et seq.), from the fact that the town embraced two dilferent communities, one 
on'thll aite of the ruios, the other, with a Ilarbour, on the Nile. Among the' plates of the French Expedition are two views of a fine Po,,"co of the Ptolemaic period, with two rows of six columns each (Anilquites IV, Pl. 00, li1). The columns were li5 ft. high, and the portico wjWl 12f.1/. ft_ long alld 291/. ft. wide. In lIinutoll's 'Journey to the Oasis of' .Jupiter' Ammon' (Plate XIV) a view is given of one of the cOlumns; with the' cartouche of Philippus Arid8!u8, one of the successors 0 Alexander the Great, who was a native of, Ashmun"n.

on the opposite bank of the river (comp. Tell el-Amarnah, p. 22). Nearly opposite R6cJ,ah, on the E. bank, 11 M. from Beni:ttasan, lies the village of 8h2kh 'AbIldeh, with the ruins of Antinol. Hadrian erected a new town in honour of his favourite Antinous on the site of the Egyptian town of Be8a, where the handsome youth is said to have drowned himself, to fulftl the oraole which predicted a heavy loss to the emperor and 80 to prevent a more serious disaster. The village lies on the bank amid palms of usual size and beauty, and to the S. of it is a brook, now dry except after rain, which must formerly have :ftowed throngh the town. The remains of public buildings of the Egyptian period are scanty. The French Expedition saw a triumphal arch, a theatre, and two streets :ftanked with columns, the one running N. and S_ and leading to the theatre, the other at right angles leading to the city-gate aud the hippodrome. A lofty column bore an inscription of Alexander Severus (A.D. 222). To-day, however, there are few remains either of Greek or Roman times. Among the palms lies a Ine Corinthian capital. The marble belonging to the 'very :ftne gate of the Corinthian order' that Pococke saw here and figured in his book was burned to make lime for building the sugsr-factory at R6cJ,ah. The extensive ruins of the ancient town lie to the E. of the village-of Shekh 'Abldeh. The streets and ground-plans of the houses are still recognisable.

20 Boute 1. DER EN-NAKHLEH. From Cairo Those who are interested in Christian antiquitie. should follow the E. bank from Shekh 'Ab!deh towards the S. t In about 3/, hr., after passing some ruins of a late epoch, we reach the D6r Abu HeJUlis (Convent of St. John), called also simply ed-D2r. In the days of the Mameluke persecutions the Christians are said to haye lived here and at Shell 'Ab&deh in comparative security, as the Arabs believed that no Mohammedan could exist here on account of the evil spirits. At present there are more fella1}.in here than Copts. There is little to be seen at ed-Der. The crypt, in which divine senice is held, is said to date from the time of the press Helena. By ascending the hill at the back of the houses, we reach, to the left of the ravine, some cave-like quarries, which were Iltted up as Christian chapels and were embellished at an early date with sculptures. The main chamber contains paintings of saints and soenes from the New Testament, but those in one of the side chapels (Raising of Lazarus, Wedding at Cana, etc.) are better. To judge from their style these interesting pictures are not earlier than the 6th cent. A.D. Among the Coptic monks who resided here (from the 4th cent. onwards) were Victor and his brother Koluthus, Silvanus, and Macarius j and the tombs of the last two . are still shown. The adjoining quarry was begun by Amenhotep III. About 3/, hr. beyond Der Abu Hennis we reach D6r en-:Rakhleh. the 'convent of the date-palms'. To reach the *Tomb with the presentation of the tranaportation of a 001088u3, we cross the dry water-course beyond the houses, ascend the hill on the left slde, and near the top reach a path on which, a little to the right, the grave is situated. Guides may be procured for a few paras. ellers descending the river should visit the tomb from Ber.heh, above which towers the rocky Gebel Sh2lr.h Sa'1d (with a shekh'lo tomb), in which the tomb in question is hollowed out. The whole district belonged to the nome of Un or Hermopolis. The tation in this tomb is highly interesting as being the only one that gives us an idea of the processes used by the Egyptians in mOving their colossal statues. The Arabs thought it impossible that mere human strength could move luch huge burdens, aud hence a legend grew up among them that the subjecu of the Pharaohs were glanu, who knew how to move masses of rock with their magioal stavea. Even the men of the preaent day, at whose command stand forces of which the ancient Egyptians never even dreamed, are astounded at their achievements in this direction and feel lucllned to solve the problem by ascribing to them the use of technical aids, which we have no evidenoe that they possessed. The principles of the pulley and the lever seem to have been unknown to them; and 0 stacle8, which seem to us to demand imperatively the applioation of steam and machinery, were overcome by enormous multiplication of .heer human power. t The dhahabiyeh should be sent on to Ber8heh. in order to allow time Cor a visit to the picture of the transportation of an Egyptian statue (see above).

DtR EN-NAKHLEH. 1. Route. 21 The colossal figure within this tomb represents Kai, son of hotep, a high-priest, a steward of the mysteries ofthe word of God, a privy chamberlain lsuperintendent of the works in the inner ace), and the head of a nome. His paternal grand-mother was a daughter of Usertesen I., the second king of the 12th Dynasty, and he was also connected with the royal family on the sitie. He was likewise related to the family of Nehera and hotep (see p. 15). The suceessfo) transportation of the statue dgured In his tomb was one of the chief events m the life of Kal. The scene shows ns an image, is ells In securely fastened to a sled. Small cushions are Inserted to prevent the polished stone from being injured by the ropes. To the sled are attached four strong cables, each manned by 4S workmen (in all 172), the 'young men', as the inscriptions inform us, 'of the W. and E. of the nome'. On the lap of the dgure stands a man clapping his hands, probably the leader and time-giver of the song of the workmen, whose task was facilitated by rhythmical movement. To this day In Egypt and elsewbere the same custom is observed wberever the strength of many men is united in some common exertion, as in the sailor's chant In raising the anchor or hoisting sail. A man facing the time-keeper knocks two wooden stamps together, obviously to transmit the ,roper time to those too far off to hear distinctly the hand-clapping 0 the leader. On the prow of the sled, behind the rings to which the ropes are fastened, stands a man pouring water on the ground to prevent the heavily loaded sled from taking dre by friction. Water-carriers staud ready to refill the empty pitcher. These are followed by other labourers bearlug notched beams, for laying under the sledge when necessary. Three bailiffs or stewards, with sticks, are each attended by four men, who seem from Ihelr simple costume to be foremen, stone-masons, or extra-hands. At the top are depicted seven well-equipped companies of infantry, marching in stiff military order towards Ihe ad vaneJng colossus. The ofdcers bear tridents resembling Ihose in the usual representations of Neptune, which may either have been used as deld-standards or for driving the cowardly into action. This highly instructive representation shows, among other points, how unlimited was the authority of the nomareh oVer the people of his nome and how freely, not to say extravagantly, he could apply human labour in effooting his ends. One is tempted to pity the corvee labourers and to forget how ends which seem petty or even obnoxious to one generation may have seemed to their ancestors worthy of an unlimiled expenditure of time, blood, and weallh. In the time of the building 12th Dynasty it was accounted "noble and reputable Ihing 10 ereet the hugest and most durable monuments. The mass of the people, who seem to have regarded the might of their oppressors in the same light as we regard the workings of destiny, were proud to have ha<l a share in the erection of any specially important monument. Similar considerations are suggested by scenes in the tombs of the pyramids, and the in.cription accompanying the above-described picture give. us chapter and verse for the accuracy of this view.

The fact that the portrait-like reliefs of men In these tombs, as well as the horses and buildmgs, appear more true to nature than in any other Egyptian monument may be due to tba greater .of divergence from the hieratic canon allowed in a reign which was so unfavourable to the priestly dogmas.

The mummy shafts, in spite of their great depth, have all long since been despoiled of their contents. In the very first tomb we find a representation of the king and his family offering a sacrifloe to the sun's disc. The disc Is encircled with the Urams-snake and furnished with several arms, stretehing wards; the hands are symbolic of energy, liberality, and the creative faculty. Dwarfs (then, as later, a favourite royal plaything), bearers, and bowing courtiers stand below. In front is the martial with his baton. To the left of the first grave, on the hill, is the Tomb of Pentu (No.2), which is in a very ruinous dition. Farther on to the left is that of Rameri (No.3), with a finely worked exterior. On the left wall of the second chamber of this tomb is a military scene, which we do not hesitate to describe as the most realistic representation found hitherto in any Egyptian grave. The lean figure of the Pharaoh, above whom the sun spreads its arms, stands in his war-chariot and drives the fiery steeds, the duction of which Egypt owes to the Hyksos. Sais (out-runuers) with long staves run in front of the chariot, towards the crowd of people offering sacrifice and bending to the ground in adoration. Standard-bearers and soldiers clear the way for the rapidly cing procession,just as the mouuted kavasses still do for the carriage of the Khedive. The king appears once more followed by his children, who also dri ve their own chariots. The procession hastens wards the royal palace, which covers the right part of the rear-wall of the chapel and also part of the right wall, affording us a clearer idea of an Egyptian palace than any other scene of the kind. It has long been established that neither the royal princes nor even the Pharaohs themselves lived in the temples. Un the contrary they used to build themselves airy chateaux of light materials, with doors opening on shady galleries and colonnades. Gardens with fountains and water-basins surrounded the building, near which were also out-houses, stables, and well-stocked storehouses, in quantity corresponding to the huge number of the dependents of tho royal family. The great entrance-door is dignified with double rows of bud columns, and red standards wave from lofty flag-staffs. Above one of the side-doors is a round window similar to those which the French call mil-de-breuf. The palace is adjoined by a sepulchral chapel, supported by columns and containing figures of the king's ancestors, honoured by rich sacrificial offerings; at the door is a choir, singing pions songs of remembrance to the paniment of the harp, and taking its time from the hand-clapping of the leader (a custom still preserved in Egypt). -In the first chamber of Tomb 7 (right wall, p. 26) is a representation of the Temple of the Solar Disc, with a large peristyle court surrounded by a colonnade. Pillars resembling Caryatides decorate the walls, and above all tower the lofty pylons with their JH.UoWrR"lnice. Digitized by GOUCS1t::

The forms of the persons represented vary considerably from those seen in tombs elsewhere. Almost alI have the same thickset body and lean neck that characterize the king. The figure of the latter is, of course, a portrait; and it is possible that the courtly artists dened the subjects with the weaknesses of the prince so that his formities might not appear as anything unusual. Amenhotep IV. was certainly 1I0t a foreigner; but his mother Tit may have been one, and may have instslIed her fellow-countrymeu at the Egyptian court. Even the highest dignitaries have un-Egyptian features. Among these is the royal favourite Merira, who is represented 011 the right walI of Tomb 3, as literally overwhelmed with the golden necklaces, rings, and orders, which the Pharaohs of the 18th Dynasty delighted to shower on their loyal adherents; he stands in front of the royal family, the members of which are attended by fan-bearers and tIOurtiers of all kinds. 'Let him receive gold', says the tion, 'on his neck, on his back, and on his feet'. Secretaries make a note of the donations and write out the royal patents, which are also mentioned elsewhere. The fourth necklace is being hung round the neck of Merira, while the fifth and sixth are handed to him by two officials; a third attendant holds three golden rings. The Urma, to whom this favourite belonged, were, in addition to their other dignities, the most learned physicians and high-priests of IIeliopolls (mentioned in the insoription). The sickly prince turally pays the highest honours to his physician, one of the Urma priests. Another of these priests, named Khui, is mentioned in the Ebers Papyrus as having prepared a famous eye-salve, and it is sible that Amenhotep IV. may have been blind or, at least, ed with blindness. His outstretched neck suggests the attitude of a blind man, and in the song of one of the priestesses by the door-post of the same tomb occur the words: 'The lord of goodness arises. Ł ŁŁ No other oue opens his countenance, healing his eyes with his beams'. Tomb 4 contained the remains of the 'truth-loving' Aahmes, the royal secretary, adjntant of the fan-bearers, and 1lrst lord of the bedehamber. Here we find one of the great dignitaries celebrating the glory of the sun. He praises the beauty of the setting of the lord of the lords and princes of the earth, at sight of whom the elect break forth into rejoicing, at whose risine: and settirur ,ttwl\!.hole "tllgltlzed by GOvCS1t::

The Temple of the Sun, Gn the tight wall of the first chamber, has already beEm mentioned. The king is 
shown seated upon a lion-guarded throne, illuminated by the so,lar rays, and };IGrne"by several courtiers. BefGre and behind are Doble yOuths with large and small fans. The same chamber contains another striking and well-preserved scene, representing the studiO' of the sculptGr Auta, director of the portrait-sculptGrs (lit.

It was destined for Mafia, a commander of the royal police, and scenes from bis life (Arrest of mountaineers, Escort of the king's equipage, etc.) are depicted on the walls of the :first chamber (esp. to the right of the entrance). In the right side-wall is a .door bearing a prayer in behalf of Ilb.hu to (the.radi"ting solar disc). -The next tomb, that of the royal official Tutu, contains (to tho right of the entrance) the almost complete text of a hymn, sung by a priest in praise of the lun: 'The breath of the wind', says the hymn, 'enters their nostrils, and Thy' gift it is that they have being.

This tomb also possesses a 'papyrus' column, of unusually careful workmanship and elaborate ornamentation. The basis of the pital is encircled, among tbe leaves, by a Urmus-serpent; and at the. upper end o( the, shaft, ,below the richly-adorned band cing the. annuli, are singular decorations consisting of sacrificial gifts, including many birds in groups of :five. -To the S., at a little distance, lies the tomb designated by Lepsius a8 No. 1. This al80 is dedicated to a high dignitary named Ai, perhaps the same as in Tomb 3. On the entrance-wall to the right is represented a festival, which Bome interpret as that of an order, while others take it for the marriage of Ai, fan-bearer and commander of cavalry, to the royal nurse. The king, denoted by the disc, his wife, and his daughters stand on a dais. The courtiE\ls, from the charioteers to the military officers and fan-bearers, receive with deep obeisances the decorations which the Pharaoh, the queen, and the princesses throw down to them. The foremost dignitary already wears six necklaces, and the lady behind him is just adding a :fifth to the four ahe already possesses. A troop of dancers enlivens the ceedings by energetic leaps and contortions, and secretaries make a note of the donations. To the S. are several other graves, clnding thoBe of Apii and Bamsu, the latter a general and lain of Ame'nhotep In. To the N.N.W. of these tombs lay the huge residence of the singular king Khu-en-aten, which was perhaps destroyed by the same generation that obliterated his name from the cartouches.

In a ravine Ilear el-HalDataA (E. bank) stands a stele with a hieroglyphic inscription, discovered by the late Mr. Harria, British consul at Cairo and excellently versed in Egyptian antiquities. Farther on we skirt an island and reach the point on the W. bank, between the villages of et-Gestreh (i.e. 'island') and el-Mandurah, where the Ba\U" ytlut or Joseph's CaMl, an arm of the Nile, verges from the main stream to water the agricultural districts of the Libyan bank, the FayUm (p. 36) etc. The name of Joseph, was given to it by the Arabs, who recognise in the son of Jacob the type of all administrators. It probably owes its regulation if not its origin to Amenemha III., of the 12th Dynasty. Extensive workl are now in progress to furnish the W. part of the Libyan bank with water from a point higher up the Nile, near Assiil.1. About !'i M. below the divergence of the Ba1}.r Yil.suf, at some distance -from the Nile, lies D6r6.t elh-Sherlf (rail. stat., p. 1). About 11/, M. above (S. of) the fork, on the E. bank, are some brick ruins; and 11/, M. farther to the S. are the mounds of D2r probably the site of the ancient This is the N. boundary of the dum-palms, which, however, do not attain their full development tlll farther up, between Assiu1 and where we see many fine specimens (p. 70). The Arabian Mts., rising in precipitous rocky walls, approach the river. Swallows, ducks, and other birds inhabit the eaves in the porous rock on the banks, and By in and out in screaming crowds. The elilfs on the right bank of this part of the Nile are known as Gebel Abu P6dah, The stream below them is considered the most dangerous part of the channel between Cairo and Assdn. Violent winds blow round the crags, and numerous sandbanks impede navigation. The Arabs tell that a ship-master of Keneh, having safely arrived at Bulil.lM was asked by his friends how he had passed the Gebel Abu 'Iluite easily', was his rejoinder 'there's no danger there'. An old man who overheard him remarked: IFrom yonr own words I see that you do not know this mountain', 'I know it as well as my own eyes" said the boatman. 'When I relurn 10 I must pa,. it once more. If my vessel suft'ers any damage in doing 80, I will pay you 10,000 piastres, on condition that you pay me the like sum if I pass safely. But I give you due warning tbat I know the Gebel Abu FMah perteeUy well'. The old man accepted the wager, and Ihe ship-master had hi. boat bound with iron, engaged the best sailors, and set forth. As he approached the Gebel the boat was assailed at IIrst by one wind, and afterwards by four winds, each blowing from a dUferent quarter.

Some of these are of great size, and in other cases bundles of 26 baby-crocodiles put up together. Baskets of bast cOlltain crocodile-eggs, with the shells, ing the embryo, still unbroken. After some time we reach a more spacious part oUhe grotto, where it is possible to stand erect. It i8 not improbable that the, cave had" second entrance on the oth\ll side of the hill, this has nQt yet been disqovered.

There they swarm like worms in the water of the river and around the cliffs that form the cataracts'. In his time there were still crocodiles in the Delta. These animals are now totally extinct on the lower Nile; none has been seen for 'many years' between Cairo and Gebel Abu F6dah, and they are becoming very rare between the latter point and Assu8.n, mainly, it is said, owing to the noise of the boats. Even between the First and Second Cataracts they are now rare, though 20 years ago they were very frequent. The road to Assiut, which we encountered on our visit to et-Tell (see p. 22), leads across the Gebel Abu FMah and reaches the Nile at Beni nllar the S. base of this hilI. In the hill beyond Beni are some tombs of the 6th Dyn., with esting and half-effaced representations of agricultural and other scenes.

In the desert, between the convent and the hills, are some scanty fragments of walls of brick, which seem to have belonged to the fortifled camp. Between Monfalut and Assiftt (26 M. by water, 17 M. by land) the Nile makes several great bends, which occasion a good deal of delay to navigation.

Copts. The mountains of the E. bank now recede, and the foot-hills of the Libyan chain approach the river, on the banks of which grow several Ane groups of sycamores. The minarets of Assiftt now come into sight, and numerous dredgers are seen at work in the canals. We land at eZ-Qamrah, the palm-enclosed harbour of Assiftt, with its steamers and other boats. Passengers by railway reach A88ill* in the evening after dark, as the train is not due Ull 6.80 l1.m. and is generally late. Those who do not wish to spend a day here, 1D order to see the town and the neighbouring tombs (p. 82), should at once transfer themselves and their luggage to the steamer (dragoman of the steamboat agents at the station). The path to eJ-Hamrah (see above), a walk of about 20 min. (donkeys for hire), leads along' the railway track, and, as it is not lighted} a man should precede the party with a lantern. The train, however, orten runs right down to the harbour. On reaching the steamer the traveller should at once make sure that all his baggage has been brought aboard. Asyil#, or Si1i.# (New Hotel, kept by O. Benois, near the tion, 121. per day, not very good), 252 M. from BUlalJ:, . is one of the oldest and now one of the most important towns on the Nile, taining 31,600 inhab., a railway station, and steamboat, post, and telegraph offices. There are British, American, French, German, and Austrian consular representatives. The public baths are well Atted up. The Egyptian Mission of the American Presbyterians (100 tions, 26 churches, 97 schOOlS) has one offts stations here, with interesting schools for girls and boys. The sacred name of the place, Paanub (,town of the wolf-headed Anubis') or Pa ap kemii ('S. town of the way-opener, i.e. Anubis) gave rise to its Greek name of Lycopolis ( see below). Its secular name, even in the ancient ---Q kingdom, was Jf G Saut, Coptic SWllt. No other town, exoeptMildftm, has preserved its aneient name with so little change. With the exception of a few fragments of columns, nothing remains of the living quarters of the ancient town, but the older part of the necropolis contains lIome very interesting relics of early times. PIoU"UI, the greatest of the Neo-Platonic philosophers (2OIj-Z70 A. D.), was born here in the beginning of the Srd cent., and his system was not uninfluenced by the priestly doctrines of his native town. From the ginning of the Ith cent. onwards Christianity was dominant in the town and neighbourhood. Pious believers took refuge in the caves of the necropolis to live a life of penitence apan from the world. One of these, Jolin 01 LIICDpoli" at the end of the 4th cent., bore the reputation of a Baint and even of & prophet. Theodoaius sent an embassy to him to quire the outcome of the civil war. The anchorite foretold a complete but bloody victory, and this prophecy was fulfilled in the victory of Tbeodosiu. over Eugenius at Aquileia in 59l A.D. The life of the saint of Lycopolis was written by his friends Rutinus and Palladius. The grotto that he occupied cannot now be distinguished from the numerous others in the hills; but the rocky chamber of another hermit of the name of John can be identified in the vicinity of Benil;>asan, for he wrote on the wall the Coptic phrase: 'm&ke prayers for me miserable. I am John'. Tow&rds the end of his life St. John of ASBillt lived in the Convent of the Seven Hills, at the top of the ·ridge, which was named after him the Convent of St. John the Leu.

1. Route. 33 cemetery. On the way, especially in the forenoon, we often meet funeral processions, resembling, with their wailing women and water-distributors, those of Cairo, but producing a much more solemn effect through the absence of the bustle of the crowded streets &ltd the presence of the deserted oity of the dead. Nowhere, not even in Cairo, are the funeral songs so strange and weird as here, or sung by such deep and tuneful voioes. At the foot of the hill we dismount and follow the good path which leads to the most interesting tombs. A tomb below, near the Arab cemetery, is llnimportant. Mighty grandees of the ancient empire, who filled the highest secular' and ecolesiastical offices, hewed huge vaults in the rocks here for the reception of their mies. Other tombs, smaller and less elaborately decorated, belong to simple burghers of a latsr period j and there are also holes in the rock for mummies of the jackal, which was sacred to Anubis Apheru, the local deity of Assiftt. It is this animal that the Greeks in this instance wrongly called Lykos or wolf (whence Lycopolis), but a few genuine wolf-bones have also been discovered here. Mummified dogs, kittens, and birds of prey have been found, wrapped in linen bands and sometimes adorned with gilding. Those who do not ject to oreep into some of the dusty and ill-smelling holes will still easily find fragments of sacred animals. The jaokal, along with the Urleus-snake, Baunted proudly on the standard of this nome, the chief town of which was the oapital of the whole of Upper Egypt in the time of the ancient empire. The path; whioh is well-made though somewhat steep, leads us first to a large rock-hall, the ceiling of which is roughly hewn in the form of a vault and still bears traoes of blue stars painted on a yellow ground. Sadly defaoed inscriptions, in the style of the cient empire, cover the walls. The hieroglyPhics on the door are half obliterated, but enough remains to 'show that this was the grave of I!ap-Zefa, son of Dame At at, a high-priest, and governor of S.Egypt. 'rhe Arabs call it Jalab' 'Antar, or the stable of Antar, a hero of tradition (comp. their name for the Speos Artemidos at Benil)asan, p.11). The ·View from this tomb is very fine. The fertile land and the Nile enclosed by the limestone hills of Libya and the bian mountains in the distanoe form a quiet 'but by no means tonous setting for the beautiful town of Assiiit with its eleven rets and its environment of palm-gardens. The new is still grander from the higher tombs. The second cbamber of this tomb is covered with important inscriptions. To the right on entering, is one of 64 lines, whioh oannot be read without the aid of a long ladder and a good 
lantern. It contains ten artioles from the code relating to the worship of the dead, determining, amongst other things, tbe sacrificial gifts for the statues of the deceased.

Higher up, to the right (N.), is a row of three tombs close to each other, the northernmost of which has been destroyed. The 8econd is the KaJar t&-'A.akir, or Soldiers' Tomb, 80 named from the rows of warriors on its S. wall. On the right side of this tomb is a long and partly elraced inscription, referring not only to Kheli, father of Tef ib, the owner of the tomb, but also to King Merihra (12th Dyn., ace. to Maspero, of the 10th or Heracleopolitan Dyn.), ill whose reign Kheti lived. The adjoining tomb (to the left or S.; No. S) contains a long scription referring to Tefab, a high-priest of Apheru (AnubiS), lord of Assit1t. A little farther to the S. is the tomb (No.2) of other I!ap-Zt(a, son of Ai and headman of the district of Atef-khent. The geological formation of this hill of tombs is very interesting, especially on account of the numerous speCimens of Call ....... '.. .ilG'ica and other fossils found On its upper part.

The deity most highly revered here was the crocodile-headed Sebek, the tile sacred to whom was carefully tended in Lake lllreris. At the same time the voracious and dangerous monster, notwithstanding the reverence paid to it on account of its connection with the inundation, waa also regarded as Tnlhonic, and the Crocodilopolitan nome was therefore passed over in'the lists of nomes. -At the period preceding that of the Psamtikides of the 26th Dynaaty the Labyrinth appears to have been used as a hall for great imperial assemblies. At the period of the Piolemies and the Romans the products of the Faydm were much e][tolled. 'The ArsinoUe Nome', says Strabo, 'is the most remarkable of all, both on count of its seenery and its fertility and cultivation. For it alone is planted with large, full-grown, and richly productive olive-trees, and the oil is good when carefully prepared; those who are neglectful may deed obtain oil in abundance, but it has a bad smell. In the rest of Egypt the olive-tree is never seen, e][cept in the gardens of Alexandria, where under favourable circumstances they yield olives, but no oil. Vines, corn, podded plants, and many other products also thrive in thie district in no small abundance'. -Strabo's description is still applicable at the present day. The oranges and mandarins, peaches, olives, Jigs, cactus fruit, pomegranates, and grapes grown here are much esteemed, and the beautiful, rich-coloured red roses of the gardens of the Fayo.m, which were once 80 lavishly strewn at the banquets of Cleopatra, still thrive here. At the station of llledinet el-Faylbn small phials of attar of rOS68, of inferior quality, are frequently oft'ered for sale. Isma'il Pasha devoted special attention to this favoured part of his dominions. The Jields, which are watered by means of wheels of peculiar construction, yield rice, 8ugar, cotton, flu, and hemp, besides the usual cereals. The beginning of vember is probably the seaaon at which the traveller will obtain the most distinct idea of the fertile character of the district. -The 1""06(1tJ .. " are fellAhin, or tillers of the soil, and Beduins. To the latter race long the 'poor Jlshermen who inhabit the banks of the Birket el-,uro.n. lIany of the peasants also call themselves 'Arabs', and the wealthier of them are generally well mounted.

Between the station and the town we observe a peculiar, undershot slpyeh, ·or water-wheel driven by the water itself. The very long covered bazaar contains nothing of special interest. The traveller, even if unprovided with an introduction, should pay a visit to the mudtr, who will protect him from extortion in case of any difficulty with the owners of horses and others C compo p. 34). A broad arm of the Bal}.r Yusuf (p. 35) fiows through the middle of the town. The mosque of /{ait Bey, on the N. side of the town, now somewhat dilapidated, is the only interesting building of the kind. It contains numerous antique columns, brought from the ancient Arsinoe, some of which have shafts of polished marble with Arabic inscriptions, and Corinthian and other capitals. Below the mosque, on the bank of the Bal}.r Y usuf, are some remains of ancient masonry. No ancient inscriptions have been discovered here, but the waUs of some of the houses contain fragments which must have belonged to ancient temples. At the W. end of the town the Bal}.r Yftsuf radiates into numerous branches, which water the country in every direotion. The dilapidated mosque of lJofi situated here forms a picturesque foreground. To theN. of the town are the extensive ruins of Arlinoi, whieh has been entirely destroyed. The site is now called K6m Fari,. Many antiquities, both of the Roman and the Christian period, have been found here, including numerous small terracotta lamps and many thousand fragments of papyri, intermixed with pieces of parchmem.· Most of the papyri are Greek C among them fragments of Homer, Euripides, Thucydides, also of a Christian catechetical book), many are Arabic from the 2nd cent. of the gira down to 943 A.D.; and others are in Coptic, Pehlevi, nide-Persian, and Meroitic-Ethiopian charaoters. Several fragments in hieratio and hieroglyphic oharacters, the oldest from the time of Ramses III. (about 1300 B.C.), have also been discovered. As the writings are for the most part t8ll-papers, it has been supposed that they belonged to a tax offtce of the town of Crocodilopolis, where old papyri also were used. A large number of the papyri found here were acquired by Consul Travers for the Berlin Museum, and even a larger number by Theod. Graf and Arohduke ·Rainer for the Austrian Museum of Art and Industry at Vienna. The very sive cemetery of the town, with its picturesque tombstones, covers part of the site of the ancient oity; the highest of the mounds of rubbish command a survey of the whole of the Fayftm. At the N. end of the ruins, about 11/, M. from Medineh, M. Schweinfurth discovered the remains of a large temple witb a. pylon, in front of which is a sitting figure of Amenemha I., the founder of the 12th Dyn., and inside several slabs with the name of Ramses the Great.

It stlll coatain. some shapeless ruins of ancient origin, destitute of inscription, but posed to be the remains of the pyramids which according to Herodotus once stood in the lake. They are now called Kur,; or chair of Pharaoh, and resemble dtlapidated altars rising above other fragments of solid masonry. If they were once pyramids, the greater part of them must have been removed, as the walls are now but slightly inclined inwards. Distinct traces of the water in which they once stood are to be seen on their bases, and they are 8till surrounded by remains of walls, the purpose of which is unknown. In the fields near Ehglg, or Bellig, 21/0 M. to the S. W. of Medineh, lies a fine obelisk, broken into two parts, whieh must have once been at least 46 ft. in height (route to it rough and dirty). Like other obelisks, it is, horizontally, of oblong rectangular shape, and its summit is rounded. The inscriptions, which are damaged at many places, inform us that the monument was erected _by Usertesen I., who also founded the obelisk of Heliopolis (Vol. L, p. 883), and belonged to the same family (12th Dyn.) as Amenemha III., tile founder of the Labyrinth. -A visit to Bihamu and Ebgtg is chiefiy interesting to arch8!ologists, and perhaps to bots· nists also. EXOull.SIONS. A whole day i8 required for a visit to the Pyramid of Haw8f'ah and the Labyrinth (horse 10, donkey I) fr.). The route leads at llrst for 3/, hr. along the bank of the BaJ.tr Yilsut.

The corn and cotton llelds are sbaded by numerous sycamores, lebbeks, palms, and other trees. About 1/2 hr. from Uhifeh, and beyond two smaller villages, we reach a bridge of ancient brick masonry. Traversing the sligbtly undulating tract a little farther, we reach tbe Bel8 M8 ('river without water'), also called el-Bats, a deep nel, extending in a wide curve, and terminating near the N.E. end of the Birket el-I5-urdn (p. 48). In winter the water, which les down from its lofty banks, forms a few scanty pools. At the bottom of the channel grow reeds and tamarisks. The S. bank rises at places nearly perpendicularly to a beight of 26 ft., so that the sequenoe of the strata of the soil is distinotly observable. We now ascend the plateau (the highest in the provinee, 88 It. above the sea level) on whioh lies Hawiret ...

FayUm. LABYRINTH. 2. Route. 39 thus reach the structure, which consists of a terrall8 of six carefully jointed steps of large and well-hewn blocks, but bears no inscription whatever. We cross the d-Wardan, which now intersects the ruins near the Pyramid of Hawlrah, and which is sometimes called by the Arabs el-Melekh or i.e. river of the East. On the E. side lies the mass of buildings, which, a41cording to Lepsius, was probably the Labyrinth (s8e lOW). In order to obtain a survey of these interesting ruins the traveller is recommended to ascend at onll8 the Pyramid of wf.ra. This consists of unburnt bricks of Nile mud mixed with straw (Vol. I., p. 370), and, when its sides were perfect, covered an area of upwards of {16 sq. yards. It has been aSll8rtained that the eleus of the structure is a natural mass ofrock, 39 ft. in height. The dilapidated summit is easily reached in a few minutes by a tlight of well-worn steps. The entranll8 to the pyramid, on the S. Side, was discovered in 1889 by Mr. Flinders Petrie. 'rhe tomb chamber is 22 ft. long, 8 ft. Wide, and 6 ft. high; it was covered with three large slabs of stone and contained two sarcophagi, one of them of polished sandstone without inscription, and fragments of an baster vase with the name of Amenemha III. The chamb8r was fllled with water to a depth of 3 ft. Towards the S. we observe a congeries of chambers and passages of unburnt bricks, bounded by the Bal)r esh-Sherp, and pronoullced by Lepsius to be the right side of the Labyrinth, and the only part of it which is to some extent preserved. On the other side of the Pyramid there was doubtless a similar collection of rooms which has 'lOW disappeared; and several oiher structures beyond them, of which traces still remain, must have once existed there. The whole rinth must have been in the shape of a horseshoe. Between the wing of the Labyrinth which still exists, and that which has disappeared, lies an extensive space strewn with broken pottery, in the middle of which are large fragments of a magnificent ancient temple. The base of the shaft of a small papyrus column, and a capital of the same order, both in the red stone of Assuin, with sculptured stalks and foliage, are worthy of notice. Some blocks disinterred here bearing the name of Amenemha III. have again been covered with sand. Several large blocks of limestone are also observed in the middle of this large court of the Labyrinth. The inscriptions are almost tirely destroyed, but faint traces of painting, and the symbols qc;:> (la) and (u), are still recognisable. From the traces still iating, the whole structure would appear to have occupied an area of 8800 sq. yds., and the large inner court an area of about 60 acres. The Ancient Labyrinth.

40 Bouu2. LABYRINTH. FayUm. rinUl, whic:h was afterwards reckoned as 'one of the wonders of Ule world', was so vast as to surp&88 all the buildings of the Greeks taken together and even the Pyramids themselves. For the best description we are indeMed to Strabo, who visited Ule LabyrinUl in person. He says: 'There is also the Labyrinth here, a work as important as the Pyr&mids, adjoining which is Ule tomb of the king who built the rinth. After advancing about SO-4O stadia beyond the IIrst entrance of the canal, there is a table-shaped suriace, on which rise a sm&ll town and a.vast palace, consisting of as many royal dwellings as tbere were formerly nomes. There is also an equal number of halls, bordered wiUl columns and adjoining each other, all being in the s&me row, and ing one building, like a long wall having the balls in front of it. Tbe entrances to the halls are opposite the wall. In front of the entrances are long and numerous passages which bave winding paths runuing tbrough them, so tbat tbe ingress and egress to each half is not practicable to a stranger wiUlout a guide. It is a marvellous fact that each of the ceilings of the ch&mbers consists of a single stone, and al80 that the passages are covered in the s&me way wiUl single slaba of extraordinary size, neither wood nor other building material baving been. employed. On ascending tbe roof, the heigbt of whicb is siderable, as there is only one story, we observe a atone surface sisting of large slahs. Descending again, and looking into the b&lls, we may observe tbe whole borne by twenty-seven monolithic columus. The walls also are constructed of stones of similar size. At tbe end of this structure, whic:h is more than a stadium in length, is Ule tomb, ing of a square pyramid, eacb side of wbich is four plethra (400 ft.) in length. and of equal height. The deceased, who is buried bere, is called Ismandes. It is also asserted that 80 many palaces were built, because it was the custom for all the nomes, represented by their magnates, witb tbeir priests and victims, to assemble bere to olfer saeril1ce and gifts to the gods, and. to deliberate on the most important concerns. Eaeb nome then took possession of Ule hall destined for it. Bailing about a hundred stadia beyond this point, we next reacb Ule town of Amnoe', eto. This d.scription of Strabo is eonlIrmed by the contents of two papyri, one of wbich is in the musenm of Gi.eh, the other in private pos.eo.ion (Mr. Hood). The deities of 66 districts are enumerated here,. 24 of whom long to Upper Egypt, 20 to Lower Egypt, and 22 to the Fa.ydm. It is very doubtful whether we should consider these buildings of Nile bricks as remains of the ancient Labyrinth, or rather as tombs, Certainly nothing is left that recalls in any way the dour of the old 'wonder of the world', Except some blocks of stone, nothing remaills of the extensive structures once erected here, save the pyramid 'at the end of the labyrinth', To the N. of the pyramid Mr. Flinders Petrie discovered Some mummy coffins with carefully painted beed. (now in London). Of still greater value are the portraits found at ,'-Bub","t, 18 M. to the N .B. of dinet el-Fayum, wblch were purchued and brought to Europe by JI, dore Graf. Lake ... ria. The object of Lake :llreria, which ba. long aince been dried up, was to receive Ule superfluous water in Ule case of too high an inundation, and to di8tribute its contents over Ule fields when the overRow was in8uflIcient, Strabo de.cribes Lake Jlreris in the ing terms: 'Owing to its size and deptb It is capable of receiving tbe superabundaDce of water during Ule inundation, without overflowing the habitations and crops j but later, wben the water subsides, and after the lake has given up its excess througb one of Its two mouths, both it and the canal retain water enonglt for purp"ses of irrigation. This is pliRhed by natural means, but at both end. of the canal there are also lock-gates, by means of wbich the engineers can regulate tbe inRul< and effll1l< of the water.'

The following routes are all practicable, but the third i8 to be preferred: -(1) We proceed by land vii. Ner.leh (where boats must be ordered for the passage of the lake) to {(urUn; then by water to Dlmeh, and again by water to the S. bank of the lake, situated in the latitude of lJenh().r, which lies about 4 M. inland. The horses should be sent on from J}urtin to the lake (unless the what refractory guides refuse to obey), in order that we may ride to and thence to Medinet el-Fayftm. Four or live days are required for the excursion j the points of interest are mentioned in the third route. The road from Nezleh (see below) to J}nrtln (4 hrs. ) leads through the desert, past the remains of a small temple, called by the Arabs el-Benat, or 'Maidens' Castle'.

Here, as in most of Egypt, large quantities of pigeons are kept by the peasants, chiefly for the sake of their droppings, which form the only manure used in the fields, the dung of the cattle being dried and used as fuel. Large pigeon-houses, not unlike pylons, are visible in all the villages, and huge 1I.0cks of pigeons are seen wheeling in the air or settling like a dark cloud on the lI.elda. MOlt of these pigeons are of the common grey speciel, and attain a siderable size, but many pretty little reddish-grey turtle doves are also seen. The traveller is at liberty to shoot these birds, which in the form of a pigeon-pie with olives form a most acceptable tion to his larder, but he should exercise this liberty with discretion and not rob the harmless fella\t of too many ofhls feathered friends. The pigeons really consume more than they produce, so that their encouragement by the fella\tin is rightiy regarded as a serious mistake in their husbandry. Those who are interested in Egyptian agriculture may utilise the opportunity of an unfavourable wind to go ashore here. merly convent after convent occupied this district, and the gardens of the monks, according to Ma1,trizi, made it possible for the veller to walk continually in the shade.

The few insoriptions refer to the old empire. Stamped bricks found in the lIlounds of debris belonged to the buildings of the 18th nasty. The quarries contain ornaments and representations of the Roman period. el-Kebir stands on the site of the ancient AfttlZopoUa, capital of the Antmopolitan nome, in which the hero Antams and other deities were worshipped. An inscription found here reads: AV"ta.[CI) "l'.a.t 'to Antmus and his divine colleagues'. In ancient Egyptian it was called the 'Nome of the two Gods', probably in commemoration of the contest tween Seth and Horus. According to the myth Antmus, son of Poseidon and Gma, was a giant of immense strength, whom Osiris, on his journey through the world to introduce the vine and the culture of graiu, appointed his vicegerent over the land bordering on Ethiopia and Libya. Busiris was governor of the land to the E. Antmus used his giant's strength to overcome and slay strangers, and Hercules had to try conclusions with him when he lauded iu Libya to steal the cattle of Geryon; After a violent struggle, cules succeeded in strangling his huge opponent. The deciding contest between Typhon (Seth) and Osiris, or rather Horus, son and representative of Osiris, took place, according to the version of the legend adopted by Diodorns, at Antmopolis, although the scriptions, and notably the great Horus text of Edfu, relate that the struggle raged from one end of the Nile valley to the other. The Egyptian name of was Ll Jr : Tu ka, or 'town of the lofty mountain', whenee is derived the Coptic Tkou. It was also known as Zez.

At the beginning of the present century an interesting temple stood on the site of the old town of which the last column was washed away by the Nile in 1821. Jomard, who described thi. temple during the French Expedition, when the water already lapped its 
foundations, foretold ita fate. The temple was dedicated by Ptolemy Philometor and his wife Cleopatra to Antreus and was restored by JIlarcus Aurelius Antoninua and his colleague Verus (1M A.D.). This information was conveyed by a double inscription, in Greek and in hieroglyphics, over the portal. The bulls of the hieroglyphic inscription (Kdu) probably denoted the name of the town. The temple was built of limestone and was at least 226 ft. long, 52 ft. wide, and 51 ft. high. Its entrance faced the river. The 18 columns which were arranged in S rows, were 87 ft. high, with a diameter of <n'l_ ft., and ended in palm-leaf capitalB. If the gigantic blocks that J omard found on the ground were really parts of the oeiling, they exceeded in size those of Karnak, which now excite our astonishment. One of them was 32 ft. long, 4,Bf. ft. high, and 51/. ft. thick, and must have weig)led at least 48 tons.

The Cat'Ull of 80h8g, which leads hence to Assiftt, keeps to the W. and is intended to convey the water of the rising Nile as far as possible towards the Libyan Desert. On tbls canal lies Ell'" (I/fu), the ancient Apllrodi/opoli., so named from the sandals (teb) made out of the skin of Seti. About 2 H. from EUeh is the Red Oonvent, ])it-d-A(lmar, also called Dir Abu BiohM. Those who wish to visit the Red Convent and the similar White Convent (one of the regular excursions of the passengers by the 'four weeks' steamer) may hire asses at Sohag and ride via »emoll towards the Libyan Desert. The old church of the convent, a basilica with nave and aisles, is a very ancient strncture of brick, with elaborate capitals and a richly articulated apse. The outer walls, decreasing in thickness towards the tOPt and the COncave cornice above the portal, are interesting forlthelr remintscence of ancient Egyptian art. Abu Bishii, the founder of the convent, is said by Wansleb to have been a penitent robber, and he afterwards acquired such a reputation for sanctity that, according to Hakrizi, SOOO monks placed themselves under his care. The recluse after whom the White Oonvent (Dif' .I-Ab,la4 or De,' Abu Shan6di) was named, is stated to have been one of his pupils. It lies at the foot of the mountains, farther to the S.E., and may perhaps be rather called a Christian village than a convent, as husbands, wives, and children live here in families. The walls of the church are bnilt of heWD stone, probably taken from the adjacent ruins of A/,.""/)Io .J.Iamed), dating from the Ptolemaic and Roman perial periods. It dates at latest from the lith cent. and is a basilica with nave and aisles. The columns vary in height and thickness, and the capitals are partly of later date. The chancel ends in three vaulted apses. The cupolas are adorned with poor frescoes, and the other decoration. are also wretched. -In the hills to the W. of the White Convent are a few late rock-tombs, one of which, according to the inscription, is that of Ermiu., SOn of Archibius. 6tj2 M. Akhmtm, a steamboat and mail station on the E. bank, also reached from SoMg by a shorter land-route, is a thriving little town with about 10,000 inhab., including 10000hristians, some of whom are Roman Oatholics, with a chapel of their own. The weekly mArket on Wed. is much frequented, and the bazaar is stocked. The numerous cotton mills produce the cloth for the blue shirts of the fellA\lin and for the long s1iala (pI. sh8Mt), or shawls with fringes, which the poorer classes wear on state occasions and for protection against cold. These articles, which have been made here since the time of Strabo, are extraordinarily cheap. Akhmtm stands on the site of Khemmis or PanopoZi8, generally held to be the most ancient town on the Nile, though this honour probably belongs to the venerable This-Abydos, on the W. bank (p. 53). The deity specially venerated here was the form of Ammon Generator known as Ammon Khem, also called at a later date Min, an appellation formed by dropping the Khem and abbreviating the Amen. Thus it is called III-I'll;, i.e. belonging to Min. For a 1\gure of this deity, who appears in the most ancient texts, see Baedeker's Lower Egypt, p.137. Diodorus, who among other classical writers gives us much information about Khemmis-Panopolis, calls it XEII-II-W, whence proceed the Coptic 8hmin and the Arabic Ekhmtm or Akhmlm. Its profane name on the monuments is Apu.

A statue of him stood in the temple. From time to time the hero revisited Khemmis, leaving, as a sign of his presence, his sandals, which were two ells long; the finding of these was slderad a podent of good fortune. The festival of pole-climbing, ted in honour of Khem, probably luggested his Identification with the Greek Pan. -It Is obvious that Perseus has been confused with Horus, Ł the destroyer of Typhon·8eth. Among the various forms assumed by the 'Libyan )lonster' in his long battle with Horus was that of a dragon or serpent, while Horus, like Perseus, was supported by wings in his counter; hence the mistake of Herodotus. In any case he is excusable for seeking in Egypt the home of Perseus, whose genealogy may be traced back to 10. t It is an interesting fact that a later author states that the Persea tree was first planted in Enp& by Perseus. As no goat-footed deities have been so far discovered in the EgypUan cult, it is somewhat difficult to explain how Khem came to be identified with Pan, unless on account of his Priapian characteristics. The Pans and satyrs at Khemmis first received and disseminated the news of the death of OsiriS, and hence, says Plutarcb, the sudden dread and confusiou of a multituae is callea panic. Akhmim is thus the true home of Panic F,al'. A white bull and a black cow were sacred to Khem. He appears in the triad along with the child Horus and Isis Sekhet, surnamed t-erpa (trepha), whence the Greeks may have formed the name Triphis. Tryph8!na was also a cognomen of some of the queens of the Pwlemaic line. Khemmis still ftourished in the Roman period, and its ancient and famous temple was ftnally completed in the 12th year ofTrajan. After Ohristianity established itself here, the vicinity of Panopolis became crowded with convents. Nestorius, Bishop of ople, who had been banished to the oasis of Hibeh (KhArgeh, Egypt. Heb, p. 302) on account of his disbelief in the divine motherhood of the Virgin Mary, was attacked there by the ing Blemmyes, and carried captive into the Thebaid, .where he surrendered himself to the prefect of Panopolis, to avoid a charge of wilful ftight. He died in Panopolis-Akhmim. Even after the conquest of Egypt by IsUm, the temple of the 'great town' of Akhmtm was, as AbuUeda and other Arabs relate, among the most important remains of the days of the Pharaohs. Edrisi gives the following account of it: 'At Akhmim we see the building called the Barba (i.e. Perpa, Coptic for temple), which the ftrst Hermes erected before the flood ...ŁŁ (of many ancient temples) that of Akhmtm is the most enduring and also the most remarkable for the beauty of its sculpture. In trutb we ftnd represented in it not a few stars only, but also various arts and artists, along with numerous scriptions. The building lies in tbe midst of Akbmim'.

Of the second temple of Khemmis, which Herodotua describes as dedicated to Perseus, the only maina are a few stones of the 18th Dynasty and some scanty ments of a building of the Ptolemaic and Roman period. These are reached by the water when the Nile overllows its banks and are gradually being swept away. In 1884 lla.pero discovered an extensive Necl"Opoli. adjOining a Coptic monastery among the mountains to the N.E. of Akhmtm. Thousands of mummies have been taken thence and aome of them were sent to Enrope. A viait to thia necropolis is well worth nndertaking. The best plan io to secnre the company of Kkalil-/!QJ:ktJr, keeper of the Egyptian Museum, and ride with him to the N.E., in the direction of the mountaiDs. On a hill beyond the village of (1/. hr.) el-Halt:aiah,1& we see the deserted Coptic monastery, ronnd which, in a wide circle, lie the tomba, now mostly destroyed. They date from the 6th Dynasty (pepiseneb, Khemankhteta, Ankhu, etc.) down to the Greek and Roman period. The grave of Tutu, son of Sit asra (daughter of Osiris), with liturgical inscriptions, is well preserved (188Ii). Most of the mummies found here Were in good vation, and many contained rolls of papyrus. Among them were many priests (it) and priestesses (ah!) of Khem, whose genealogies are carried up for eight or ten generations. The town of Akhmim has now become the seat of an active trade in mummies. Objects of eonsiderable interest and value may often be obtained from the dealers in antiquities, but relic-hunters should not try to make purchases in the presence of the keeper of the museum. Continuing our journey up the Nile, we soon see, close to the E. bank, a conspicuous convent-village, resembling a fortress. On account of its whitewashed walls the sailors call it D6r a name that properly belongs to the monastery mentioned at p. 49, which lies much farther to the W. About 50 men, women, and children occupy the convent, which has little of a religious racter in its mode of life. The pretty little church, built of light and dark brioks, is lighted by cupolas, the largest of which is above the nave. The nave is separated from the aisles by wooden screens. The Hekel, or Holy of Holies, at the E. end, is carefully enclosed. In the nave, below the dome, stands the reading-desk of the priests, and at the W. end of the church, separated from the priests, are the seats for the laity. The paintings are wretched, and there are no old MSS. j but the church is an excellent specimen of a Coptic place of worahip and is worth visiting, especially as it is only I) min. walk from the river.

Its constitution is drawn up in the Hellenic manner'. The Ptolemaic kings who died here received the same honours as the manes ot the Pharaohs at Abydos. According to Leo Africanus Menshtyeh was the seat of an African prince named Hawara. Numerous antiquities have been found here lately. Before we reach Girgeh the monntains on the Arabian bank approach close to the stream. At several points are rock-tombs, either wholly destitute of inscriptions or with none but obliterated specimens. 121/2 M. Girgeh, on the W. bank, is a steamboat-station, with post and telegraph ofllces; the tourist-steamers stop Cor the night here. Girgeh, whioh II SS6 H. from and 296 1(. from AsauBn, haa been {rom time immemorial the station where the Nile-boatmen halt to bake a new supply of bread. As, however, this operation lakes 24. hrs. (a supply for several weeks being necessary), and as Girgeh Is not a venlent place for 10 long a stoppage, the traveUer is advised to make .. contract in Cairo before starting to the eailct that the halt for baking be made at or Keneh and not in Girgeh. No re'is will give up thiB privilege, nnlelB he has been previously bound down to do 80 in writing. The customs of the Nile boatmen are almost as unchangeable as th08e of the desert Arabi. The only suitable way in which to fill up a hali of 2& hrs. at Girgeh would be to make an excursion to the temple of Abydos, but this is much more conveniently reached from Beli8.neh (p. 59). A day can very profitably spent at either or !Feneh, in the laUer case by a visit to the noble temple of Denderah (comp. the Contract at p. xxi). Girgeh, which contains 14,900 inhab., preceded Aseiut a8 the capital of Upper Egypt, but is now merely the chief place in the province of Girgeh, while the seat of the Mudtriyeh is at SaM,; (p. 48). It becomes more probable every day that Girgeh occupies the lite of the ancient Thu (hieroglyph. Teni), in which the god Anhur (Greek Onouris) was specially worshipped (comp. p. 03). Some ancient tombs oC the 6th Dynaaty exist here, including one of the time of Merenptah; and a little to the N. are lIome other graves of the ancient kingdom. Many of the present are Copts. Outside the town lies a Roman Catholic convent, which is probably the oldest but one in Egypt; the abbot is a member of the Fraternity of the Holy Sepulchre. The name of the town is Christian, being that of St. George or Girges, the patron-B&int of the Coptic Christians, a representation of whom, in his combat with the dragon, is present in almost every Coptic chlJrCh.

Memnonium Handeb, they could have found no more ,ullable 8pot for a 8eUIement than the neighbourhood of Abydos, where the fertile W. bank of the Nile expands and offers easy cultivation and excellent dwelling-8ites, removed from all danger of Inundation. This is the most ancient town in Egypt, and it. neighbour Abyd08 cannot have been much younger, for even in the time of the early empire it i. frequently spoken of as a holy city. It possessed the most famous grave of OsiriS, of which it was believed that burial in its vicinity or consecration in its sanctuary went far in ensuring a favourable judgment in the world to come. From an early period the grandees of the land caused their mummies to be brought hither -often, however, for a limited time onlY1 directing that, as soon as the wished-for blessin@s had been received from Osiris, the bodies should be carriad back to their ancestral burial-grounds. lfariette has proved that the town itself (Egypt. Ablu) was never of any great tent. The extant ruins extend from el-Kherbeh on the N.W. to 'Araba! el-)Iadfilneh on the S.E. If, however, Abyd08 was small In the number of its citizens, it was great through the importance of the gods wo .... shipped in its temples. Each of the 42 nomes of Egypt possessed its temple of Osiris; but none of them, except tbat of Sokar in )Iemphis, rivalled in sanctity that of Abydos. The testimony of the monuments 18 confirmed by the classical writers. Herodotus left Upper Egypt scribed, because Hecatreus had already treated of it, but we quote the celebrated passage in which the trustworthy Strabo speaks of Abydos : Ł Above II (Ptolemars) lies Abydos, the site of the N.1IIfIOniUm, a wonderful palace of stone, built in the manner of the Labyrinth, only somewhat less elaborate in its complexity. Below the lIemnonium is a spring, reached by passages with low vaults consisting of a single ,tone and prominent by their axte'lt and mode of construction. Tbl8 spring is connected with the Nile by a canal, whicb flows tbrough a grove of Egyptian tborn-acacias, sacred to Apollo. Abydos seem. once to have been a large city, second only to Thebes, but now it is a small place, etc.' Abydos is also mentioned by Plntarch, Athenreus, Stepbanus of Byzantinm, Ptolemy, Pliny, and other.. Ammianus llarcellinus speak. of the oracle of tbe god Besa, which flourished bere. The ordinary traveller, especially when he haa at his disposal only the 8 hrs. allowed by the steamer, will con fine himself to the Memnonium of Seti I. (PI. I) at 'Arabat el-Madfuneh and the sadly dilapidated Temple of Ramses II. (PI. II). The remains of the so-called Temple of OBiris at ef,..Kherbeh. (PI. III) and the adjacent sitt of Mariette's excavations in the ancient necropolis among the Libyan hills are rapidly becoming less and less interesting through the steady encroachment of the desert sand. The KeJDJl,onium of Beti I. This noble structure, wbicb, from the time of Strabo onwards, haa been visited and described by so many travellers, did not become fnlly known to the modern world till Marlette Bey, with characteristic ment and perseverance and supported by the generosity of the Kh8diTe, began in 181i3 the task of freeing it from tbe sand. His plan of isolating the building by digging a trench round and preventing new lations of sand was not carried wholly into effect, but still, with the ception of portion of the outside of the N. wall of the second court, tbere is now no part of the temple where in ... lptions are likely to be found tbat does not stand open to tbe explorer.

of 8eti I. ABYDOS. 4. Route. 55 of tbe adjoining village, 'Arabat el-Hadfolneb, 1 ŁŁ _ 'Arabat of tbe bnried'. POSBibly the last portion of the name may refer to Osiris, whose grave bere attracted 80 many pilgrims, and Hadfdn (masc.) may be a translalion of tbe old name of the templo-quarter of Abydos. In spite of tbe moot lavisb expenditure of time, money, and labour, tbe excavators failed to find either the spring mentioned by Strabo or the tomb of Osiris, and yet the latter must lie close to tbe part of tbe ruins called K6m .. ·8"/1<1", near the boly hill of Abydos so often mentioned in the inscriptions. Hariette derives the name X .... "o .. i"m from that of its founder Seli Ra-men·ma or Hen·ma·ra. ThiS, however, is undoubtedly wroi5' and was tbe first to show tbat the Egyptlau word X_,,= @. or NWW\, applied to any large monument or memorial, whether architec-000 tural or plastic, led tbe Greeks to describe every palatial structure of the ancient Egyptians as a M.p..G.I ŁŁ (Hemnonion) or palaee of X_o ... Perbaps they first heard the name Hennu given to the colossal figure. of Amenhotep Ill. at Thebes (p. 153) and were attracted by its resemblance in sound to the name of the son of Eos who fell before Troy; hence they called the figures, afterwards so celebrated, statues of Hemnon, and saw Hemnoni&, or palaces of the same hero, in some of the large memorial buildings described as Mennu. The fact that the Hellena. did not apply this name to an the great buildings of Egypt, but only to some of the temples of W. Thebes and to the sanctuary of Setl at Abydos, may be esplained by the supposilion that in the time of the Pharaohs these ings monopolised the epithet of Hennu, just as the fortress of the queror in London is known as the 1'ower par .., ŁŁ ,"""'. among the numerous towers of that city. The temple of Seti became known as the Memnonium or Palace of lIIemnon in the Alexandrine period and a natural consequence was the conversion of the name Abtu into the larly sounding Abtldo8 or Ab,ldu8, tbe name of a town of Troas on the Hellespont, not far from tbe burial-place of Hemnon. By degrees the Asiatic hero, son of Tithonus and Eos and aliy of Priam (comp. p. 1M), wag converted into an Ethiopian, and the lively imagination of tne Greeks transferred the Asiatic legends to Egypt and adapted them to Egyptian condition.. Thus they related that Tithonus sent an Ethiopian army to aid bis son against Troy. The.e soldiers, however, heard of the death of Jlemnon at Abydos in Upper Egypt and retraced their steps, after ing their garlands on tbe aeaeias in the holy grove at the Memnonium. Birds were fabled to have sprung from the ashes of HemDon, and peared on certain days every year, removed all impurities from his grave, dipped their wings in the Ae,op08, which fiows into the Propontis at zicua, and sprinkled the grave witb the water. At a later date these birds were said to come from Ethiopia. Finally it was a.serted that the tian Abydos had been founded by colonists from its Asiatic name.ake. The Memnonium of Abydos is not an ordinary divine or religious temple like those of Denderah, Karnak, aud Edfu, but is rather one of the aeries of sepulchral sanctuaries of which mention is made at p. 170 of Baedeker', Lower Egypt. The numerous representations and inscriptions th&t cover its walls are mostly of a very general nature. They tell us, however, that the building they adorn was primarily intended for funereal purposes. As already mentioned, the bodies of numerous priMes and grandees were brought here to participate in the blessings that were supposed to emanaie from the sallred tomb of Osiris. The Pharaohs nowhere offered sacrifices to the manes of their forefathers more gladly than at Abydos, and prayers were put up here to the OsiriS-kings of the aJ)@ient hquse DigitIZed by uoogle

A row of 1'2 limestone columns stand a short stance in advance of the temple wall, forming with it a kind of pronaos. In the time of Seti seven doors, corresponding to the seven ohambers of the sanctuary C see below), pierced the rear-wall, whioh was adorned with a cornice of its own. On ceremonial oocasions the processions in honour of the king seem to have entered by the door to the extreme left; the next served for processions to Ptah, the third for Harmachis, the fourth for Ammon, the fifth for Osiris, the sixth for Isis, and the seventh for Horus. Ramses, however, walled up six of these doors, leaving the central one alone, the decoration of whioh had been begun by Setl, as the main entrance to the temple. A small door in the Horus gateway, to the extreme right, is still open. The pillars bear huge figured representations and a few insoriptions, which refer to Seti I. as deceased and duce Ramses II. in the company of Ammon-Ra, Osiris, Horus, and other gods. The hieroglyphics inform us that Ramses erected this part of the temple in honour of his father, one phrase, for instance, reading: 'The king of Upper aud Lower Egypt, the Lord of the Barbarians (Nine Nations), to make great the name of his father'. The entranoe-wall behind the pillars oonfirms this pious filial wish beyond the shadow of a doubt. In the wall, to the left of the main entrance, is " large and couspiouous inSCription in 95 verticallines, whioh, after the lists of kings, must be called the most important in Abydos. It oonsists of two parts. In the first Ramses relates how, on coming to Abydos, he found his father's work unfinished and resolved to carry it to a conolusion. The grandees rejoiced at this resolution, and workmen and artists of every kind were moned to aid in the task. In the seoond part Pharaoh recalls to his consciousness all the honours he had paid and the gifts he had presented to his father. The gods show him favour on account of his pious acts and advance, one by one, to bestow upon him the riohest gifts of heaven: strength, fearlessness, victory, immortality, ete. A picture aooompanying the inscription represents Ramses, with a crown on his head, offering sacrifices to the goddess Ma and to a triad consisting of Osiris, Isis. and his father Seti I., who takes the place of Horus. Recently deceased, Seti' appears as the youthful god, the victorious opponent of the might of Death, who will soon become Osiris, after subduing all his enemies beneath his feet. On one of the pillars, indeed, Seti is already described as the 'royal Osiris'. The inscription dates from the first year of the single rule of Ramses and from the time of his first journey to Thebes, when he erected statues of his father in the oity of Ammon and in Memphis. At Abydos he first undertook the restoration of his father's monumental structures in the neoropolis, on the spot speoially sacred to Osiris Unnefer.

The columns had not ,et been plaoed upon their bases, the statue lay on the ground and was not yet finished off, when he (Seti) became aoquainted with the tomb (the 'golden room', the principal chamber of Seti's tomb at Bibb el-Mulftk), etc. Then said His Majesty to the bearer by his side: Summon the courtiers, the military commanders, and their fellows, and also the whole multitude of arohitects and librarians. When these were conducted before His Hajesty, pressing their noses in the dust and their knees to the earth, they broke out into rejoicing and smelled the ground (i.e. prostrated themselves). They raised theu arms, praising His Majesty, and prayed to this benignant deity, celebrating his perfection'. Then follow emphatic expressions of worship, addressed to the king. 'Then spoke His Majesty unto them and said: 1 summoned you before me on account of a plan that has entered my mind. 1 have seen the buildings of the necropolis aud the tombs that are at Abydos, and also those who have to work there. Truly nothing has been restored since the time of their lord unto the present day. But when a son finds self on the throne of his father, shall he not renew the monument (Mennu) of his begetter? . ..

The rest of the inscription assumes more and more the character of a hymn, like those mentioned at p. 258 and elsewhere. The above will sumce to show the filial piety, with which Ramses, at least in the earlier part of his reign, strove to complete and store the work of his father. But the remains of the building structed by him near the Temple of Seti at Abydos (p. 67) prove that he also founded a large Memnonium for himself in the district sanctified by the tomb of Osiris. INTBRIOR OP THB TBKPLB. 1. The Hypostyle Halls and the Sevenfold Sanctuary. From the Pronaos, containing the above inscription, two doors only now lead into the interior of the temple: the main entrance in the middle and a narrow door to the extreme right. The Firat Hypo8tyle Room (Pl. C), a long but narrow apartment, makes a solemn and imposing impression. The roof, part of which has fallen in, is supported by 24 columns, arranged in two rows and in groups of four. The slender shafts are surmounted by capitals in . the form of papyrus buds. Seti I. did not complete the plastic de-coration of the room. Ramses began new sculptures instead olthose begun by his father, apparently forgetting the great filial piety he arrogates to himself in the above-quoted inscription (p. 58). Whether it was that the zeal of the son abated along with his grief for his father, or that the priestly sculptors thought it better to brate a living prince rather than a dead one, the fact remains that it is Ramses alone who is here depicted aud the temple itself is simply called the temple of Abydos, not, as in the earlier tions, that of Ra-ma-men (i.e. Seti). The sculptures preserved here are of mediocre workmanship, and the inscriptions and tations, almost wholly dealing with Ramses and his reception of gifts from the different gods, are generally uninteresting even for the scholar. On the right wall, near the second chamber, is a series of gods, consisting of Ra, Shu (the giver of all delight) and his sister Tefnut (giver of health), Seb (giver of life and strength), 03iri3, Honu (giver of every victory), 1313 (giver of life and strength), the great god Aphem (Anubis), and Nut, who imparts the fulness of salvation. -The six lists of the nomes of Egypt, on the lower part of the walls, are also interesting. As elsewhere, the districts are represented as bearded male figures with the emblem of the nome (a piece of surveyed ground, 3lH:I:) and a standard bearing the symbol of the spedal distrir.t.

I. gan it and his artists exeouted both the architectural details and the plastic adornment with the carefulness and purity of style that marks all their work. 1'he son has here left unchauged the name of the father, which occurs at every point. Three rows of twelve columns each support the architrave, on which rest the roofing slabs, and are arranged in six groups, each of six columns. tween the groups access is afforded to the vaulted ehambers in the wall faeing us as we enter. The first two of the three rows of 001-ums have papyrus-bud capitals. Beyond the second row the fioor of the temple is considerably raised, forming a platform from which the vaulted chambers are entered. Upon this platform stands the third row of columns, the cylindrical shafta of whioh are entirely destitute of capitals, but bear huge blocks of stone forming an cus for the support of the architrave. This peouliarity is simply plained by the fact that the columns in the tllird row are shorter than the others, owing to their raised platform, so that the architeot, by omitting the capitai, brings the abaous of all on the same level and avoids the unpleasant effect which different elevations of the architrave would make on the eye. When processions of worshippers filed in and out, performing pious ceremonies, this hall must have preseuted a very imposing spectacle. Inscriptions below the ings leading from tIle first hall to the second inform us they were formerly filled with doors of bronze (asem). The inscriptions and representations on the walls and columns repeat themselves somely and are of little general interest. Here we see the king ceiving from the gods such attributes of the royal dignity as the crooked sword or the scourge and crook (symbols, perhaps, of the royal duties of incentive on the one side and restraint on tbe other); there we behold him offering burnt-offerings to a single god, a triad, or a group of gods. If the king is receiving gifts, he is generally represented on his knees; when he sacrifices, he leans slightly forward, holding the burnt-offering in the left hand and libations in the right. Sometimes he is seated, receiving the ings of the gods; he appears thus in the fine picture on the N. WaU of the second room, with Isis, Amenti, and Nephthys in front, and the goddess Ma and Renpet behind. His proftle is evidently a ful likeness and is everywhere portrayed with great arUstic skill.

The framework of each scene, the mouldings separating the lines of hieroglyphics, and the hieroglyphio symbols themselves are all executed with imitable care. The side-walls of this hall, to the right and left, and the walls near the gates leading to the chapels, bear symbolic presentations, like those in the 1I.rst hall, of the nomes of Upper and Lower Egypt. At a considerable interval, beyond the third row of columns in the second hall, and on the same level with them, is a series of SBVBN VAULTED CHAMBBRS or CHAl'ELS, forming the Sanctuary of the Memnonium. The metal doors with which they were once closed have long since disappeared. In the piers separating the doors are rectangular niches; which probably contained images either of the deities to whom the chapels were dedicated or of 
King Seti. Each chapel is vaulted and the vanlts are profusely and beantifnlly corated with stars and the name Ra-ma-men (prrenomen of Set! I.). Dedicatory inscriptions on three of the vaults prove that Osiris must be regarded as the chief divinity of the temple. It must be noted that the roofs of these chapels are not vaulted in the strict teetural signification of that word; they consist rather of blocks of stone cut in a rOllnd fashion and crowned by a key-stone which is hollowed out in the interior. The chapels were dedicated ing from the left) to the king, Ptah, Harmachis, Ammon, Osiris, Isis, and Horus. AU the chief figures in the Osiris cycle of gods are represented here with the exception of Seth, the antagonist of Osiris, and his wife Nephthys. With them is associated the king who has become Osiris (see p. 07). Ptah, who becomes Sokar-Osiris when regarded in his relations to life beyond the grave, is of course presented. In the place of honour in the midst of the seven is mon, 'who is the only one and whose years tlourish among the gods', who is 'loftier in his ideas than any other god', 'to whose feet the gods crawl, recognising their lord and master', who is 'lord of eternity and creator of the unending', of whom indeed the other gods may be regarded as attributes. To the right and left of mon are two groups of three. To the right are Osiris, Isis, and rus; to the left are Ptah the prim81val, the lord of the past; machis, who announces the new day rising in the East, who gles for the vietory of life over death, and assures the future triumph of good over evil; and King Seti, the temporal inearnation of divine power in the present, in the sphere of human activity. -To these gods, conceived as filling these chapels with their sence, 'Were brought the mummies, to be sanctified for their eternal home. The way to the different chapels was indicated on the very threshold of the temple, where Seti I., as we have seen, constructed seven doors in the rear-wall of the pronaos. Most of these, over, were closed by Ramses, probably to intensify and preserve the secret and mysterious character of the temple. But thHaths the DigitIZed by\.50og1e ...

ABYDOI!I. different cbapels are still easily distinguisbable, partly from the plan of tbe building, partly by tbe representations and inscriptions ; for from each of the seven doors a processional approach led through the two hypostyle balls straight to tho entrance of the ing chapel; while the representations on the columns llanking each approach refer only to the deity to whom tbe chapel at the end orit was dedicated. In the vaulted chapels, amid the fumes of cense and the murmuring of mumed singing, waited the tering priests of tbe sanctuary, pouring out libations and uttering benedictions as the processions wound along the aisles, either bearing a mummy to be sanctilled or consisting of a group of leged laymen bringing offerings to the Osiris gods for the BOuI'S welfare of the deceased. -The dedications are inscribed on the door-posts in tbe traditional forms and with little variation. Similar vaults occur at Benil}.asan and Der el-Bal}.ri, and also in the lids of the sarcophagi in the museum at Gizeh. In each case the ments to wbich they belong serve funerary purposes; the shape oj the vault is, however, intended to represent the vault of heaven, which the Osiris-soul has to traverse, and they are usually decorated with stars. An inscription preserved on one of the vaults of the sanctuary informs us that the Pharaoh erected this stmcture for his father Osiris in the interior of the temple of Ra-ma-men and lltted up the chapel to resemble the heaven of the ninefold deities, tating its constellations, etc. The internallltting up and appearance of the chapels vary little. As the middle place had to be asslgued to Ammon, the chief of theJods, It was necessary to mark the special diguity of Osiris, to whom inde the temple was consecrated, by making his chapel (Pl. d) wider than the other Ł. The rear-wall. of the latter are, in each case, occupied by two niches with a lotus-flower between them, from which rises the slender form 01 OSiris, symbolising the blossoming of the soul in a 'happier sphere·. In the wall of the aanctuary of O.iris, however, is a door, leading to a .tructure (Pl. E) which, including the adjOining smaller columned chambe .. , is as wide as the whole sanctuary. This was the scene of the mysterious rites brated in honour of the Divine-Deceased (OsiriS, whose name even the Greek Herodotus shrank from breathing) by the esoteric priests of the highest clus (see Baedok.,.', Low.,. EVlIpl, p. 124). The inscriptions in the chapels inform us that the priestly processionst, which came from all parts of the kingdom, made a complete circuit of the chapel, keeping to the right wall on entering and returning to the door along the left wall. Thirty-six rites Or ceremonies had to be performed during this circuit. First came a recitation to prove the worthiness of the worshipper to approach the holy place and the image of the god. Then the veil was lifted. The worshipper w .. next allowed to witness the iuvestiture of the god by the priests with his fillets, garments, ornaments, and the attributes of his divine rower. Not before this was accomplished did the pilgrim prostrate himsel in adoration, bringing olTerings, libations, and burnt-olTerlngs. The hymns to be 8uDg at these ceremonies are all prescribad, aDd the pictorial representations show how the gods were to be clothed and in what attitudes they Were to be shipped. Possibly all these rites were performed only by the priests of t In the inscriptions the expression invariably used for the proce.sions is the KinV, Who is regarded as tbe embodiment aDd representative of all his sllbjects.

ofSeti I. ABYDOS. 4. Route. 63 the temple. In any cate the chapels are too small to have admitted more than the heads of the deputations from other parts of Egypt. Great weight is laid upon the sacred number seven, as shown in the number of the cbapels themselves and in the .even buds of sparrow-hawks represented in eacb. That the king should appear as tbe seveuth object of worship along with six gods ia undoubtedly unusual; but it may be explained by the fact that Seli built the seventb chapel, not for the adoration of self wbile alive, but for a future period when be hoped to be merged in Osiris. Neither Seti nor his .on could avoid the interment of tbeir mies near the royal residence of Thebes; but it may be assumed th>& tbelr eartbly remains received consecration at Abydos, and that tbe lIemnonium of Seti is 10 be regarded as a cenotaph, in which the NamtJ of Pbaraoh, as a symbol of the king himself, was to be bonoured and preserved. The Pharaohs of tbe early empire possessed similar monuments here. These, however, fell into decay dnring the Hyksos period; and SeU was enabled to do what unfavourable times had hindered his predecessors from doing -'.e. to build a new and costly Memnonium, in whicb a place was served, near the tomb of Osiris, for the Nam" of his royal ancestors. In the arches above the niches in the rear-wall of the chapels are several representations of the king offering his Name, symbolised by tbe cartoucbe or ring which surrounded royal names. In thia way Abydos came to be the most important place for the preservation of liats of kings. The columned aisle leading to Seti's Cbapel (pl. a) contain a inscriptions and representations relating to tbe king alone and sbowing us his ship to the gods in U.s proper light. On the walled-up door to the first hall we see 'rhotb, the Reason or Intelligence, the god of tbe aciences and of historical records, offering a sacrifice in front of an image of the king (the latter unfortunately much damaged). The in.criplion reads 'I, Tholh, the dweller In Abydos, come to thee on account of thy greatness and thy glory. For the sake of thy sanctity as king, for tbe sake of thy might and thy constancy on earth, and to make thee great', etc. -On the umns of the first hall the king is represented as sacrificing and receiving the attributes of the kingdom from Tboth, AnUbis Apberu, Horus Ihe son of Isis, and Henmutef, the bigh priest of Abydos. 'rhe paintings on the S. wall of the same hall show us the king as a boy, held in the arms of Isis and suckled at the divine breasts of the Halhors. They admit him 10 tbe place of Horus, thai he· may increase h. strength and ascend tbe throne of Osiris as a man. Hathor, tbe queen-deity of HeUopolis in dos, calls berself tbe motber of bis beauty, and says to him: 'Thon bast been nourished by my milk. thou wbo art adorned with the crown of Upper Egypt'. The Halhor of Denderah calls herself his nurse, wbo raised her arms to embrace bis beauty. On tbe left side of the door fartbest to the left, also leading to tbe second ball, we see the king, wearing a helmet, while Thotb pours over bis head Ibe signs of life and dominion. To the right tbe king appears witb the ricbly deconted royal crown, bolding the sceptre and scourge in his hands. The priest Henmutef burns Incense fore him, and tbe Nile brings bim gifts, of whicb be is tbe producer. 'l'he king has now passed from the boy Horus to tbe man Osiris; Henmutef .aya: 'I burn incense to thee and to tby name, 0 Osiris, King Ra-ma-men'. The word. put in the moutb of tbe Nile are: 'I bring to tbee in my arms the superOuity as an offering, 0 King, lord of botb worlds!' On the sides of tbe columns facing the aisle leading to the royal chapel are represented Anubia·Apberu banding to tbe king the attributes of constancy and might; Tbotb, eitber pouring tbe water of life and dominion over the king, or addressing bim in set speecb, witb a roll in bis left band; Henmutef borting bim, sacrificing to him, and reacbing bim the sign of approval f'--", tbns reminding ns of tbe passage in Diodorus wbich tells us tbat it was the duty of tbe priests to praise and warn tbe kings.

66 Route 4. ABYDOB. Memnonium Memnonium at Abydos, which contains no fewer than 76 cartouches, only two of which are slightly injured. The tablet from the temple of Ramses (p. 68), now in London, oontains 16 entire and 2 halt destroyed cartouches, while the list of discovered by riette, has 39 whole and 3 damaged cartouches. Mena, i.e. Menes, the first historic king of Egypt, heads the list. The names following his are those of the most prominent monarchs, at least those whose legitimacy was NWW\ unquestionable. The Heracleopolitans and the Hyksos are n naturally left out, but other rulers, of whom we possess monuments, have also been apparently deemed unworthy of inclusion in this important roll of honour. The merit of first observing and publishing this inestimable historical document belongs to Prof. Diimichen. On the left wall of the corridor we again meet Seti and the youthful Ramses. The father holds a censer in his left hand, while the son, adorned with the priestly panther-skin, pours a libation on the altar in front of him. The titles of the right wall re-appear here. The inscription, which the royal pair faces, contains in matic order the names of these objects of worship, with their homes, whom Beti has honoured with sacrificial gifts. The sculpture in this corridor, consisting of alto-reliefs on the fine-grained limestone, is all executed with the greatest delicacy. In the centre of the right wall a door leads Into a narrow Chamber (Pl. t), vaulted in the same manner as the sanctuaries (p. 61), and preceding the stair (Pl. u) which leads to the hill at the back of the temple. The inscriptions here are in excellent preservation, being injured only in a few places; the adjoining ligures of Set! and Ramse8 show the latter arrived at manhood and the throne. Bdekh, the goddess' of history, 'the great mistress of books', addresses her darling son Seti. The ceremony of foundation, which we find more fully represented and described in the Ptolemaic temples, is also depicted here. The praises of the king are sung, and his merits are, at the command of Ra, to be committed to writing by the goddess of history. Thoth also congratulates the king in the emphatic manner usual to such inscriptions, and promises him an eternal existence and the stability of his kingdom for hundreds of thousands of years. Thoth is named the tongue of Ra and lord of the speech of the prophet of truth. This staircase was oompleted while Ramses shared the throne of his father a8 co-ruler. The other rooms of this part of the building are all more or less in ruins. From the S. end of the kings' gaUery we enter a kind of peristyle Court (PI. G), with seven columns, which perhaps was never completed. The sculptures and hieroglyphics are not very carefully exer.uted and appear 'en ereux' instead of in high relief. The most interesting scenes are those on the lower part of the walls, repr"lsentlng the slaughter of the cattle, gazelles, and antelopes which Set! had so lavishly vowed (in the adjoining king's gallery) DigitIZed by Coogle

Of Btti I. ABYDOS. 4. Route. 67 to the gods of the temple. Some of the resiating oxen are remarkably true to nature. Probably the sacrilicial animals were actually slain in this court, a conclusion strengthened by the broken pottery found here by Mariette and the two of turbid water. A well has also been discovered outside the E. wall of the temple, which may be the spring described by Strabo. The Room marked F on the plan is the most interesting of the other apartments in this wing. The entrance to it is on the left (S.) side of the space between the sanctuary and the third row of columns in the second hypostyle hall. The door leading to it is named 'the great door of Ra-ma-men (i.e. Seti), the favourite of Sokar'. To this deity, Osiris-Sokar orPtah-Sokar-Osiris, keeper of the realm of shades, this room is consecrated, though other gods, such aa Nefer Tum, Horus, and Thoth are also represented here. The king appears in the act of offering sacriliee. To the extreme right on entering, on the wall between the doors, are reliefa of richly adorned Nilometers, the symbols of the state of stability and permanenoe aimed at by Pharaoh j the inscriptions inform us that they were dedicated to the Osiris of the under-world, Sokar-Tatunen, who was worshipped in the Memnonium of On the entrance-wall, to the right of the door, is t1le bark of Sokar, and a list is given of the titles of this god of the many aliases, who was revered in· so many different spots. The form of the three columna preserved here is peculiar. The oylindrical shafts, which bear the abacus without any transitional member, are liattened at the points where their periphery would touch an exacribed square, and hence their section is in the shape of an octagon with four straight and four curved sides. -The doors to the right, on each side of the above-mentioned NilometerB, lead into two oblong rooms with vaulted ceilings, which have partly fallen in (Pi. q, r). -The other apartments of this wing contain nothing of special interest. They are all ruinous, and live of them cannot be entered except from the outside. -In visiting the Memnonium of Abydos, the traveller should bear in mind that he has to do with a cenotaph, dedicated to the manes of a king apotheosised as Osiris and to his forefathers ; and he should also remember that the site of the building was termined by the belief that the souls of those who had been lied' near the Holy Tomb could look forward with conlidenoe .to the highest joys of the world to come.

68 Boute 4. ABYDOS. Temple of Ram.u II. here is all the more striking from the obvious paius of the fouuder to make a costly and enduring monument. Where Seti contented himseItwith limestone, Ramses made lavish use of granite, Oriental alabaster, and black graywaoke. The remaining fragmenta show that Ramses erected obelisks of granite in front of his cenotaph, and that caryatide-like lIgures of Osiris, now long since shattered, stood at the sides of the lIret peristyle court. Plastic ornamentation was freely used and so richly painted that the colours have to this day clung to some of the fragments. Ramses followed the example of his father in consecrating a chamber to the manes of his ancestors. In 1818 Mr. Bankes discovered in the chamber to the left (E.) of the lIrst octostyle room a royal list of eighteen names, two of which were partly destroyed, and the relics of these tablets are still in .itu. M. Mimaut, the :French Oonsul General, tore down the walls on which the important cartouches were represented and sent the stones to Paris, whence they passed by purchase to the British Museum. Almost no inscription has been left intact here. We learn, however, that Ramees was much more anxious than his father to record his own achievements. Not a few names of peoples and towns which he subdued or captured may st1ll be discerned among the ruins. The visitor will gladly arrest his steps by the representation of a grand procession, which is to be found inside the great court, to the right and left of the entrance. The procession, beginning at the N. W. corner of the hall, which was formerly surrounded with Osiris-pillars, extends over the whole olthe N. wall. Four temple officials are represented, one described as a secretary, two with leopard-skins as priests of Osiris and of the house of Ramse's damon Khnumt Abdu (connected with Abydos), and the fourth as Kerhub. Animals, some living and some dead, are brought to them for sacritlce. Among these are antelopes, geese, and oxen of ordinary size and fatness. On the right side of the fore-court are similar scenes, in which the procession is still more grandly equipped. Here appear the royal war-chariot, numerous ofllcials, and negroes, while incense is burned before the statue of the monarch. The 00-louring of these lIgures is surprisingly well preserved. On the outside of the temple, N. side, is an inscription relating to the Khela war, discovered by Eisenlohr in 1870; unfortunately ouly the lower parts of lines are preserved. Adjacent, to the W. and N., are repreaeuhtion. of events iu the Khet> war. similar to those of the Ramesseum at Thebes. 'l'he exterior of the 8. well is covered with a long inscription, recounting the building of the temple, of which the following is a translation.

Like the temple of Seti, that of his son Ramses was also a sanctuary dedicated to Osiris, though in each r.ase the predominant feature is the glorification of the monarch in his apotheosis as Osiris. Mariette was therefore on a wrong tack when he saw a special temple of Osiris in the enclosure (PI. Ill; p. 52) to the N., near the village of El-Kherbeh, and spent much time and money in all attempt to find the actual grave of Osiris. Obviously this was merely an older sanctuary, erected by the kings of the 12th and 13th Dynasties on the site of a still more ancient temple. [Two stelE's in the Louvre, numbered 011 and 0 12, and the great stele of Mentuhotep, now in the museum of Gtzeh, give us information concerning these buildings.] Nowadays this temple is a mere heap of rubbish, and the few interesting 'finds' made here, such as the statues of Usertesen I. and Usertesen Ill., and some inscriptions of the time of Tutmes III., have been sent to the museum of Gtzeh. The same institution received the many hundred steles found partly on the site of this temple and partly in the Necropolis of Abydol. Three such cemeteries are distinguished. The first, containing tombs of the New Empire, from the 19th Dynasty downwarils, lies to the S. of the temples of Seti. I. and Ramses II. Another (Necropole du Oentre) lies to the W. of the path leading from the temple of Ramses II. to the so-called temple of Osiris, and contains graves mainly of the 6th and 11th Dynasties. Here was found the historically valuable tablet of Una (see Baedeker's Lower Egypt, p. 307), who accompanied three successive rulers of the 6th Dynasty in their campaigns. The third or N. necropolis, to the W. of the so-called temple of Osiris, contains numerous graves of the 12th and 13th Dynasties, but also many of the new empire. Among the interesting steles found here were those of a Neferhotep of the 13th Dynasty and of Sheshonk, the latter erroneously pronounced by H. Brugs(lh to have been a Persian satrap. The pyramidal tures found in the N. and central cemeteries are also interesting. Still farther to the W. lies a quadrangular enclosure surrounded by a lofty wall and named 8hunet es-Zeblb (Pl. IV; p.52; magazine of the Zibebes), which probably served as a place of defence against the incursions of the Beduins of the Great Oases. A Coptic Con'vent (Pl.

Between Belianeh and J}.eneh the Dtlm Palm (HyphalJla baica) becomes more and more common, generally occurring in groups and inoreasing in size and beauty as we travel southwards (comp. p. 28). It is a fan-leaved palm of moderate height, dividing into two parts at the upper end of the stem and sometimes ing this bifurcation two or three times. It extends far to the S. of Egypt, and whole forests of it are found on the npper NUe. Its large nuts contain a soft and fibrous pulp, which is edible and tastes like sweet oake j while various objects are made out of the hard rind. Its timber and bast are also of considerable indnstrial value. The ancient Lepidotum must have lain on the E. bank of the ri ver opposite Belianeh j but, though described by Ptolemy as a large town, no trace of it remains. The Lepidotus (the Cyprinus lepidotus of Geoffroy, and Cinex deutex of Savigny) was held here in high hononr, thongh, according to Plutarch, it was one of the fishes that swallowed the Phallus of Osiris and was hence generally regarded with special abhorrence. From Belianeh to J}.eneh the Nile valley lies almost due E. and W. Abont 4, M. from the S. bank lies 8amhtld, on ancient mounds.

The comparative width of the river·plain makes horse-breeding an important occupation among these tribes, and their shaggy grey dogs are also celebrated. The latters are frequently seen guarding the flocks of sbeep, and are easily distinguishable from the worthless and cowardly curs that haunt the streets of the towns and villages.

It owes its name, meaning 'geese pasture' Copt. !!IEItECH"T, from the ancient Egyptian Geese lake), to the fact that immense quantities of geese, a favourite food and sacri:tl.cial olfering of the old Egyptians, were reared here. Its pinquity to the home of Menes (This-Abydos) makes it seem quite natnral that graves of hoar antiquity (6th Dynasty) should be found in the neighbourhood. These are reached from the village of in about 11/. hr. Donkeys, but no saddles, may be tained, through the SMkh el-Beled. We :tI.rst ride through a tilled district, cross a bridge over a canal which waters the district, pass the village of Isbak, and reach the Arab hills. 'rhe ancient tombs, constructed of light-coloured and unusually :tI.ne-grained limestone, now come in sight j they date from the reigns of Pepi, Merira, and Raneferka, all of the 6th Dynasty. The large tomb situated farthest to the left contains representations and inscriptions which are identical in style with those in the most ancient part of tbe Necropolis of Memphis. Tbe ceiling was left rough-hewn. Some of the small inscriptions cut in the living rock near the entrance are in Coptic. The representations on the inside of the wall bave been almost wbolly. destroyed, but some ships may be distinguisbed to the rigbt of the door. On the right wall are figures bearing funereal gifts and a large sacri:tl.cial table. The rear-wall is divided into two distinct portions, as the left side of tbe tomb has been pusbed much farther into tbe rock than tbe rigbt. In the latter are two nicbes. That to the rigbt contains an image of the deceased, one of the chief dignitaries under the Pbaraoh Raneferka, named Zula From the second nicbe, farther to the left, a mummy-sbaft detloends obliquely j adjacent is a tio insoription. In tbe deeply recessed rear-wall of the left side are four smaller nicbes, probably intended for the cof:tl.ns of members of Zuta's housebold deemed worthy 01 special honour. -The next tomb, farther to the right, is of even greater interest than the one just described. It belonged to an of:tl.cial named Atk/ienu, who lived in the reigns of Pepi, Merira, and Raneferka, and was not only gaged in the construction olthe pyramids of these monarchs, but was also a distinguished warrior.

72 Route 5. TABENNA. From BeU4neh The names of the three kings and their pyramids were found in the inscriptions to the right and left of the entrance (outside). The tomb is in the form of a rectangle, with the mummy-shaft ing in the back-wall. The representation of Atkhenu, to the left of the entrance, is very lifelike and derives peculiar interest from the fact that the grandees of the early period are seldom represented, as here, in full military activity. Our hero, another Una (see Baedeker', Lower Egypt, p. 307), lifts the arm vigorously to strike his foe. The mode of wearing the hair and headdress, seen both in this ftgure and that of Atkheuu's wife, is unusual. Atkhenu W&8 a rich man, possessing, according to the inscriptions, 2350 oxen. On the left side of the rear-wall are represented several scenes from the private life of the deceased. Cattle are being slaughtered, cooks are busy at their work, etc. Above the door leading to the shaft we see a large altar, adjoining which is a long but much aged inscription. -The smaller tombs in the vicinity are less interesting. Several Coptic inscriptions testify that anchorites found retreats in these tombs during the Christian period. We are now approaching the region which, in the time of Pachomius, was most thickly populated with monks and anchorites. Farther on we pass a fine mountain-mass, which looks especially imposing by afternoon light, and see several thriving villages, often situated close to the river. Deahneh, a steamboat-station on the N. bank, 13 M. from is situated on the ruins of an ancient town. Tbellite of the celebrated Tabenna, which lay between Bou II.) and Denderah (Tentyra), must be lought for either here or cloae to Keneh. It belonged to the nome of Tentyra and its Coplic name wu tabonn ... h which may be translated 'place of the I.is palms.. The Greeks supposed that 'nesi' meant (nesos) or island, and hence it comes that the town of Tab.n"u,,_, altuated on the mainland, is generally spoken of as the I./and of Tab.n..... It is said that the Araba name it Outret "-Ollar. or II,. 01 the Wilt, but no support of this could be found on the spot. St. 1erome relates that at the end of the Uh cent. no fewer than 00,000 monks usembled in the district of Tabennesul to celebrate the Euter Festival. All of these followed the rule of Pachomius and longed either to the chief monastery (Monuterium Ma,jus) :or to the smaller c",nobia, laurae, and anchorite cella dependent on it. It is vellou. that the temple of Denderah (p. 80), '0 clole to this eommunity of fanatics, should have been left aimoat intact. Perhaps the explanation il that at the time the monks settled here the strife about dogmas aroused much more excitement in the eccleslutical breut than the di.Uke of heathen goda that had long since become harmless. 56 M. (17 M. from Deshneh) Jeneh (steamer-station), Ł town with 15,400 inhab., lies on theE. bank of the Nile at the point where the river, suddenly abandoning its northward course, turns to the W., almost at right angles. It is the capital of the ftfth Mudiriyeh of Upper Egypt, which is 597 sq. M. in extent and contains a population ...., of4.06,858. The Greek name of the town was K'lttVij1tOAJC,or 'NeJ'town'.

to .feneh. Ip:NEH. 6. Boute. 73 At the time of the pilgrimage to Mecca presents a very lively scene, as it is then frequented by large numbers of the participators in that great religious picnic. The spiritual and material wants of the pious lJedJ8.dj are catered for by six spacious mosques, rous coffee-houses, and a large number of places of amusement, among the attractions of which Egyptian dancing-girls are prominent. For the rest Keneh differs little in general character from the other towns of Upper Egypt. The traveller should not fail, however, to see the most valuable piece of land near which is about one Feddim (3500 sq.yds.) in area and yields an excellent variety of potter's clay that has made pottery, like that of A@siut,famous throughout the country. has a special reputation for its {{ulal (pI. of or cool porous water-bottles, and for its BaWls and Zfr, large vessels used in carrying, purifying, and preserving water. In some of the early Egyptian inscriptions figures of the Ballis and Zir appear as distinctive symbols, in the' exact forms in which they are made to-day. Hundreds of thousands of these clay vessels are annually exported from in boats of a primitive but not unpractical description, constructed for the purpose, in which they are piled up in pyramidal form, fastened together with ropes made of the bast of the date-palm and attached to rectangular frames. A trustworthy report fixes the number sent away in 1860 at 900,000. Considerable activity ii also manifested in the facture of kiln-dried pottery, generally either red or black, used for chibouk-heads, bottles, pitchers, vases, drinking-vessels, etc., of every size and shape. The almost invariably graceful forms and tasteful decorations of these utensils may be unreservedly set down as a bequest from ancient Egypt. 6. Routes through the Eastern Desert. Keneh is a place of some importance as the starting-point of the caravans traversing the Arabian d"esert to If ŁŁ ir (p. 77) and as an porium of the trade of Upper Egypt with the coast-districts of the Red Ilea. It consequently affords a good opportunity of making a short and comparatively easy desert journey, as the interesting e"cursion to can be m&<le without any very great privation or danger. The route le&<ls vii HamlJm4t, traversing the rocky Arabian Desert, which is not only of greai scenic grandeur but also fnll of interest for the ralist and the archll!ologist. Ko,ar, a port on the Red Sea, is about 110 Ł. from IFeneh, and the journey can be m&<le comfortably in four, or at most five days. . These desert-routes were important even in antiquity for the trade with the seaports and the land of Pu"t (Arabia) on the one side and the valuable quarries in the mountains of the Arabian Desert on the other. Spices and other costly products were sent across the desert to Keneh, at first on donkey-back and afterwards on camels, wbile green lireccia and several varieties of granite were sent down to the sea in return. The most important points on the Red Sea, named from N. to 8., were Myo. HortltO. (now .Abu Bar d·Kiblt), in the latitnde of }[onfalilt; Leuleo. Limetaknow and B.r"""., in the latitude of Assuan.

74 BouCIl6. Bm'AMBAR. the Roman town and colony of H,dr_ or FDM 2nVomu, whieh lies in the latitude of Ki.u, about 3 days' journey from Keneh. Outside the walls lie a temple and other buildings, and some large columns and Greek inscriptions have been found in the quarries, which were worked cbieRy in the time of Hadrian and About two days' journey farther to the N. is Gebel DuW" ('smoke mountain'), the ancient porphyry quarries of which were worked by the Romans. Here are the ruins of an Ionic temple of the time of (never completed), some remains of an gularly built town, and two large water·reservoirs. The old route led hence to MilO. Hormo., the harbour of which has been silted up and Is now praeticalJy useless. Travellers making for the Sinai Peninsula ney to the N. from the porphyry qnarries for two or three days more, and cross by boat to 'far (see Ba.d"","'. Lower EVVl't, p. lit!)}. Those who undertake one of these journeys should study the 'Relsebrlefe' of Lepslus and Wilkinson's well·known work. A much more interesting journey than that to Gebel Dukhan is the trip to Or at least to W4dl H_4m4l, where there are numerous Egyptian inscriptions. For the journey (there and back) 10-11 days .hould be allowed, and EgyptolOgists will probably want 2·3 days more. It is generally undertaken from Keneh, but we may also choose the old route from (Koptos, p. 98), 'or we D!ay 8tart from Luxor. The 8rst two routes unite at .I-Kar .. and are jomed at Lak8faA by that from Luxor. The necessary camels may be obtained in Kenen with the aid of one of the consular agents (comp. p. 72). The route from Keneh (telegraph-wires from \{tl, to leads IIr,t through the villages' of Shi/A R.I;Iib, D6meh, and Kum 'Im,.4", which follow each other in quick the IIrst on the left, the other two on the right side of the road. The 8rst night i. generally spent at the caravanserai of Btr 'Ambar, about 8'/. hr Ł. from Kenoh, where the lofty palms and shady sycamore8 and mimosll! otfer a most inviting haUing.plaee. 'rbe large caravanserai was erected at the expense of an Ibrahim Pasha for the nse of the caravans and the Hecca pilgrims. The structure comprl8.s several 8eparate buildings, covered with dome-shaped roofs and 8urrounded by courts and nade.. It has no owner and Ie free to everyone to use as he likes. As nothing is done to keep It in repair, it is rapidly falling into decay, like most of the Oriental buildings of the kind, and threatens loon to be a complete ruin. In the deserts of Upper Egypt the temperature at night i. so mild, even in winter, that strong and healthy persons may safely sleep in the open air if warmly wrapped up; and for various reasons this is preferable to a night in the caravanserai. however, who prefer to take their chances in the interior should not fall to make the most mluute examiuation of the room in which they intend to sleep, in order to clear out the vermin with which it is almost certaiu to be infested; scorpions and venomous snakes are by no means uncommon visitants. It is the duty of the .KhtJl>I,., or guide in charge of the caravan, to see that everyone and everything are ready betimes in the morning, so that a sufficiently early start may be made to cover the ground allotted to each day's march. He is held responsible for the safe eonduet of the entire party, and expects implicit obedience to his marching orders. We soon turn our backl on the verdant green district bordering the Nile and enter the barren desert, almost entirely destitute of vegetation, whieh lies between the great river and the coast of the Red Sea. The 8rst part of the route is very unedifying. We advanee steadily, ascending almost imperceptibly, through a monotonous plain, interseeted in all directions by amall undulating heights. All around us extend8 the interminable yellowish gray. sun·bleached rocks of the desert; not a trace of life Is visible, not a single green tree or shrub.

6. Route. 75 DOwn. From the hieroglyphics on the rocks and temple-walls at mat we learn that the ancient Koptos road formed a link, as ea'ly as 0000 years before onr era, in the intercourse carried on between the Nile valley and Arabia, via the desert and the sea. We now ride in a S.E. direction through a dreary district, in which the only variety is afforded by an occasional Jl6blJ)a/a Or MCJ/ialta. The )(obwalas are simply spaces covered with camel's dung, easily distin· guished from the surrounding soil by their darker colour aud their smooth, cement-like surface. They occur on every great caravan route at regulor intervals and are of the utmost importance as sign-posts showing the road. Hence no khablr or camel-driver passes one of these places without giving hI! camels an opportunity to contribute their quota to the maintenance of the Mohwala. The MCJ/iaHIJI or halting-places are 7'lr9 H. apart and serve also as measures of distance. The swift-running camels take their name from the number of they can reach in one day. Thus a camel which can cover 10 ma\la»as, , .Ł. 711-90 )(., in one day is known as an '.AMari (runner of 'ten'). Uther milestones of the desert are afforded by the skeletons of camels, horees, and ass68, and by small cairns above the remalns of unfortnnate travellers who have lost their lives in this dreary waste. The K.r caravans usually pass the second night In the village of (9 nrs. from and Blr 'Ambar, 121/2 hrs. from J!:eneh), which is chiefly inhabited by'.AbabtHA; it is also a haltlng·place for caravans ing in the opposite direction. The small oasis has two wells, live palms, a small piece of tilled ground, a few mud·huts, and a half-ruined Arab vanaerai. It is a characteristic specimen of a desed-vlllage and offers much to interest the stranger. It is a place of great comfort and convenience to the tranller, as its resOllrces include the materials for a solid and satisfying anpper in the shape of mutton, goat's flesh, poultry, eggs, etc. The dogs here are great thieve!1 and care should be taken to leave nothing within their reach at night. lIear the chief well are some fragments of a Greek inscription of the reign of Tiberius Claudius. The ftrat Roman military station, the Bydreuma, now called by the Arabs J!afr "-BOIIdI ('castle of the maidens'), Is 8 hrs. from It lies to the S. of the caravan route and forms an oblong 125 ft. In length and 101 ft. in breadth. The wall inclosing the oblong, formed of layer. of sandstone without cement, was 6'It ft. high. Within the wall lie 20 small chambers opening on a rectangular inner court, the only exit from which is on the N. side. No water is now procurable here. To the N. of the path, opposite the ruin of the Hydreuma, stands a rock of .tone with numerouS gr&fllli in Greek, Coptic, Arabic, Himyarilic, and Sinaitlc characters. At a distance of about 2 hr Ł. from the Hydreuma the rocks close in and form a winding pass or gateway named a-So/dm. On the 9.1 .Ab" K1)l." ('father of the el bow'), the rock at the entrance to tbe paso, are more graffiti, older those at el·Benat; one of them contains the name of the religIOUS reformer Amenhotep IV. We now approach the fine rocky scenery through which the second part of the KOfer route leads. In the distance, to the right, rise the S. foot-hills of tne Hamdmdl MI,., while nearer an41n front are the S.W. spurs. out the whole of the Nile valley from Cairo to Philre the traveller counters no such picturesque scenery as he sees In traversing the ftcent reeky fnrmatlnn. of this part of the Egyptian-Arabian desert.

The outliers of the range consut of a yellow sandstone, followed by the red 'Nubian' sandstone, resembling that of the Black Forest, while the great central masa Is composed of granite. Beyond the Ilu!rak es-Sellm the hills again diverge. Among them, to the N. of the caravan· route, lies a second Roman station, with a In well.

In front is a fore-court 281/. ft. in width and 12 ft. in depth, which was adjoined by the temple proper (Inner length 81 ft.), comprising two rows of apartments. The central apartment, with some· what sloping sidce, seems to have been the main one, as its right and leCt walls and also the outside of the entrance-wall (to the left) bear traces of paintings, representing a king sacrificing to various deities. The name of the Emp. Tiberius, sacrillcing to the god Khem, appears here. The representation on the left outside-wall shows an emperor (probably Hadrian) appearing before a goddess, who seems to be, from the legend, the tutelary deity of the green ("'h. uaz) emerald mine. To the left oC this main aparlment is a covered corridor, with a window, and jacent is a staircase leading to the roof. The temple was cleared from rubbish in 1873 by Purdy Pasha, an American in the Egyptian service. The Emerald Kines, which were visited last century by Bruee (1168 -73) and in this century by CaiJliaud (18111-18), Belzoni, and Beechey, were worked by the Arabs, according to Bakrizi, down to the year 760 of the Hegira (1870 A.D.), after which they were abandoned. 1Il0l;lammed 'Ali made an unavailing attempt to reopen them. They lie partly in the Wcidi &1&11 and partly on the Gebel ZabciraA, 14. If. to the N.E. They are best visited from Contra Apollinopolis, but may, like Berenike, be proached by following the coast of the Arabian Gulf from -\toter. The IIrst route diverges from the road to Berenlke at P1II1Iaero. Between Contra-Edfu and the mines are three old stations. At the IIrst of these is the Dame of a sun-worshipping king of the 18th Dynasty. Close to the second, 18 hrs. from the Nile, is a temple hewn in the rock, the T"'!'J!" 01 R.dill"." (80 called aCter the place of that name on the Nile; 8ee p. 2DiI), which Seti 1. dedicated to Ammon. No precions stones are now found in the emerald mines.

The wall enclosing the temple is formed of Nile bricks, and there is another entrance on the W. side. The total enclosnre is 317 yds. long and 306 yda. wide, and besides the large temple of Rathor contains a small sanctuary dedicated to Isis and a so-called 'birth-house' (see belOW). The N. door, which is in a straight line with the temple, is only 150 to the E. of N. j but in the temple-inscriptions it is always spoken of as the E. entrance, while the long sides of the temple are called the N. and S. sides.

On the side next the temple appears the name of Nerva Trajanus, also with the epithets of Germanicus and Dacicus. From the N. gate a modern brick passage leads to the temple. To the left of this passage lies a building deep-sunken in the bris and wanting its front.

Similar Birth-Homes (Egypt. rn r pa-mes), called 'place of birth'), occur in many other Egyptian temples (pp.253, 289, etc.). The cartouches of Autokratof' Kisres, which Hathor presents to rus Sam taui, have been supposed to refer to Augustus; but the fact that the latter had no son makes this very doubtful. The house' also contains the names of Trajan and Hadrian, to whom it probably owes its existence. The paintings represent the care of the young Horus, who is nursed and ministered to by goddesses and women with cows' heads. -We now proceed to the temple, either by ascending over the heaps of rubbish, or by returning to the N. gate and walking thence in a straight direction. "Temple of Rathor at Denderah. This interesting and much-admired building was dedicated to HathOf', the Egyptian Venus. The Pottico (PI. E), which is ported by 24 columns, is 139 ft. in breadth. Each of the columns has a capital formed of four heads of Hathor, with cows' ears, surmounted by a house, in reference to the meaning of Hathor, Hat (i.e. house) of Hortls. The columns next the entrance show an open door. The six columns in the front row, three on each side of the entrance, are united by balustrades. The rubbish round the temple reaches to the balustrades in front and nearly to the roof on the E. side; hence the tloor of the temple appears sunken and is reached by a flight of wooden steps. Originally, however, the temple stood level with the ground, and its present ance, like that of the temples of Esneh and Edfu, i8 due to the cumulated rubbish of centuries. In accordance with the plan of other temples, a colonnade and a pylon should stand in front of this portico; but perhaps the means to add these were not forthcoming.

Tiberius Olaudius A.D.). There are, however, many representations of the Emp. Nero both inside and outside the temple. The crypts of the temple date from the reigns of Ptolemy X., PtolemyXI., and Ptolemy XIII. (Soter II.; Ptolemy Alexander; N eos Dionysos)., The inscriptions mnning round the temple refer to Ptolemy XVI. Oresarion and the Emp. Augustus. On the exterior of the rear-wall of the temple pears Ptolemy KiRes, aCClompanied by Oleopatra VI. and the little Oresarion; the inscription is Ptulmis, surnamed Kisres. In both cases the Oresarion referred to is apparently the son of Oresar and OIeopatra. The temple would thus seem to owe its present form to the last of the Ptolemies and the Arst Roman emperors. It is, ever, obvious that the site was previously occupied by older temple buildings, going back to the earliest period of Egyptian history. King Pepi of the 6th Dynasty is repeatedly represented in the crypts. In one of these crypts (No.9) the ancient building plan of derah is mentioned twice. The Arst of these mentions occurs in the desClription 01 an excursion of the goddess to Edfu on the Arst of Epiphi: 'The great building-plan (senti) of Ant (Denderah) was found written in anClient characters on hide, of the time of the cessors of Horns. Found in the interior of the wall of the royal palace in the time of King Pepi'. Another passage reads: 'The great plan of Denderah, a restoration of the monument made by King Ramenkheper (Tutmes Ill.), after it was found in ancient cbaraeters of the time of King Khufu'. The priests of Tentyr-a thus ascribed the foundation of their temple to Khufu and Pepi. There are, however, stones bearing the names of Amenemha I., mes III., Tutmes IV., Ramses II., and Ramses III., all of whom probably either built or restored parts of the old temple. If we compare the temple of Denderah a similar structure of the earlier period, such· as the temple of Abydos or the great national sanctuary of Karnak, we And it not less beautiful in its own way, though of Clourse Car from eompeting with these gigantic structures in magn11lcence or extent.

A happy blending of Egyptian seriousness with Grecian grace, which meets us unmistakably at every tum, has a peculiarly pleasing ejfect, and we feel much more at home in the halls of the Bathor of Tentyra than in the great hall of the god of Thebes, with ita forest of gigantic eolumns.

Prof. Diimichen uncovered the inacription at the foot of the exterior wall of the temple in 1875 (p. 97), and foond that, as at Edfu, the names and dimensions of the chambers lying to the north were inscribed on the N. side, and on the S. side those of the chambers lying to the south. He has published the inscription with a translation t. In our description, we begin with the Hypo8tyle Hall or *Khent Hall (PI. E). The first large hall of an Egyptian temple frequently bore the name rI1 Khmt, i.e. front room, as is the case here, at Edfu, at Philae, and elsewhere. It has several other names as well. Apparently with reference to the astronomical representations which adorn both halves of the ceiling, it is frequently named in the in-Oom X scrlptions F==;j '0 <::> 'Nut ",elch ur t' i.e. Great Hall of 01;) 0 the Goddess Nut, who as the symbol of the vault of heaven was re-presented as a tall woman bending her face towards the earth and letting her arms hang down A colossal representation of this tlgure i8 met with twice on the ceiling of the hypostyle room at Denderah, and it is repeated twice more, in the apartment marked XV. on the plan and in the central Osiris-room on the N. side of the temple-roof. In the two last instances it occupies the entire sllrface of the ceiling. Astronomical representations, whether simply golden stars scattered promiscuously on a blue ground, or actual copies of the constellations as seen at some particular time, have been adopted as a suitable ceiling-decoration in nearly every tian temple and tomb. The two names above given are by far the commonest for this 1I.rst room, but it is also called 'the seat of Osiris, Horus, and Isis', and it is named in the inscriptions 'the dwelling of Hathor, the house of the sistrum-playing, tho house in which tho tambourine is sounded, the seat of the rapture of joy, the place of the celestial goddess Nat'. The hall is 143 ft. broad, 80 deep, and about 00 ft. high. On festal occasions the image of the goddess was conveyed in her boat to this Hall of Heaven, to meet thore the sun-god, her father. The decorative designs in this room chiefly consist, after the ancient Egyptian custom, of representations of the royal builders of the temple. The Roman emperors Augustus, Tiberins, Oaltgola, Claudius, and Nero are in tum depicted, each bearing some dedicatory gift for Hathor or some other of the gods worshipped at Denderah.

In the flrst we see the king (Nero) quitting his palace, preceded by flve banners with sacred figures, while the high-priest (named Anmut-f) offers incense before him. In the second design, Roms and Thoth sprinkle the king with the symbols of life; in the third, the goddesses of the south (Nuheb) and oUhe north (Uas) present him with the white crown and the crown 'Nefert' j in the fourth and last, the king is conducted before Rathor by the gods Month of Thebes and Tum of Reliopolis. Admission into the temple proper was not granted to him until after this mony had been gone through, and the purification by incense and holy water completed. The tations referring to these, and the explanatory inscriptions, are quite in the same manner as those we have already noted in the earlier temples of the time of Tutmes and Ramses. The sculptured ornamentation on the ceiling, dealing with astronomical subjects, is divided into a W. and an E. half. The figures in the W. section are turned towards the N. (outside), those of the other to the S. (inside). Each section is divided into three bands, mosi of which consist of two or more rows. The exterior banda of each section correspond to each other, as do also the central and inner bands. Between the two sections is another band, containing 10 sun-discs and 11 vultures, explained by Prof. Lauth as referring to the 21st year of the reign of 'J.'iberius. -The exterior bands, whioh are embraced ·by a tall IIgure of the goddess of the heavens, contain the twelve signs of the. Zodiac in their upper rows j to the right those of the N. sky (lion, serpent instead ofthe virgin, balances, scorpion, archer, goat), to the left or S., those of the S. sky carrier, flshes, ram, bull, twins, crab). In pdl row appear also the prindpal constellations (Orion, Siriul, Bothis) and five planets (Saiurn, Mars, Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury). Mingled with the other figures are the gods of the twelve houri of night, on the E. side in ascending order (I to XU), and on the W. side in descending order. The second rows of the exterior bands each contain 18 ships, with the 'Decani' or presidents of the weeks, mentioned elsewhere in other inscriptions. This 10Dg series begins in the W. section and ends in the E. section. The second bands, both on the right and lett, consist of two rows each. At the four ends of the upper rows are the four Winds, with upanded wings, which are adjoined on the right (next the entrance) by four figures of gods referring to Ra, and on the left by four similar figures referring to Tum, the god of evening. Then follows a series of ' Dec ani', beginning in the W. and tinued in the E. sectioD, consisting of the above-mentioned six 'Deeani' arranged in twelve groups of three, each conducted by a president usually in the form of a serpent.

The interior band on the W. side exhibits three designs ferring to the moon, which is here represented as 'uza', eye. In the lIrst are the 14 days of the waning Dloon, in the second the 14 days of the waxing moon, represented by 14 divinities ascending a 1I1ght of steps, while the victorious Thoth appears as a fifteenth divinity beyond the moon-diso. Finally appears Osiris as the god, seated with Isis and Nephthys in a boat, fioating above the symbol of the sky which is supported by four female forms. -In the E. section the interior band exhibits the course of the disc through the 12 hours olthe day, represented by 12 boats. In each disc appears the lIgure of the divinity to which the particular hour was sacred. On the W. side of the hall, between the second and third row of columns (to the right of the entrance), and on the E. side tween the third and fourth row (on the left) are 8ide-liJnC,.ance" through which the sacrillcial offerings used to be bronght into the hall (com. p. 88). Of the three Proseko8 Halls which we next enter, by far the largest is the hexastyle lIrst hall, the -Hall of the Appearanoe (pI. D), called in the inscriptions usekh Ua or Hall of the Appearance, and 'Hall of the Appearance of Her Highness', i.e. Hathor, the golden-rayed. The inscription at the foot of the external wall gives the measurement of this hall as 26 ells square, which closely coincides with its actual ;, ...... size, 461/2 ft. square. On festsl days the· image of the mighty sun-goddess was carried in lemn procession from its place in the holy of holies, and was not seen by the mnltitude sembled in the vestibule until it reached this hall, when the lofty double doors were thrown open. Hence probably the name of the hall. It is a remarkable fact that except in the Khent Hall, the secret passages, and Room xx (p. 88), the cartouches of the kings in all the interior rooms of 
the temple remain empty. In Room xx the accompanying royal cartouehes are found: 'Lord of the mIers, chosen by Ptah', and 'Kaisaros, ever-living, beloved by Ptah and Isis'. The latter, which is also found on the exterior W. wall of the -temple, probably refers to Augustus, though the same designation was also used for CaUgula, Claudius, and Nero.

The temple was probably nUt ill the unsettled times of the later Ptolemies, and the priests were fore left in doubt whether to flll in the cartouches with the name of Ptolemy or of Augustus. The representations en the walls and columns, many of which well deserve special attention, exhibit here also the Egyptian ruler worshipping Hathor or some other of the diTinities revered· in her temple. They illustrate several most remarkable ceremonies, which the king performed according to the prescribed ritual in presence of the images of the gods in the temple. We have seen reason to lieve that the sculptured decorations of all the temple-cllambers were executed about the end of the period of the Ptolemies and the beginning of the Roman empire. (The sculptures in some of the chambers in the sunk-floor and in several of the higher secret sages, date from the reigns of Ptolemies X., XI., and Xln.) Yet in spite ofihat, the entire adornment on the walla is arranged according to early Egyptian patterns; so that the eeremonies here depicted were not flrst introduced under the empire, and probably no Roman emperor ever took part in these eeremonies in this temple of Hathor. The walls of the temple at Denderah exhibit exclusively Eat'ly tian Mantlet" and CustOt7l8. What we here learn are the ceremonies imposed by the priesthood on the early Egyptian monarch who sired to worship the goddess. Thus in a representation to the right of the entranee the king appears twiee over in the lame deaign. First we see him, clad in a long robe and carrying a staff, entering the hall, preceded by the priest wearing the panther-skin and sprink.ling incense on the burning eenser. Next we see him ing before the image of Hathor, his robe laid aside; bending ward he goes through the motion of cleaving the earth with the short hand-plough in his hand, beeause it was an immemorial custom that the Egyptian king should turn the flrst sod on the lite of a temple. (In the explanatory inSCription here, as elsewhere, this ceremony is named 'blli ta', cleaving of the ground.) The king also smote the flrst blow with the hammer at the laying of the dation-stone, and shaped the flrst brick for the enclosing walls, which were usually buUt of unburned bricks of Nile-mud dried in the lun. All these eeremonies performed byeat'Zy Egyptian monarcha at the foundation of a temple, are here faithfully recorded acoording to early models, both in visible shape and by explanatory scriptionl. They are also recorded in the lowest of the four rows on the W. and E. exterior walls of the temple. In the temple of Horus at Edfu the k.ing il represented performing aimnar monies.

The ceremony is named in the I,naeription 'tIM Building of the Temple'; and the words placed in the mouth of the king and arranged above the Khus run: 'I have built the monument, the great one, as a perfect building to all eternity'. The ceremony represented in the following design also refers to tbe building of the temple. The king, kneeling before Bathor, is shown shaping the first burned . brick for the girdle-waU of tbe temple. As bas already been tioned in the description of the cult of Batbor, that goddess is quently extoUed in tbe inscriptions at Denderab as the godde,s of joy. at whose festival wine ftowed freely and the air was fragrant witb incense aud aU tbe perfumes of Arabia. Tbus, as the tions here inform us, tbe king mingles grains of incense aUlI wine witb tbe material out of which he moulds tbe brick. On both sides of the portal admitting to the hall are two long inscriptions, each consisting of 14 vertical lines, and containing a list of all the names under which the great Bathor was worshipped at Denderah and where in Egypt. This is foUowed hy a list of the chief gods and divine geniuses, those of the temple at Edfn being named in est detail j and finally comes a list of the sacred serpents of Denderah, which were probably not kept in the temple itself, but in the joining sacred groves.

We may therefore name this apartment the Temple Laboratof'Y. t All the designs and inscriptions on the four walls of this apartment refer to the incense prepared and preserved here j to tbe oils and ointments used in the temple services i and to the various ingredients of whicb they were oomposed.

In two of the designs the king is accompanied by one of the lords of the laboratory, once with the divine MCUlter of Anointing 1 Maset, once with Horus, the 'ord of the lebo-ratory , in the other two, by a goddess and two ram's-headed divinities, who also stand in some relation to the work of the laboratory. Both the king and his companiolls offer some of the costly perfumes of the laboratory to the gods above named. The room next the laboratory (PI. XIX) is named in the inscrip-tions here found simply m;; Sahi, which means room', 'room', 'hall', 'apartment'. An indicstion as to its former use is afforded by the representations on the walls, which depict the king offering the tlrst fruita of the flelds, plants, flowers, and fruits, to Hathor and her fellow-divinities. Several times in the panying inscriptions Hathor is extolled as 'she who produees all things', 'the nourishment-giving', 'she who provides food and drink, from whom everything comes that heaven bestows or the earth brings forth'. From these representations and inscriptions 
it may safely be concluded that this room was specially dedicated to the great Hathor as the deity who bestowed life and created and served all things, and that the offerings intended for Hathor were placed here on her festal day. The next room (PI. xx) is called in the inscriptions .Po 'v["J l!er-iib, i.e. 'the inner central room', or the Middte Room, probably because it lay between 
Hall D and the E. side-entrance of the temple, which oJ?ened into this room (comp. p.89, Room XXII, on tbe opposite side). From the inscriptions we learn that it was used for the reception of the offerings which were brought into the temple by the side-entrance. It has been mentioned above (p. 85) that in a representation in this room (beside the door of exit) the royal cartouches above the monarch worshipping Hathor have been fllled ill with the offlcial name of Augustus, whereas elsewhere the cartouches are left vacant.

In the doorway the monarch is represented in the act of entering, and presenting to Hathor a jewel-casket, whieh a hieroglyphic inscription at the monarch's feet states to contain gold, silver, lapis -lazuli, and malachite.

The representations on the walls oorrespond to the marginal inscriptions. Thus over the portal by which we enter is a double representation of the ruler of Egypt. In one case he stands before the altar of Hathor, in the other before that ofIsis, performing the ceremonies of offering incense and libation. This he does in his capacity as chief pontiff, as the aecompanying inscription implies: 'The sun, the son of the sun (the emperor Augustus), as priest of the incense ('lord at the seat of fragrance'), offering inr,ense to his mother, and &8 priest of the libations, holding the vessel of libation'. The wall opposite bears several representations of the monarch ing his homage in offerings to Hathor, who is accompanied by Horus or her son Ahi. The llrst side-door, to the left of the entrance to Hall C, admits U8 to a narrow Ante-t'oom (Pl. XVII), named m n LJ i.e. Btait'case-Room, in the inscriptions. At the farther end are four steps, beyond whieh a door, opening on the right, leads into the large STAmcASE HALL, whence an easy stone stairease ascends straight to the roof. This hall is in complete darkness as it is roofed over and admits no light from the sides. Another ascent to the roof is found on the opposite or W. side of Hall C, reached by a door to the right of the entrance to that room, and also by a smaller approaoh from Room XXIII (comp. p. 90). This second ascent is not by a straight and dark flight of steps, but by a kind of spiral staircase, with ten rectangular bends to the right, lighted by means of openings piercing the wall diagonally and widening towards the interior. The representations and inscriptions in the ante-rooms to the right and left and on the walls of both staircases refer exclusively to the entrance to the halls and the ascent of the staireases on the Great New Year's On that oceasion the ceremonial procession of the priests with the images of Hathol and her fellow-gods, after completing the circuit of the lower rooms, ascended to the roof of the temple, in order that 'the goddess thor might be united with the beams of her father Ra, on this noble day, the festival day of the beginning of the year'. The most comprehensive idea of the festival is given by the representations on the two walls (eaeh about til'i ft. long) of the straight East Staircase, whieh begins from Room XVII.

Her cycle of gods is at her right hand and at her left j she protects her loved son, the sun (i.e. not the,sun-god but his earthly tative, the reigning king of Upper and Lower Egypt)'. The mentioned union of the right eye with the left eye, i.e. of the sun with the moon, at which the New Year's festival at Denderah took place, is one of the astronomical epochs of the calendar veiled in mythological language by the Egyptian priests. We next eern upon poles the images of a jackal and of an ibis, the bols of Anubis as guide of the dead and of the god Thoth, which are described in an eight-lined vertical inscription, after whioh the explanatory inscription is closed by five more lines, as follows: '0 Hathor, thon ascendest the staircase in the town of the sweet life, in order to gaze upon thy father on the day of the New Year's festival.

It was probahly used in the preparations for the festival ceremonies that took place in the joining Hall of the Altar; and among its inscriptions in honour of Hathor is one that seems to indicate that the temple at Denderah is to be regarded as a replica of a celebrated temple of the sun-god of Heliopolis, of which however no trace now remains. Here a reference is made to the gilding and painting of the sculptured namentation, which are so often mentioned in the inscriptions. A careful examination of the walls in some of the rooms will still detect traces here and there of this painting. We now pass through the ('entral portal in the rear-wall of Hall C, and enter the last of the Prosekos Halls. This is the Hall of the OJo1e of Goa. (PI.

(With this we may compare the representation of the goddess above the central portal in the rear-wall, i.e. above the entrance to the Adytum A.) The adjoining room to the left (Pi. xli) is named in the in-scriptions r loll i.e. the Cloth Room or Wardrobe. It was the repository for the sacred wreaths and garments, with which the images of Hathor and her fellow-gods were adorned at the festivals celebrated in the temple and sometimes at the great new year's festival. According to the sculptures and inscriptions the prepared perfumes were also placed here. One half of the room was devoted to the garments, the other to the sacred perfumes. Over the latter presided the divine Mazet, previously mentioned among the agers of the manufacture of the incense and anointing oil as one of the lords of the laboratory (p. 88); over the former Hathotep, god of woven fabrics, with his compauion the goddess Tai, held sway.

The name ] i.e. OhiefFestal Ohamber, is occasionally bestowed upon all three rooms in the inscriptions, both on account of the preparations here made for the chief festival at Denderah, the great new year's festival on the morning ofThoth ist, and on account of the preliminary celebration before this festival, which was also conducted in this suite of rooma with great splendour by the priests of Hathor, 'on the day of the Night of the Ohild in his oradle'(Jg, cP T §1l r 0). i.e. the 4th Epagomene or intercalated day, on the night of which the closing festival of the Egyptian year began.

Only once a year was this permitted even to him, at the great festival of the New Year. We here see the monarch opening the door of the sacred cella, closed with a sealed band of byblos. Be breaks the seal and removes the strip of byblos (8e8h tebtu and 8eker atera), he places his hands in the two rings on the door and thrusts back the bolts, ascends the steps leading to the ceila, and finally gazes upon the hidden figure of the goddess, and offers his homage. Other designs exhibit the monarch performing the prescribed ceremonies of offering incense the two sacred boats of Bathor and her companion, Horus of Edfu, and before the boats of Isis and her companion Osiris. The portable boats (Tes-nefru, i.e. 'the bearers of beauties'), which are here depieted on the side-walls, formerly stood in Reom A, and held the shrines in which were the sacred images of the deities. The shrines were carried in solemn prOCf'ssions by the priests, sometimes without the bosts, as e.g. at the ne\1\' year's festival presented on the staircase (p. 91), and sometimes standing in the boats. The Bide-rooms of the Adytum are, as mentioned above, entered from corridor a. Behind the Adytum, to the S., lies No.1, the Large Chamber, the largest and most sacred of these side-rooms. The sanctity of this chamber is evidenced by the painting, in which the king is portrayed exactly as in the Adytum itself, ascending the steps to the shrine of Bathor, breaking the seal, and opening the doors, grasping the handles in his hands. Noteworthy also are the representations of the king offering vases of wine to Hathor and to Ahi, her son, in each case followed by a harp-playing goddess of the north and of the south. Two other pictures represent Pepi, the original builder of the temple (p. 81), kneeling before Bathor, bearing Abi in his hands, and the later builder with a mirror before the goddess in a double shrine.'

Tempk. DENDERAH. 7. Route. 97 oorresponding temple room. Six of the twelve crypts are beneath the ground-level, and of these two are ill the first hypostyle hall E (Nos. 11 and 12 in Pl. n). The entranoe to orypt No. 10 is in Room 11In, adjoining Hall D. Of the remaining three subterranean crypts (Nos. 1,4, 7), the first is only accessible by a flight of steps descending from crypt No.2, which lies above it and is entered by an opening in the wall of Room VII. The discomforts of the climb are compensated in this case by the sight of two crypts, the lower one, the largest of all, consisting of 7 chambers, and the upper one adorned with representations and inscriptions in unusually good preservation. No.4, entered from Room VIn, and No.7, from Room XIV, are closed with doors, which the temple-keeper will open on request. Good stone stairs lead to both, and no visitor should fail to visit at least these two crypts. Magnesium wire or a lamp will be found useful in examining the painted walls. On the case leading to No.4 occurs a mention of a festival celebrated on the 4th Epagomene day, and within the crypt is a painting of king Pepi, kneeling and offering a golden statue of Ahi. All these statues, whose dimensions are given, were probably kept in the orypts. Still more important are the inscriptions in .crypt No.9 (mentioned on p. 81), which is entered by a very narrow hole high up in Room x. The oalendar-dates of festivals instituted by mes Ill. (1700 B.C.) are here found. Mention is also made of the fact that the ancient plan of the temple under Cheops was covered in the reign of King Pepi (6th Dyn.). We now ascend one of the staircases mentioned on p. 91 to the Temple Boof. Caution must be observed on account of the holes made in the roof to admit light and air to the rooms below. At the S.W. angle of the roof stands a small open pavilion, supported by 12 columns, which played an important part during the solemn procession at the festival of the new year (p. 91). We pass through this pavilion in passing from the E. stairoase to the W. chambers. The W. staircase, whioh ascends in successive flights, leads past a room in the middle story, probably used as a workshop for restoring and repairing the statues and utensils of the temple. Six chambers on the roof, three on the W. and three on the E., the first in each case being unroofed, were used in the worship of the slain and risen Osiris, as curious representations indicate. The second room on the E. side formerly contained the famous Zodiac of Denderah, now in the Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris. Finally a walk round the outsiJe of the temple will be found interesting. The Inscriptions, so frequently referred t.o above, which contain the names and dimensions of the various apartments of the temple, were laid bare by Prof. Diimichen in 1876, and after being copied were again covered up.

The deilori-route to unites with that from Reneh at Ram before (p. 75). Ropios early became an emporinin for many kinds of goods. InscripUons of the 81h Dyn. are found by the side of the old trade-route to the Red Sea at the Wadi J;lamll.mll.t (p. 16). In a tomb at Beniba8an belonging to Amenl, a princely official under the 12th Dyu., is an lnacription recording the treasures brought by Ameni to Roptos in the train of the crown-prince Usertesen. Roptos was the capital of the fifth nome of Upper Egypt, which bore two hawks on ita banner_ Its name appears in hieroglyphics &I (5 j 0 EtJbl and (5 .

The deUy chiefly worshipped here froin a very early period was Khem lIIin (Vol. I., p. 188), whose wife was called Isis, and son Horus. Osiris also had a burial-plaee here (Ha nub 'Gold houle'), in which a part of his body (called Kab) was p't88erveh. The book of magie, the search for which is narrated in the demotic romance of Setnau, was sunk in the Nile at Koptos. A medical leather-roll found at KOpto8, and now in the British .useum, il laid to have been written in the reign of Khufu or Cheopi (4th Dyu.). Koptol was fortified a8 early as the 12th Dynastn for the weallby city and eth route8 leading to it required to be defended against the warlike tribes who lurked between the Nile and the Arabian mountains, and who, even under the Roman emperors, were a source of danger. Guards were especially neeessary at this point, for there i8 no doubt that a con8iderable number of Phamician merchants had settled in Koptos at a very early date along with the Egyptians, and were engaged in importing the producta of Arabia, and at a later date even those of India, which were conveyed vii Arabia to the Egyptian Red Sea ports afterwards called Berenike and Leukos Limen and thence across the desed to the Nile. The green breceia, used for many buildings even under the Romans, was quarried at !;Iamimlt, on the desert-route to Koptol. It il even probable that Kebt-town or Keft-town means 'plaee of the Phmnicians't.. for the niciaDl were named Ken Or Raft in Egyptian. Strabo and pliny expressly state that the population of the town was mixed, containing both Egyptian and Arabic ('.e. Semitic) elementa. The hieroglyphic name of the town also occurs with the determ.inative-sign of the post ), which is only used after the names of foreign places or of 
placel in which foreigners were cOD.picuou.. The reports of Plutarch, lElian, ete., concerning the strange culta at Koptos farther indicate that a considerable Semitic community dwelt In the town, and was regarded with hostility by their ElgJltian nelghbou... lElian's .t&tement that the inhabitants of Koptos worshIpped the crooodile (Seth) and crucified the hawk (Horus) can only refer to these Semites. The true Egyptian. revenged themaelves by throwing an ass from a rock (as Plutareh narrates), bec,use Typhon (8eth) was red-haired and of the colour of an au. Red-haired men (and many red-haired Semites are represented on the monuments) were despised, and like all foreigners were stigmatized as 'Typhunic'. lIIany non-Egyptians are memorated at the .ides of the trade-route from the Red Sea to Knptos; name8 of Persian king8 are nowhere more n"merous. The camp of the Beduins, who hired their camels to the caravans and escorted them through the desert, must have anCiently existed within the circuit of the town. These Arabs appear to have been the instigators of a. great lneurreetion in Upper Egypt, which broke out under Dlocletian in 2112 A.D., and led to the .iege and -destruction of KOpt08. The town revived somewhat under the Khalifs, but flnaUy decayed with the gradual tran8ferenee of the Egyptian trade to the route from to About 7 M. above Koptos, 011 the E. 7*

According to Abulfeda (d. 1331) this town was second in size only to Fostat (Cairo), and was the chief centre of the Arabian trade. To-day heaps of ruins are the only remains. A few stones with fragmentary inscriptions have been built into the houses of the town; and the mosque contains a basin formed of a single stone, with the name of Ptolemy delphus upon it. A pylon, which stood here 30 years ago but has disappeared, bore a Greek inscription, announcing that 'Queen Cleopatra and King Ptolemy, the great gods and Philometors, and their children dedicated the temple to the god Arueris and to the deities worshipped along with him'. Ameris is the earlier Horus, usually identifled by the Greeks with Apollo, whence the name of the town Apollinopolis. The modern name J5.fl.s appears to be derived from Egyptian Near Benhur (E. bank), 00 3 M. to the S. of J5.fl.s, Prisse d'Avennes discovered the ruins of a small temple of Isis, in which the lJorus of Apolllnopolis, Min of Koptos, the triad ofThebes:(Ammon-Ra, Muth, and Khunsu), and other gods, were also worshipped.

The traveller who lands here near sunset on a Sunday or festival (recommended) will be pleasantly surprised to hear the sound of church-bells. The churches themselves are uninteresting. Great success has attended the labours of Christian missionaries here and still more in J5.dsj and a considerable proportion of the Coptic community (including the worthy and learned bishop of J5.lls) have embraced Protestantism. The missionaries of the United Presbyterian Church of North America have also had considerable success at Lnxor, Esneh, and other towns in Upper Egypt, their converts, however, being clUSively from among the Copts, never the Mohammedans. Demetrius II., patriarch of the Oopts (d. 1870),1 excommunicated both the converts and the missionaries. In 18ti6 he instigated a persecntion of the proselytes, whom he sought to terrify by flnes, stripes, and imprisonment j and he destroyed the publications of the missionaries (who have a printing-press of their own) wherever he could lay hands upon them. The British and American consula thereupon interfered energetically on behalf of their believers, and now the Coptic Protestants enjoy complete im)Jmnity from every form of religious persecution.

In 1824 it was the residence of ShAkh A\1med, and of 'Ali Kashef bftsh, who bravely defended it against the insurgents. -On the E. bank, about 31/2 M. from the river, lies the temple of Medamat. The ruins are not without interest, but it is better to visit them later from Luxor (p.161) if time permit, than to interrupt the ney so near Thebes. On the left bank, as we draw near Thebes, rise high limestone hills, presenting precipitous sides to the river, from which, however, they are separated by 
a strip of fertile land. The right bank is flatter, and the Arabian hills retreat farther into the distanoe. Before reaching the point where the W. chain projects a long curved mass of rock towards the river, we see to the left flrst the great obelisk, and the pylons of the temple of Karnak, half -by trees. When we clear the abrupt profile of theW. eli1Js and new formations are visible at its foot, we may catch a distant view of Luxor towards the S.E. None of the buildings on the W. bank are visible until the steamer has ascended as high as Karnak; then flrst the Colossi of Memnon and afterwards the Ramesseum come into view. The telegraph-posts and wires, which here obtrude themselves upon the view, seem strangely out of place beside the majeBtic relics of Egypt's golden period. As we gradually approach Luxor, we guish the flags flying above the white houses on the bank and from the consular dwellings, and the re'ts applies himself to flnd a suitable anchorage beside the other dhahabtyehs, which are always be found here. Those who desire to keep by themselves may flrst halt 011' tuxor, lay in provisions and other necessaries, visit Karnak, aud then land on the W. bank. In this case the re'is will probably raise objections, and the sailors (for whom a sheep should be bought, as they have tasted no meat Ion the voyage) prove mutinous, so that watchmen will be necessary. 9.

Rougl, Eludes des monuments du massif de Karnak, in the 'Melanges d'Archeologie egyptienne et .... yrlenne·. On each side of the Nile, here interrupted by three islands, stretches a wide belt of Certile land, bounded both on the E. and W. by ranges of hills, displaying a bolder and more definite mation than is usually the case with the mountains that flank the river-valley. On the E., the ridge, overtopped by finely shaped peaks, retires farther from the stream than on the W. The fertile strip ends as abruptly at the foot of the barrell limestolle-clift's as a lawn adjoining a gravel-walk in a garden. Most of the ed temples are situated ill the level district and are reached by the waters of the Nile when the illundatiom are at their highest; while the tombs are hewn in the flanks of the hills, where their dark openings are so numerous, that the E. slope of the Ubyan range might be aptly compared to a piece oC cork or to a honeycomb. Viewed from the river, the site of ancient Thebes presents the pearance of a wide mountain-girt basin or valley richly endowed with the gifts of never-failing fertility. Nature here revels in perpetual youth, while the most enormous edifices ever reared by mortal hand, though grey, desolate, and succumbing to the common fate of all human handiwork, yet compel the admiration of posterity for the wonderful race that has left such mighty memorials of its existence -memorials that have indeed been injured but not annihilated in the flight of thousands of years. The verdant orops and palms which everywhere cheer the traveller as soon as he has quitted the desert, the splendid hues that tinge the valley every morning and evening, the brilliant, unclouded sunshine that bathes every object in the winter season, and the inspiring feeling that every hour is enriching the imagination'with new and strange pictures, wholly prevents in Thebes the rise of that melancholy which so often 8tealS over the mind in presence of the relics of by-gone greatness and of vanished magnificence. The various monuments are situated as follows. On the right (E. bank) rises the Temple of Luxor, now occupied by dwellings, and to the N. are the immense ruins of Karnak, formerly connected with it. Beyond these monuments lay the streets of ancient Thebes. Farther to the N. is another extensive temple-site at Medamut, which must be regarded as occupying the site of a suburb of Thebes. On the left (W.) bank was the NecropoliB, with vaults in the rock and many mortuary temples. Each of these had its large annexe for the priesthood, schools, or libraries. The temples were adjoined by groves and lakes, and from ancient commercial contracts we gather that oue quarter of the citizens dwelt here. Nearer the mountains stood the houses of the embalmers, refuges for visitors to the necropolis, shops for the sale of numerous articies which the Egyptians were accustomed to bring as offerings to their ancestors, stables for the sarred animals, and slaughter-houses-lor the, cattle DigitIZed by \..:.Oogle

As the ancient pilgrim continued on his way towards the N. W. and crossed the hill of the cemetery now called el-Asasif, he came in sight of the roeky amphitheatre which enclosed the terraced precincts of the temple of Der el-Bal;ui. Northwards from a well-made route led to the valley of the Tombs of the Kings, now called Bibill1 el-Muliik, which could also be reached by a shorter though more fatiguing mountain-path from el-Asasif. Between the entrance of the valley of the Kings' Tombs and el-Asasif and close to the mountain lay the necropolis known as Drah Abu'l Neggah. Thence following the edge of the fertile strip towards the S. W. we reach the magnificent Ramesseum. Behind rises the mountain-ridge. The tombs on its E. slope, partly occupied as dwellings by the fella1}in, belong to the village now called Sh,'kh 'Abd As we gaze down upon the plain from the higher-lying graves, the Colossi of Memnon are conspicuous in the midst of the fertile belt. Behind these are the prominent ruins, known as K6m el-:Qetan, rising near the central point of an imaginary line connecting the Ramesseum with the temple of Medinet Habu, the magnificent Memnonium of Ramses III. Turning from Medinet Habu to the S.W., we reach a small temple of the Ptolemiesj to the N., near the mountains, lies the valley with the Tombs of the Queens j and Flirting the line of hills to the N.W. we reach the scanty remains of Murra'i, to the W. of which lies a valley with the small but interesting temple of Der el-Medineh. Two points are of special value for taking one's bearings. One is the summit of the mountain lying between el-Asasif and lIiblm el-Mulo.k j the other is the door of either of two tombs at Shekh 'Abd el-Kurnah. One of the tombs, in which Lepsius lived, is known to the guides as Lepsius j the other was inhabited by Ebers, who is remembered by the fella1}.in as Abu BUlos (Father of Paul). The name THEBES is probably the Greek form of the Egyptian f1 j 1 Uabu, with the feminine article t prefix.ed, i.e. Tuubu. 'l'heHellenes, familiar with the name Thebes which was borne by cities in Boootia, Attica, T.hessaly, Cilicia, near Miletus in Asia Minor, etc., believed that in Tuabu they had met it once more. Possibly, however, the name may be derived from the words n 0 0 apt am, which were applied to the temples on the E. oJJ111 bank at least. Among the·Greeks the town was known as a translation of Pa-umen, city of Ammon, also called Dioapolis Megal.e or DioBpolia Magna to distinguish it from Diospolis Parva or Ilou (p. 70).

106 Route 9. THEBES. Hi3tOf't/o of which tombs have been found, is open to question. Hardly any traces of earlier monuments have been discovered. The earliest prosperity of Thebes dates from the eclipse of the first ing period of Memphis. Previously it was named the southern On, in distinction to Heliopolis, the northern On. A legend, known to us, however, only from inscriptions of a later date, narrates that Osiris was born here. Such a myth can scarcely have been invented in later times, for from the beginning of the New Empire onwards, Osiris fell into a position quite subsidiary to the other gods of Thebes, especially to Ammon-Ra with whom Muth and Khunsu formed a triad. Only in connection with the worship of the dead did Osiris retain his leading rank. Among goddesses a Hathor seems to have enjoyed especial honour from the earliest times; and even till a paratively late date the nome PhathYf'itea (the Pathros of the Bible), of which Thebes was the flourishing oapital, was called after her the 'Hathor district'. Under the early empire the afterwards gigantic city was not conspicuous. It is seldom mentioned, and even under the 13th Dyn. Assiu!-Lycopolis (p. 31) is described as the chief town of Upper Egypt. When the Hyksos invaded the Nile valley, the legitimate princes, who had ruled from the Mediterranean to the Cataracts, were driven to the south. Here they reigned during several inglorious centuries, until Raskenen and King Aahmes (p. XXXI) arose and under the banner of Ammon of Thebes expelled the strangers. 'I'he ing princes, won important victories not only on Egyptian soil but also in Asia, always fighting under the auspices of Ammon with whom was joined the Ra of Lower Egypt, and who, as we have seen (Vo!.L, p. 138), was speedily placed at the head of all the national gods. The liberation of the country was directed from Thebes, and that city continued for centuries to be the favourite seat of the Pharaohs, and the reservoir into which flowed the untold treasures exacted as tribute or brought as booty from Asia to Egypt. A large share of this wealth was bestowed npon Ammon. The magnificent and gigantic temple, erected at this period to the god, is still one of the chief sights of Thebes. The grandees of the kingdom esteemed it an honour to become priests of Ammon, the schools beside his temples flourished, and the kings offered their richest gifts to this god, from whom they expected a snrer fulfilment of their petitions than from any other. Thus Thebesbecame the city of Ammon, the No or No-Amon of ture and the Dioapolis of the Greeks. Victory over foes was the burden of of the Pharaohs at this cnlminating period of Thebes, and the warriors led out by the monarchs were drilled under the eye of the god. In the introductory remarks on the history of Egypt mention has already been made of the great warrior-princes who placed Thebes at the zenith of its fame, and in the description of the various monuments reference will again be made to them. Here it may be added that the fame of the huge city early reached the ears even of the Greeks. In a possibly interpolated passage of the DigitIZed by Coogle

Hi3tory. THEBES. 9. Route. 107 Iliad (IX, 379-384), Achilles, enraged with Agamemnon, assures Ulysses that he will never more unite in council or in deed with the great Atrides: -"Ten times as much, and twenty times were vain; the high pH'd store" "Of rich Hycenll', and it he ransack wide earth for more," "Seareh old Orchomenus for gold, and by the fertile stream" "Where, in Egyptian Thebes, the heaps of precious ingots gleam," "The hundred-gated Thebes, where twice ten score in martial state" "Of valiant men wilh steeds and ears march through each massy gate." (Black/." Tramla/ion.) The epithet i.e. 'hundred-gated', here used by Homer, was also applied by later classical authors to Thebes. Diodorus, Strabo, Pliny, and nato of Sinope all make use of it, referring, however, to the pylons of the temples in the capital of Upper Egypt. With the rising importance of the god and with the increase of his wealth, of which they had the disposal, the archpriests of Ammon gradually grew to regard themselves as the chief persons in the state; and, after the way had been prepared by a series of weak princes, they succeeded in usurping the throne and by their rule prepared the ruin of Egyptian power. From the 20th Dyn. onwards, Thebes began to decay. Ramses Ill. indeed adorned the left bank especially with elaborate buildings j but his immediate successors did no more than hew out for themselves deep and richly carved graves in the valley of the Kings' Tombs, and the princes of Lower Egypt who succeeded the priests of Ammon of the 21st Dyn. were the less able to bestow attention upon Thebes, the more eagerly they strove to adorn their homes in the Delta with gorgeous tures. Yet even these princes did not wholly abandon Thebes, and they did not omit to inscribe pretentious reports of their mighty a,ctsen the walls of the temple of Ammon. The armies of the rians penetrated as far as Thebes and plundered it; the Ethiopians planted their rule here and honoured Ammon with buildings and inscriptions; the princes of the 26th did for Sais what the princes of the 18th and 19th Dyn. had done for the city of Ammon, but they also paid their homage to the great god of Thebes by erecting smaller buildings there. The invading army of Cambyses ascended as far as Upper Egypt, but seems to have done little or no damage at Thebes. INectanebus I., one of the native

It may be easily conjectured that these, formerly the chief among the citizens or Egypt, bore but ill the fate which now placed them far behind the Alexandrians. Strangers sat on the throne of Ra, and cared not to take the trouble to visit in person the remote Diospolis, the coronation-town of the Pharaohs, who had been accustomed to make a triumphal entry after each victory and to offer thanks to Ammon. The earlier noble Lagidae were ceeded by worthless rulers, whose extravagant tastes forced them to drain the resources of the Thebaid and other provinces. der the gluttonous Euergetes II. and his consort Cleopatra Cocce the Alexandrians rose in revolt and expelled Alexander I., the king's son. The citizens of the capital of Upper Egypt dared also' to rise in the attempt to win back their lost independence i and they refused to lay, down their arms even when Ptolemy Soter II. (Lathyms) was recalled from banishment by the Alexandrians and was universally recognized in Lower Egypt. The army of Lathyms besieged the town, whose inhabitants bravely defended themselves in the huge temples, each of which served as a fortress. Finally, however, Thebes was stormed i its treasures were plundered and its venerable monuments tenibly mutllated. Thenceforward Thebes is only mentioned as a goal of inquisitive travellers, who under the Roman emperors were attracted to the Nile by two monuments in particular -the pyramids and the musical colossus of Memnon oil the W. bank at Thebes. Diodorus (60 B.C.) and Strabo (24B.O.) describe Thebes as it was after the destruction. 'rhe latter found only a few relics on each side of the Nile, just as the traveller of to-day does. An earthquake, no common occunence in Egypt, had done more than the hand of the fierce warrior to destroy the monuments of thousands of years. In 27 or 24 B.C. a convulsion of this nature wrought such havoc that EURebim declared, though not without exaggeration, that the Egyptian Thebes had been levelled with the ground. In the absence of some such natural torce, ,we should be tempted to declare that the annihilation of many parts of the monuments of Thebes must have been a task only less difficult than their construction. At many points, ally in the temple at Karnak, the injury is plainly to be ascribed to human hands. The representations, dating from the period of the Ptolemies, within the second main pylon, to the left as we proach the large hypostyle hall, have been removed with axes or hammers. Some smaller injuries, especially to the names of the kings, were due to political reasons, as when Tutmes m., after he obtained the sole power, destroyed the cartouehes of his too tious sister and guardian i others are to be ascribed to the evil habit of certain Pharaohs of appropriating the monuments of their decessors by substituting their own names for those of the real builders i and yet others had religious causes, as wb.eJI the pame of DigitIZed by L.oogle

The introduction of ianity and the edicts of Theodosius were followed by the tion of many pagan statues and the obliteration of mauy pagan scriptions. At all events the new religion and the closing of the temples dedicated to the ancient gods removed all possibility of anything being done to preserve the monuments of the Pharaohs. The Nile, which annually overflowed as far as the temple of Karnak in particular, and the saline exudations of the soil, wrought harm; jackals and other animals sought shelter in the subterranean bers; many tombs, at first occupied by Christian hermits, were verted into peasants' dwellings; Christian churches were erected in the temple-halls, and houses were built between the columns of the temple at Luxor. Carefully hewn blocks and slabs were removed from the monuments, which were used as quarries, and many limestone details were thrown into the furnace and reduced to lime. Whither the enormous population of the hundred-gated Thebes betook itself is unknown. A few widely-scattered villages alone now represent of the giant city. These have given names to the various edifices and tombs, whose holy names might only be uttered with pious awe in the time of the Pharaohs. The ruins of Thebes remained long forgotten. On the revival of learning classical students recalled their fame; Pococke rediscovered, described them and drew them; and finally the publications of the great French Expedition revealed to astonished Europe how much of the ancient magnificence of the Pharaohs had survived to our time. Each succeeding scientific expedition made its longest halt here and found here its richest rewards. The names of Champollion, kinson, Lepsius, and other Egyptologists are familiar words on the .ite of ancient Thebes; and Mariette, who carried on excavations under the:auspices of the Khedive, must also be mentioned.

The PRINCll'AL PYLON is easily recognized by the obelisks and colossi at its portal. Tbe visitor who places himself in front of this perceives at once that rubbish and earth conceal one-halfor the sloping which is richly adorned with carvings and inscriptions now sadly damaged. Like all pylons, the one before us consists of two truncated pyramids with an trance-door between them. The latter was 05 ft. in height. The towers, which rose about 20 ft. higher, were crowned with an gant concave cornice, which has now almost completely disappeared, and were framed with the astraga!. The entrance -door is pletely ruined. Under the cornice is a conspicuous Inscription in large letters, which may be traced also on the architrave of the peristyle court, wherever it has remained visible and entire. This inscription contains a dedication, intimating that Ramses II. built this imposing edifice for 
his father Ammon-Ra, the king of the Gods. On each side of the entrance were two monolithic Colossi, 40 ft. in height; the most easterly has disappeared, the three others are half-buried in rubbish. In front of the central figures, though qnite symmetrically placed, rose two Obelisks of pink granite, one of which (the W.) now adorns the Place de la corde at Paris. It is to be hoped that a crack, which has been noticed in the monument from the days of antiquity, will not lead to its destruction under the infiuence of a northern climate. This W. obelisk was smaller than its E. neighbour which is still ing j and the ancient architects endeavoured to counteract this equality by giving the smaller obelisk a higher base than the other, and placing it a little farther forward. The inscriptions on the obelisk still standing at Luxor are cleady and finely cut in the stone and are perfectly legible. They name Ramses the Pharaoh, with many pretentious titles, as the founder of this gorgeous building erected in honour of Ammon in southern Thebes (Apt res). The faces of these obelisks, like those of most others, are slightly vex, as the priestly architects observed that a fiat surface was apt to appear concave in a strong light. Details supplied by the French engineers give a vivid idea of the enormous weight that had to. be handled in the erection of an obelisk, although the Paris obelisk is comparatively small; considerably larger obelisks are to be seen at Karnak. Tbe W. obelisk of Luxor is 75 ft. high, its base is 7112 ft:. square, and its weight is upwards of 212 tons. The exterior walls of the pylons of nearly every Egyptian temple are adorned with representations referring to victories granted by the gods of the sanctuaries to the royal builders.

The king is here represented in his camp. He has dismounted from his chariot, which waits for him, and has seated himself upon his throne. His officers await his instructions, and farther in the background the troops rest in their camp. The inscriptions are much injured, but it can be made out from them that they were graven in the stone chietly in honour of Ramses II. 's victory over the Kheta (Aramlilans) and their allies. In the 5th year of the king, on the 9th Payni, the tress of Katesh on the Orontes was stormed. The river and the contest on its banks are still distiuguishable. The Epic of Pentaur in 90 vertical lines, covers the lower part of tbe W. wing and part of the E. wing j some of it has recently been uncovered, the rest is still concealed by rubbish. This poem was the national epos, the Diad, of the ancient Egyptians. It occurs twice on the E. bank !It Thebes -on the N. side of the pylon at Luxor and on the S. side of the temple of Karnak (here also partly concealed by earth). It is also found, though in a very fragmentary condition, on the N. wall of the temple of Ramses II. at Abydos (discovered first by lohr) , and in the most complete (hieratic) form in the Papyrus Raifd (now in the Louvre) and the Papyrus Saltier 111. (now in the British Museum). The poetic text on the pylons at Luxor is followed by a prose text, dealing mainly with the arrival of two hostile spies, who gave out at first that the Kheta had fled into the land of Khirabu bon or Aleppo) to the N. of Tunep, but who on being scourged vealed the real lurking-place of the enemy to the N.W. of Katesh. The king hastily recalled the Egyptian troops, but too late to vent his camp being suddenly attacked on the S. by the Kheta. The Egyptians were surrounded, and only the personal bravery of the king secured the final victory. This prose inscription, preserved in full at the Ramesseum and in the temple of Abu-Simbel, describes the same event as the poem ofPentaur, though it dates it a month later. The most important and /lnest episodes according to the restoration of the text by E. de Rlluge are as follows. 'Then the miserable and worthless Kheta with his nnmerous allies lay hidden behind the fortress of Katesh. His majesty found himself alone (with hi. servante). The legion of Ammon marched after him; the legion of Ra passed through the valley to the S. of the fortress of Shabtun and marched forwards . .

Ead BafIk colossi, and the various subsidiary details, is still not unimposing; and the whole entrance to the temple at Luxor Is unusually tllresque, perhaps on account of the very abundance of small details which are unrestrainedly placed here side by side with the huge and dignified. Beyond the principal pylon was the GreatPeriatyle Court (Pl. A), which was entirely surrounded by a double row of columns (twelve pairs on each of the four sides). It measures 18j ft. in length and 167 ft. in breadth. This hall was at one time completely built up, but the W. side at least has now been laid bare. The most recent tions have revealed a portico, dating from Ramses II., on the inner side of the N.W. wall of the court. The architectonic purport of this portico, which is somewhat lower than the court and has three clustered columns, is not apparent. Between the inner row of lumns on the S. side of the court arrows and shields of Rarnses II. were placed. A mosque situated within this court prevents the cavation of the E. wall, and considerably mars the general eiJect. Ramses II. founded the court, but the Ethiopian Sabato wrote his name on the portal, while Ptolemy Philopator wrote his on several of the abaci. On the S. side this court was terminated by a smaller Pylon, beyond which, though not with the same axis (see above), is a ColoJID.ade (Pl. B), 08 yds. long, buUt under the 18th Dynasty. The last is in tolerably good preservation and contributes essentially to the dignifled appearance of the ruins of Luxor when viewed from the river-bank or still more from the island crossed on the way to visit the monuments of W. Thebes. Seven couples of columns, nearly 42 ft. in height, with calyx-capitals, still support a heavy architrave above a lofty abacus. The whole was built by hotep II!., but King Horus, Seti I., and Seti II. have also recorded their names upon it. The marvellous play of colour showll by this colonnade with its deep, heavy shadows when the setting sun sheds a rosy light upon the E. sky, is nowhere excelled. The Second Periatyle Court (Pl. 0) had double rows of columns on its N., E., and W. sides. These, belonging to the order of sculptured bud columns, are specially eiJective as seen from the river-bank. The court was 48 yds. long and{il) yds. broad, and ends in allYflO"' style Hall (Pl. D), the roof of which was borne by 32 sculptured bud-columns arranged in 4 rows of 8. The two sphinxes at the trance bear the name of Sebekhotep 11. (13th Dyn.). This hall was barely 20 yds. deep and 30 yds. wide, and for some unexplained reason its E. wall forms an acute angle (instead of a right angle) with the S. wall of the preceding peristyle conn. The Opm Space (PI. E), whieh we next find, Is entered from the river side, and is specially commended to the traveller's attention.

Beyond this space weI'e the series of chambers forming the Sanctuary. now accessible only from the side next the river. This is certainly the most ancient part of the temple, and unusually clearly-cut hieroglyphics inform us that it was built by the same monarch who reared the Colossi ofMemnon, i.e. by Amenhotep III. The first Room (PI. F), with four columns, contains a series of presentations of homage and sacrifice before Ammon Generator, and in the chamber to the E. of it (pl. n) are represented the finement of the mother of the king (Mut-em-ua) and the nursing of the infant Amenhotep. Beyond Room F is the Holy of Hoties (Pl. G). It is doubtful whether Assyrians or Persians destroyed the original sanctuary, but at all events after the Macedonians had conquered Egypt and after the death of Alexander the Great, it was restored in the name of Alexander II., for whom Ptolemy Soter I. ruled as 'satrap'. Alexander boasts in the dedicatory inscription of ing restored the work of Amenhotep. The last rooms of this part of the temple ha'fe now also been excavated, and contain various fine sculptures of the 18th Dynasty. Ammon of Thebes, especially in his ithyphallic form as the productive power, appears everywhere as the chief deity of the temple, receiving sacrifices and bestowing gifts. In the chamber adjoining the last square hall traces have been found of a staircase ascending to the roof of the temple. 11. Xarnak.

Next to the Tombs of the Kings, Karnak is by far the most teresting part of ancient Thebes. Even under the Pharaohs the group of temples here was considered the most striking creation of an age peculiarly famous for architectural achievements. Centuries have here destroyed much, yet there is no other building in the world that can match 
the dimensions of the temple of Ammon at Karnak.

These two avenues were connected with each other by a third cross-avenue of sphinxes. We follow the left (W.) avenue, the fianking sphinxes of which are ca"ed in' the grand style and are placed close to each other. Between the legs of each is a statuette with the name of Amenhotep III. (Ra-ma-neb). This leads us to the handsome but almost too slender Pylon XII, erected by Ptolemy III. Euergetes I., with a winged sun-disc in the casement, with boldly-spread pinions.

at Thebe,. KARNAK. 11. Route. 119 The Architectonic Feature, of the court must be noticed before we proceed to examine its uses. It is 275 ft. deep and 338 ft. wide, and covers an area of 9755 sq.yds. On each a kind of colonnade or stoa is formed by a row of columns and the exterior wall. Eighteen columns still stand on the left side, but the row on the right was terrupted by Ramses III., wbo has here p13ced a temple (Pl. 0), jecting considerably beyond the S. wall, and at right angles to it. Both rows of columns are unsculptured. Another small temple (pl. B) was built in the N.E. angle of the court by Seti II. Merenptah. Both of these smaller temples are later additions, with no reference to the purpose of the court, and they interfere with the effect designed by the original builder. The double row of huge columns in front of the doorway of the second pylon was, on the other hand, part of the original plan. The lofty shafts, which were terminated by capitals of gigantic proportions, taper towards the top, and contract rapidly immediately above the convex bases on which they stand. The calyx of the capitals was surrounded with petals, from amidst which slender marsh-plants sprang. In the centre of each was a cubical abacus, serving as a pedestal for an image of a god. Mariette conjectured that a small hypmthral temple (like that at Philae) stood in front of the second pylon, and that not only was there an tional (sixth) pair of columns adjoining the others but that the vaulting of the whole was rendered possible by two central columns between the pairs at each end which are about 36 ft. apart. As, however, there is not the faintest trace of these conjectural six columns, it is perhaps more probable that this colonnade sents a processional or triumphal avenue, formerly covered only by a velarium, and that the continuation of it is to be recognized in the elevated central row of columns in the hypostyle hall (p. 126). Of the original columns only llve can now be traced on the left side, and one on the right, close to the second pylon, which nates the peristyle on the E. Three still show about '/s of the original height, one about 1/4, and another about '/2; the only plete column is on the right. Upon this last Psammetikh I., of the 26th Dyn., has placed his name over that of the Ethiopian Taharka, of the 25th Dyn.; above, on the abacus, is the name of Ptolemy IV. Philopator, which also appears on the recently excavated base of one of the broken columns. The shatt is composed of 36 courses of carefully hewn stone, the capital of 5 courses. The height is 69 ft.; the greatest breadth of the capital 16 ft., the circumference at the top 49 ft. -The above-mentioned second pylon, on the E. side of the court, is mostly in ruins. Before the doorway is an ber (Pl. b), the entrance to which was flanked by two statues of Ramses II. The IIgure on the left side has fallen down; that on the right, broken at the top, displays excellent workmansbip, especlally in the legs, and recalls the Daed alian ligures of the earliest periods of Greek art.

120 Boute 11. KARNAK. &at Bank We may mention here in anticipation that the roof of the ing hypostyle hall was supported by a perfect forest of papyrus-bud columns, ·through the midst of which a broad passage was marked by calyx-columns, closely resembling the detached paire of columns in the lirst court (comp. p. 126). At this point we Ilrst obtain a clear idea of the arrangement of this portion of the temple, and the same remark applies also to all the rooms between it and the tuary. It should also be remembered that the number of those privileged to follow and behold the procession gradually decreased from room to room as the sanctuary was approached. Headed by the king or chief priest, the crowd of priests, bearing the standards, symbols, and images of the gods, passed through the doorway of the Ilrst pylon into the peristyle court. The double row of capitals served at once to indicate their passage and to mark the limits beyond which the pious spectators must not press. The sacred procession rolled on slowly beneath the shade of the velarium and entered the hypostyle hall through the second pylon. Many of those who were permitted to enter the Ilrst court had there to quit the procession and to take up their positions to the right and left of the calyx-columns. Others again were not permitted to advance farther than the hypostyle, and so with each room until the tuary was reached. To this day the clearly defined passage thither may be traced, and it will be observed that at each successive stage the place appointed for those who had to quit the procession is smaller than the preceding. LATBR ADDITIONS IN TUB PBBISTYLJI COURT. 1. The Small Temple of SeU II. Xereaptah (Pl. B), in the N.E. angle of the court, to our left as we enter by the Ilrst pylon. This building, which has only recently been made partly acceseible, is built of grey sandstone, except beside the three doors, where a reddish quartzose sandstone :has been used. The Ilgure of the god Seth has everywhere been erased from the name otthe builder. Only a small portion of the walls is entirely sculptured; and the presentations that are still extant show that the temple was dedicated to the Theban triad, Ammon, Muth, and Khunsu. In the chamber entered by the W. (lett) door appears the sacred boat of the goddess Muth, to whom Seti Merenptah, accompanied by his sou, offers a libation. The richly dressed boy is called 'royal priuce' and 'heir to the crowu'. Adjacent is the lIgure· of the helmeted Pharaoh, presenting the image of the goddess of truth to Ammon and Khunsu. 2.

The building is in form a complete temple, but in view of the enormous dimensions of its surroundings can claim only the racter of a chapel. Its total length is 170 ft. The Pylon with the entrance door is much injured, especially at the top. Beyond it is a PerWyle Court (PL Il), with eight Osiris-pillars on each side, and at the end four caryatide pillars forming a Pa8.age (pt whence a door leads to a small Hypo.tyle (PL 1), with eight papyrus-bud pitals. Finally come the chambers of the 81lf1ctuary (Pl. 6). ture is not wanting in this temple, which owes its origin to the wealthy founder of the Memnonium at Medinet Habn (p. 174). This most lavish of Egyptian kings had already founded within tlie limits of the temple of Ammon the temple of Khunsu (p. 148) as a worthy symbol of his liberality to the gods; and that fact explains the comparative smallness of the temple before us. The exterior of the pylons was adorned with representations expressing the gratitude of the Pharaoh to the god for victory in battle. On the Left WiRg (E.) Ramsesll1., wearing the crown of Upper Egypt 4, holds a band of prisoners by the hair and raises his sword for a blow which must strike off all their heads at once. Ammon, standing in front of him, hands him the sword of victory, and delivers to him chained together the representatives of the vanquished peoples, who appear in three rows. In the first two rows are the conquered nations of the south, in the third row those of the north. On the Right Wing are similar representations, the king here wearing the crown of Lower Egypt V. In the doorway, Ramses III. reeeives from Ammon the symbol of life, etc. On the right side-wall of the pylons are representations of battles and captives, which were concealed by the colonnade, a conclusive proof that the circumference of the court cannot date from Ramses II. In the peristyle court (fl. II) the following inscription occurs on the architrave of the caryatid passage on the right. (We omit the lengthy Introductory titles of the king.)

t 22 Route 11. KARNAK. Ea.t BaM The lower parts, especially in the sanctuary-chambers, are covered with rubbish. A 10llg List of Offerings on the left (E.) exterior wall is of some interest. It records that Ramses III., in the month Payni in the 1Qth year of hisreign, decreed that gifts for his father Ammon-Ra, the king of the gods, should be laid upon the silver altar, such as provisions, sacrificial cakes, etc. Then follow some details (injured) as to the amount of the offerings. 3. The Portique des Bubaatitee (Portico ofth.e BubtUtitu; Pl. a), so called by Champolllon, is the part of the court between the left (E.) wall of the temple just described and the S. part (i.e. the thest to the right) of the second pylon. This space, only 43 ft. wide, had a door admitting to the temple from the S., and is to be regarded as the E. end of the colonnade which lined the S. wall of the court. Two un sculptured papyrus -bud columns divide it from the rest of the court. Numerous inscriptions dating from the 22nd Dyn., which originated in Bubastis, cover the walls, and contain tant material for the history of that period. This dynasty succeeded the inglorious line of priest-kings, who seized the tIlrone of Thebes after the self-indulgent rulers of the 20th dynasty. Their names are rather Semitic than Egyptian, a circumstance that need cause no surprise when we remember that Bubastis is named as their home, a city in the E. part of the Delta which was settled by Semitic tribes. As their names appear to be of Aramaic origin it is not impossible that they were placed upon the throne of the Pharaohs by the Assyrian conquerors who are mentioned in the cuneiform inscriptions of Mesopotamia, though the Egyptian hieroglyphics ignore them. Like their predecessors of the 21st Dyn., they retained the chief priesthood in their own control, apparently by committing this of lice to their heirs. In the hall in which we now are the king appears several 
times with the crown-prince, who is named 'IIrst prophet of Ammon-Ra'; and the crown -prince occurs also without his father. Sheshenk I. probably began the decoration of the building, for his name appears in the usual place for the dication-inscription; i.e. on the architrave above the columns. The names of Osorkon I; and Takelut I. also occur. The last-named king appears before Ammon-Ra accompanied by his son Osorkon, clad in the priestly panther-skin j and Osorkon also occurs alone offering sacrillce to Ammon. On the E. wallis a double painting representing Ammon to the right and left, wearing the crown and seated on a throne, while the deceased son of the same Osorkon approaches in priestly garb to offer sacrillce. Beneath is a long but unfortnnately damaged inscription, dating from the 12th year of Takelut II., which mentions a remarkable event said to have occurred in the reign of the father of that prince (probably Sheshenk II.).

In the left wing, on the N. waIl, Ammon appears presenting Osorkon I. with the notched statt of years and the sword of victory; beneath, the king drinks the milk of life from the breast of Hathor; and adjacent is kon as a youth with the crown, to whom Khnum hands the symbol of life. Before proceeding on our way towards the sanctuary, we must inspect a most important historical monument which owes its origin to Sheshenk I. (the Shi8hak of the Bible), founder of the dynasty of the Bubastites. This is on the outside of the S. Wall of the temple of Ammon, and Is easily found. Issuing from the doorway of the Portico of the Bubastites, we tum to the left, and immediately find ourselves in front of this important representation. The massive form of the king, wearing the double crown, appears brandishing his weapon over a band of foes with pointed beards, who raise their arms In supplication. Farther to the left is the large figure of Ammon, with the double feather on his head, grasping in his right hand the sword of victory and in his left cords binding five rows of captives with n labels. }'oes with pointed beards kneel before him and beg for mercy with uplifte i hands. The portrait of King Sheshenk was left ed, the outline drawing of the crown being stilI visible on the stone. His cartouche and the inscriptions placed in his and Ammon's mouth are more distinct. Eeneath Ammon appears the goddess of Thebes with the symbol of the nome of the city of Ammon l upon her head. In her left hand she holds a bow and arrow, in her right a battIe-axe and six papyrus cords, which unite ftve rows of names of towns. surmounted by busts. These are the names of places besieged and captured by Sheshenk In his campaign against Rehoboam, and we have thus a collateral corroborationofihe Biblical narrative, such as has not been found for any other portion of the Old Testament. 'rhe Biblical pallagea are as foJlows: 1 Kings XIV., 26-26: 'And it came to pas, in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem: And he took away the treasuras of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's houle; he even took away all; and to took away aJl the shields of gold whIch Solomon had made'. 2nd ehron.

Its breadth (inside measurement) is 838 ft., its depth 170 ft., and its area 6450 square yards, an area spacious enough to accommodate the entire church of Notre Dame at Paris. The roof is supported by 134 columns, of which the central row is higher than the others. Each of the 12 columns in this row is 113/11 ft. in diameter and upwards of 32 ft. in circumference, i.e. as Hypos.lyle Hall of Karnak.

The carvings and hieroglyphics placed by Ramses II. are much illferior to those dating from the reign of his. father Seti I., a fact we have already noticed at Abydos. By far the most important place among the gods here is filled by Ammon, Muth, and Khunsu, the Theban triad (Vol. I., p.138). At Karnak Ammon was conceived of in two capacities, which must be distinguished from each other j he was ill the first place Ammon Generator, in the secolld place Ammon-Ra, the king of the gods. Ammon may be identified by his feather-crown, Khunsu oy the crescent on his head and the lock on his temples, and Muth lly the vulture-cap. The other gods that appear with them m.ay be easily identified with the help of the introduction on the Religion of Ancient Egypt (Vol. I., p. 124). On the architrave are some clearly cut inscriptions, of which a few deviate from the usual formulae. One of these, dating from Seti 1'1 on the architrave above the columns in the first cross-row to the E. (right), is as follows: 'He is a king, mounting his hone like the son ofIsis (Horus). He is an archer of a mighty arm and like the (god of war) Mentu a great wall of brass. He is the protector of his soldiers, when they thirst in the hollow way, on the day of battle. No opposition is offered to him from the hundred thousand brave hearts that are united in one place'.

Wall the reliefs are in two divisions, an upper and a lower. The series begins at the top, to the left ofthe beholder. Here we see King Seti alighting from his chariot, in a well-wooded country belonging to the tribes of the Remenen (Armeniana) and Retennu (SYrians). These are compelled to fell trees, which are' leafy and seem to be tall and slender; and were probably to be used for sbip-building (as Solomon used the trees felled by the people of Hiram) or for fiag-staffs. The physiognomies of the Asiatics are distinctly characterized. The fortress appearing behind the horse is named 'Katbar to the N. ofHenuma'. In the representation below the king is shown driving in his chariot above the slain. Beside the horses, which drew the king on state occasions, are their names j the king's favourite horse is here called 'Victory in Thebes'.-The Tema en pa Kanana, the fortress Kanana, is overcome. This was Seti's first great exploit, which he performed, as the inscription informs us, in the first year of his reign, when he overthrew the Shasu, the Semitic neighbours of Egypt from Zar (Pelusium) to the fortress of Kanana (Canaan). 'His majesty was towards them as a turious lion. They were transformed to corpses, hewn down in their blood within their valleys'. Confused heaps of slain appear below the fortress (to the left). An Asiatic, with a hat, prays with upraised hands for mercy j several fall pierced with arrows. Only one escapes from among ten thousand to proclaim in distant lands the bravery of the king.-We now reach the N. Wall, where also there is an upper and a lower series of representations. In the first scene (to the extreme left), above, the army has penetrated far enough to storm the fortress of Nillila(Nineveh), in the land of the Chaldaeans. The stream which washes the stronghold is the Tigris. The inhabitants of 
the country, who are represented full face what awkwardly and contrary to the usual Egyptian method, conceal themselves among trees. The king, advancing to the attack in his chariot (his head and that of his galloping horse have been broken off) seizes two of them standing in their chariot, and shoots arrows against the mounted foes.

In the corresponding scenes in the lower row the king appears in his chariot (at the left end of the N. wall), with his back turned to the great ones of the Khara (Syrians). He drives past several castles, built by himself, some of them described as water-stations; beside the lower ones is a small fresh-water lake. In the second scene the king is shown in his chariot, shooting 
arrows against his foes, who are named IShasu' (Beduins). Fortified water-stations appear here also and a beacon or watch-tower of King Ramenma. The following representation is one of the most remarkable in Egypt, for it clearly proves that a kind of Suez Canal, i.e. a canal dividing Africa from Egypt, existed as early as the time of Seti I. The relief represents the king on his homeward journey. His spirited horses prance along before the light chariot, which carries only the Pharoah and the heads of his slain enemies. (The king's favourite horse is named 'Ammon gives the sword'.) In his left hand the king holds the reins and his bow, and in his right the sword of victory, the scourge, and a number of cords to which pinioned enemies are fastened. Three of the latter he drags after him, and three rows of Asiatics fastened together by the neck precede the horses. The bastions with reservoirs which the procession has to pass are represented at the foot of the relief, in accordance with the peculiar Egyptian system of perspective. The desert-station diately beside the hind hoofs of the king's horses is called Migdol of King Ramenma. (Migdol is a Semitic word meaning a fortified tower generally.) Between the hind and forelegs of the horses appears another fortress, called the castle of the lions. The train of ing warriors is separated from their Egyptian fatherland by a canal full of crocodiles. That this is not merely an arm of the Nile is dicated by an inscription above the bridge, to the right, which names it Ta lenat, i.e. literally 'the cutting'. The crocodiles, which do not live iu salt water, show that this canal was supplied from the Nile; and the two groups of figures on the farther bank show that it marked the boundary of Egypt. In the upper group are priests and grandees, with curions nosegays in their hands, who await the Pharaoh with low obeisances; in the lower group the women raise their hands in greeting to the retnrning king, who brings with him their husbands and sons. The inscription runs: 'The priests, the great ones, and the princes of Upper and Lower Egypt approach to welcome the good god (i.e. the king) on his turn from the Syrian land, with enormous booty. Never has the like happened since the time of the god', i.e. probably sillce the time of Ra. -The 'cutting' which thus divided Asia and Africa can only be the canal by means of which the early Pharaohs deavoured to unite the Nile with the Red Sea (comp.

B.O.) and at a later period by Darius I. Oommunication between the Nile and the Red Sea was' maintained even under the Arabs, but it was afterwards interrupted, and not restored until the construction of the present fresh-water canal by Lesseps. The bastions which defended it are those that compelled the Jews during the Exodus to change their N.E. route at Etham or Etam, i.e. the fortified places (khetem), and to turn towards the Red Sea on the S. The relief, which is gradually becoming more and more indistinct, deserves careful study. The conqueror of the Semites, who is here joyfully welcomed as he approaches in his chariot, is the ancestor of the Pharaoh of the Bible narrative who perished in the Red Sea. The victorious monarch next appears, after his arrival at Thebes. As in the upper representation, he conducts to Ammon two rows of rebellious Asiatic princes, captured in the land of the Retennu, and presents to the god magnificent vessels. We have now returned to the door by which we left the style hall. It is adorned with the name of Ramses the Great. 1.'0 the right and left are two colossal companion reliefs, in which Ammon is represented holding several rows of captives by cords, and presenting the weapons of victory to King Seti, who raises his sword against a band of foes whom he holds by the hair. The name-rings on both sides refer to the conquered tribes. The legend on the relief to the left is noteworthy: 'He smites the great ones of the Annu Mentau (with the symbols ofthe shepherds), all the remote regions, all lands , the Fenekhu (Phamicians) of the sea-region, the Sati, the great circle of the green ocean' (i.e. the Mediterranean Sea). We turn next to the representation on the RIGHT (W.) SIDB of the door. To the extreme right, 
at the corner of Pylon II., above, we see the storming of Katesh in the land of Amara (tho Amorites). This is the fortress which offered such serious resistance to the army of Tutmes TIl., and it was the greatest obstacle to the victorious progress of the Egyptian army in the wars of Seti and his son Uamses. The scene is depicted with great vividness. The Aramaic foes of the king (the Kheta) appear both on foot and in chariots; and Seti overcomes his foes fighting also on foot and in his chariot. The foes, who wear curious peaked hoods, Dee in wild confusion. The Egyptian artist here shows some appreciation of landscape effects. A forest region is represented, though somewhat crudely, with six different kinds of trees and shrubs. A herd of cattle longing to the Kheta, terrified by the approach of the king, Dy from their pasture, accompanied by the herdsmen, who toss their arms in despair. Katesh is taken, and the defenders are thrown from the walls. This is the only relief that has been preserved in the upper row . DigitIZed by Coogle

Next the king on foot deals the 1I.nishing blow with his lance to an of1lcer, who has been brought to his knees. To the left the victorious monarch fares homeward, preceded by two rows of prisoners, named '\Ii anta en tabi'. The small 1I.gure behind the chariot is the crown-prince Ramses.

'fhis part of the temple has been terribly destroyed, but enough has been left standing to alford an idea of the general arrangement. The picturesque elfect of the ruinous scene is enhaneed by the variety of artistic forms employed, and by the tall and slender shape of the largest obelisk in Egypt, rising from the midst of the ruins, and testifying to the past proud splendour of this truly royal edi1l.ce, which has beell ruthlessly trodden under foot by the monotonous cycle of years and shattered by war and earthquakes. -The nearer we approach to the sanctnary the older al'e the parts of the temple we traverse.

The pylons lying to the S. were built by the kings of the 18th Dyn., and were eonnellted with the side of the great temple of Ammon, whence they were reached by a door between Pylon III and Pylon IV (p. 146). On the rear of the left side of Pylon ill is a long inscription (unfortunately imperfect at the top), recording the gifts of hotep ill. to the god Ammon; and to the left is the representation of several ships, recording. a festival voyage instituted by the king in honour of the god in his naos. The sanctuary existed before the Hyksos period, certainly under the 12th Dyn., and the conquerors and expellers of the intruders erected in honour of Ammon cessive additions, increasing in size as they receded from the sanctuary. On passing through the third ruined pylon into the Oentral Oourt (pl. E), we come first upon two OBBLISKS, of which, however, one has been destroyed, though Pococke saw them both erect in 1738. The standing obelisk (pI. g) is, like most others, made of granite from the quarries of Syene (Assubl). It is 76 ft. high and stands upon a base 6 ft. square. Only the lower portions of the inscriptions on its faces are seriously injured. The central rows are in larger and finer hieroglyphics than the side-rows. The former date from the time of Tutmes 1., the latter contain the names of later appropriators of this monument. The usual formulae occur in these inscriptions; Tutmes I., among other titles, is named the victory-bringing Horus, who fuWs the years and enlivens the hearts. He, 'the lovely son of the sun, erected this monument in honour of his father Ammon, lord of the throne of the world, who is shipped in E. Thebes ('Apet')'. In front of this obelisk are the remains of a cubical basis, which probably served to support a colossus. The two obelisks and the colossus marked the entrance to the temple in the reign of Tutmes I. Next follows Pylon IV, in such a ruinous condition that its ginal form cannot be ascertained. It dates from the time of mes I., who is represented by the Osiris-columns attached to its inner tE.) side. Only the N. door-pillar is now standing. It bears an expresssion of homage to Ammon from Tutmes IV.

The queen is uniformly referred to by the feminine pronoun, though she is represented as a man and named 'a son 0.( the sun'. On the rectangular base of the obelisk it is recorded (N. side) that the queen erected it in seven months in the 16th and 17th years of her reign, and (E. side) that it was overlaid with gold, that the queen herself weighed out the necessary gold in sacks and bars, so that (S. side) the people on both banks beheld it glittering at sunrise. -The obelisks are enclosed by'a rectangular granite 
wall, 12-15 ft. in height. As we proceed towards the E., we pass another Pyla" (Pl. V), now completely ruined, and enter a SHOOND COLONNADB, with figures representing Tutmes I. In each of the spaces to the right and left are five pairs of columns. Between them was a central space enclosed by Tutmes, with two of the Osiris-statues embedded in the wall. An inscription informs us that this surrounding wall was raised by Tutmes III. to cover the monuments of his father Tutmes I., 'so that the monuments of llis father Usertessn (12th Dyn.) and the monuments of his fathers, kings of Upper and Lower Egypt, should not be seen in presence of his own'. On the walls of tbis narrow room, and on the right and left of the gateway with granite pillars which forms the opening of Pylon V, are the name-labels of the peoples conquered by Tutmes III. The S. peoples are named on the right: 'List of the S. lands, of the Anu Kenes from Khent-hun·nefer, defeated by His Majesty, he wrought havoc among them, their multitude is not known, he brought all that belonged to them as li ving captives to Thebes, to 1ilI the work-house of Ammon-Ba'. Beneath are 116 name-rings of quered tribes of the S. lands j first those of Kush (Ethiopians j the Cush of SOripture), then those of Punt (Arabians), and lastly the Libu (Libyans).

The.building of every temple, without tion, began with the construction of the sanctuary j and beyond doubt, we are here standing in front of the most ancient part of the entire temple of Ammon. The granite pillars to the right and left, on which a large 'flower-calyx appears between two smaller ones, also date from Tutmes III. Beyond these pillars and a small chamber we reach the space usually regarded as the Sanctuary. It is built entirely of pink granite, and is divided into two chambers, a very uncommon arrangement, although easily explained in the present case (see belOW). The front chamber, opening to the W., is 19 ft. long, the hinder one, opening to the E., over 25 ft. The roof has been completely destroyed; and a slab of granite, leaning obliquely downwards, seems as though on the point of falling. The latter was adorned with stars, and traces of colour are seen both upon it and upon the walls; but the sculptures were never fully completed, and the red outlines which served as a guide to the sculptor may still be made out here and there. The holes in which the hinges were lI.xed, still show traces of verdigris, a proof that the hinges were made of copper or bronze. The entire double-chamber and the pillars at its entrance date rom the reign of Tutmes III. Mariette believed, probably with justice, that the actual sanctuary, or at least the original sanctuary of the 12th Dyn., lay behind (i.e. to the E. of) the granite chamber, because that would alone explain the opening at the back of the chamber. A stele preserved in the museum at Gtzeh records that the temple of Karnak was in existence as early as the close of the 11th Dyn., though then of little importance. Wilkinson found the name of Amenemha 1. (12th Dyn.) on a shattered pedestal to th.e S. of the sanctuary; and an inscription of the 21st Dyn., discovered by E. de Roug6in the southmost court of the temple (in theS.E. angle, to the right of the entrance by the pillars) contains an announcement by a certain Amenhotep, chief priest under Ramses IX., that the sanctuary of the temple of Ammon was built in the time of tesen I. and then restored by himself. Two steles in the quarries of near Cairo (Vol. I., p. 406) record that King Aahmes, the conqueror of the Hyksos, caused stones to be quarried for the temple of Ammon, in the 21st and 22nd year of his reign. At all events the ancient sanctuary stood near the site of the one now fore us, if not actually on the same spot. Tutroes entirely rebuilt it, provi,Ung it with two doors, a peculiarity commented upon above. The W. entrance must have existed before his time, for it was turned towards the portions of the temple built by his ancestors. When Tutmes, however, added the large new ture farther to the E.

On the other hand, nothing is more likely than that one of the later Persian kings selected this temple for destruction after some abortive surrection on the part of the Egyptians, in order to punish the bellious province in its most sensitive part. Ptolemy Soter, who held the reins for Philip Aridreus, could have found no easier way to win the hearts of his new subjects than to restore the holy places destroyed by the Persians j while to do so was to imitate ander the Great. In this particular case the work was not difficult, for though new sculptures had to be provided for the adytum, its walls were for the most part still standing. In the inscription in the interior of the sanctuary, Philip records merely that he had restored with granite the sanctuary which was f&lling to ruin, 'which was built in the time of Tutmes III., king of Upper and Lower Egypt'; and a fragment of the older structure, bearing on its upper side a representation of Tutmes oft'ering gifts to Ammon Generator, was used as a ceiling-slab in the restoration. The inscriptions and carvings on the Inner Walla of the ftrst chamber are neither imposing nor specially interesting. They still exhibit traces of colour, especially of the blue pigment, which was lavishly used to make the ftgures stand out more distinctly from the reddish stone. Ammon in both his main characters (Ammon Generator and Ammon king of the gods) receives the homage of Philip, or rather of the representative of the royal house of Macedon, for it is certain that Philip never entered the valley ofthe Nile. Muth of course also appears with Ammon, and once is depicted as embracing him, an absolutely unique representation.

Various nomes of Upper and Lower Egypt took place in this ceremony. Mention should be made of a large flabellum or feather-screen, which appears to conceal the ligure of Ammon, i.e. the hidden, the veiled. This symbolically indicates that the deeper conception of the essence of the god must remain hidden from the uninitiated. Around the sanctuary lay a number of apartments (now all more or less destroyed) in which later kings, such as Seti II., Sheshenk, and the Ethiopians Sabako and Taharka, have inscribed their names. The last placed their inscriptions upon walls which had been built much earlier, at the latest under Tutmes III.

Farther on, in the axis of the sanctuary, are two square granite bases, one behind the other, being the relics of sixteen-sided columns, with the name of Usertesen I. A little farther to the E. is the doorway of the -Great Colonnade of Tntmelm.(PI. H). The reports of the tary success of this prince, which wehavejustperused, telling us of the enormous wealth at his disposal, and still more the reverence which we see him paying to Ammon at every turn, prepare us to find in this temple some important building reared by him to his divine patron. The space to the W. of the ancient sanctuary had already been occupied by the edifices of his ancestors, so that, as his new building was also to maintain connection with the holy place, he was forced to build on the site to the E. We have already seen how, contrary to the usual custom, he provided the sacred chamber with a second doorway (opening to the E.). The form and appearance of the courts and chambers that lay between the tuary and the colonnade cannot now be determined, for they have been utterly destroyed. The ancient holy place built by the kings of the 12th Dyn. was probably surrounded by two concentric walls, separated by an archway or passage. The colonnaded hall, which we enter by the central door, is 144 ft. wide and 52ft. deep. The roof was supported by 20 columns in two rows i while 82 square lars (14 at the sides, 4 at the ends) formed four galleries with the walls of the hall. The pillars, though notso tall as the columns, were of the same height as the walls, and with the latter supported the roofing slabs. As the middle of the hall was also roofed, a small wall, with sloping exterior and decorated with the astragal and cave cornice, rose from the roof above the pillars and walls to the height of the columns in the centre. There was thus formed a kind of clerestory, which was provided wtthreetangularwindows, broader than they 
were high, in order to admit light to the hall. The 
central columns belong to a peculiar order, the various parts of which on the shaft and capital were indicated only by painting. They have received the name of 'iA"Mted calyx-capita18', because the bells or calyces were placed inverted on the smooth shafts, which were painted a dark red and adorned with vertical inscriptions, recalling the similar decoration of the central panels of the tlnted polygonal columns. As the edge of the tlower-calyx rested upon the end of the shaft, the latter expanded at the top, with some abruptness i and the annuli had in consequence to be placed somewhat low down on the cylindrical shaft (below the beginning of the expansion), to save them from the appearance of slipping down. The capitals are adorned with calyx-or marsh-plants, the tips of which, of course, point downwards. In place of the fmit-germ, these inverted lyces support somewhat lofty abaci, on which rests an architrave adorned with Ane hieroglyphics.

The method of uniting capital and shaft gives evidence of genuine artistic feeliug j bnt the general effect of this style of column was nnattractive, and after its employment here it fonnd no admirers and was given up. -This hall contains no inscriptions of general interest. The hieroglyphic characters on the architrave are carved in the large and handsome style of the 18th Dyn., but they merely announce in the usual formal way that Tutmes III. built the hall of tine limestone and sandstone in honour of his father Ammon. The S. part of the rear-wall of this hall in adjoined by a chamber in which seven well-made polygonal columns are still standing. Two small doorways lead from the centre of the naded hall into a SANCTUARY (PI. I), on the front of which the name Alexander may be read. This, however, does not refer to the great conqueror of Darius, but to his and 
Roxana's son, Alexander II., a royal puppet for whom Ptolemy I. Soter ruled. Another tion informs us that Tutmes built this @anctuary also. The latter was probably used for cults, while, as we have seen, the granite room of Philip Aridrells (p. 134) must be regarded as the holy of holies proper, even for this temple. The colours on the walls of tbis room are in good preservation. In spite of the ruins and rubbish lying about here the traveller should not omft to glance into the chambers of the rear colonnaded hall. One of them tains an interesting representation. The god Seth (Vol. I., p.132; here half defaced) of Nub (K6m Ombo) teaches Tutmes II. to shoot with the bow, while Horus instructs him in the use of the lance. The hostile twin-brothers bestow upon the Pharaoh strength to win victory, which Is symbolized by tho vulture ofvtctoryhovering above the group. The Oolumna which are still standing in the hinder portions of the temple are of interest as specimens of the favourite orders under the 18th Dynasty. Near the centre four beautifully sculptured pyrus-bud columns stand in a row from E. to W., and a few paces to the N.W. are two polygonal columns united by an architrave. In Room Y, excavated by Mariette, are some interesting representations of animals and plants, which. as the accompanying inscriptions inform 118, were transplanted from Retennu (Assyria) to Egnt by Tutmes III., in the 25th year of his reign. We now turn to the S., to the Side-Building of the temple of mes III. (pl. K), where there are 9 chambers adjoiuing each other, each opening to the N.

(the Antef) and of the 12th, 13th, and 17th (conquerors of the Hykso&) Dyn., who all probably resided at Thebes. The names, however, are not in chronological order. Omitting for the present the lake (p. 144) to the S. of this row of chambers, we return to the middle of the building and quit it by the girdle-wall on the E. Immediately behind the wall Ramses II built a HaU (PI. L), adorned with caryatides, now completely ruined. About 45 paces farther E., and connected with this hall, is a small Temple (pl. M), built by the same Pharaoh, but so ruined as to present little of interest. Caryatides were employed here also j and two papyrus-bud columns may be mentioued, on which the place of the IIsual cubical abaci is occupied by tolerably high fragments of earlier polygonal shafts, utilized in the same manner as the Arabs used the fragments of Greek and Roman temples. Beyond these ruins, and still farther to the E., is the well-preserved Pylon VI. (62 ft. high), which must be regarded as the main entrance to the great temple of Ammon for those approaching from the E. Outside it traees of the girdle-wall of the temple, built of bricks of Nile clay, may still be found. This eastmost pylon has few sculptures, but the inscriptions indicate that it was erected by Nekht-nebf, i.e. Nectanebus II., who had not time to finish its decoration. This prince, who ascended the throne of the Pharaohs during the Persian era and waged successful wars, especially in Upper Egypt against the satraps ofthe Asiatic invaders, found both courage and means, hard pressed and threatened as he was, to erect important buildings not only here but also on the island of Philae and elsewhere. Thus the pylon which limited the temple of Ammon to the E. may be regarded as a tangible ptoof of the obstinate independence ofthe Egyptians. -This pylon is 510 yds. distant from the first CW.) pylon.

sible lines of hieroglY'!lhics. About 40 ft. to the right (E.) of the door through which we quitted the hypostyle, a short wall projects at right angles from the wall of the great temple, bearing a most interesting and important inscription, containing the Treaty of Peace destined to put an end to the wars between the Egyptians and the Asiatics. This is the most ancient international treaty e:dantin the world, and It is as remarkable for ita contents as for its form, which is so conceived in the essential points that modern documents of a similar aim differ from it only in the greater conciseness of their expressions. The bottom of the inscription is at present concealed by rubbish. The treaty is dated the 21st Tybi in the 21st year of King Ramses II. Miamnn, in the town of Tanis, Ł.ŁŁ the Ramsestown. The Kheta prince caused the treaty to be engraved on a silver table and sent nn ambassador to seek peace. The document proper, divided into paragraphs and translated by the eminent French Egyptologist F. Chabas, begins as follows: 'Formerly and for a long period the mighty king of Egypt and the prince of the Kheta lived in good understanding (God grant that hostility never again exist between them). Nevertheless he declared war against the great king (Seti I.) of Egypt, in the time of M autnur, my brother, prince of the Kheta. But from to-day and from this day Khetasar, prince of the Kheta, makes a treaty in order to arrive at a lasting understanding. May Ra, may Seth lend them endurance, as well for Egypt as for the land of the Kheta (Aram,.,a), so that hostility may never again arise between them. -The fullowing points were agreed upon: Khetasar, prince of the Kheta, unites with Ramses the mighty king of Egypt, to cause to exist between t11em good peace anll good alliance from this day onwards forever. He shall be allied with me, he shall be at peace with me; and I, I shall be allied with him, and I, I shall be at peace with him forever'. After a brief historical retrospect!. the treaty goes on: 'The prince of the Kheta will never again invade l!'gypt to carry off anything whatever out of it, and Ramses lIiamun, the mighty king of Egypt, will never invade the land of the Kheta, to carry off anything whatever out of it'. Then, after another historical retrospect: 'When enemies turn against the land of Ramses the mighty king of Egypt, he will send to the prince of the .Ebeta the message, 'Come and unite thyself with my might against them'. The prince of the Kheta will be at the disposal of the king of Egypt and will smite his enemies. If the prince of the Kheta does n.ot take the field in person, he will send his foot-soldiers and war chariots to amite the enemies of the king of E_gypt .ŁŁŁ and vice vers" (with repetition of the above paragraph). -. Then follows a remarkable convention by which the parties to the treaty bind themselves not to use force in preventing skilled workmen from passing from one country into the other. The gods and goddesses, the Baalim of the land of the Kheta (translated 'Seth') Astarte, and a 'thousand' local deities mountains, and rivera are invoked M witnesses by the Asiatics, while the Egyptians invoke Ammon Ra, Seth, the warlike gods and goddesses, the mountains and rivers of Egypt, the shore of the Mediterranean, the wind, and the e\ouds. These power. are to punish the breaker of the treaty; while to him who keeps it they shall grant life, to him and to his house, his estate, and his servants. Next follow two remarkable articles in which the contracting parties bind themselves mutually to extradite criminals; though, by a condition which speaks highly for the civilization reached by both nations, his crime 'shall not be permitted to raise itself' against the extradited criminal, i .Ł. the criminal process against him shall be suspended, and no harm shall be done to hi. hou.eJ or to hi. wife, or to hi. children; he .hall also not be punishell in the eye, mouth, no

A visit to the ruins to the N. of the temple of Ammon need not detain the traveller for any long time, unless his object be to decipher ths inscriptions and to gather from them philological or historical information.

The IravelIer who haa little time at his disposal, or who must proceed with the steamer, may content himself wilh a glance at the great N. girdle-wall of Nile-bricks, and at the gate of the Ptolemies. Beginning at the E. Pylon of Nectanebus (p. 141), we skirt the girdle-wall of the great temple of Ammon, first to the N. and then to the W. Veft), until we see upon the right or N. side of our path another girdle-wall of Nile-bricks. Within this lies a ruined Temple (PI. N), the axis of which lies S.W. andN.E. Like theN. pylon (see below) it was dedicated to Mentu, the god of war, and is frequently mentioned on demotic tiles (ostraca). Stretching N.E. from this building is an avenue of sphinxes, which we reach on passing through the door of a well-preserved pylon. Little now remains of the temple, which dates from the time of Amenhotep Ill. of the 18th Dyn. (who also erected two obelisks, as appears from a mentary inscription found here), though it was subsequently several times enlarged between the reign of Ramses IV. and the epoch of the Ptolemies, especially by Ptolemy IV. Philopator. Ptolemy II. Philadelphus and Ptolemy III. Euergetes have recorded their names here, and there is also a stone bearing the name of 'Ramses'. The earlier sculptures and architectural fragments are of great beauty; and columns with Hathor capitals were also employed. The mentioned Pylon (Pl. VII), the most N. part of the editlce now remaining, was founded by Ptolemy II. At its foot is a list of nomes, and higher up are numerous other inscriptions. The fellil1).in boys are shy of accompanying travellers to this spot towards evening, as it is said to be haunted by an 'Afrit or devil. It is called by the natives Bdb el-'Abtd, or gate of the negro-slaTeS, probably on account of some of the representations on its walls. From the pylon we proceed to the S.

On the other side of the girdle-wall, i.e. over the hill, is another Building (pl. P), erected by Tutmes III., but where also are found the names of King Horus, Sabako, Taharka, and several of the lemies, including Philometor and Neos Dionysus. This temple was dedicated to Ptah and HathM', whose priests are represented. In a chamber, which may be described as the p,.onaos, are traces of the staircase leading to the roof, now fallen in. Here also are two gonal columns, which, taken in connection with dedicatory tion, indicate that the erection of the temple was begun under the 18th Dynasty. As we again approach the N. wall of the hypostyle of the great temple and the door by which we issued to view the battle-reliefs of Seti I. (p. 127), we pass, a little to the N. of the latter, two small ruined temples (PI. Q) of the 26th Dynasty. The princes of this illustrious line were less able to rear elaborate ings at Thebes in proportion as they devoted the means at their disposal to building magnificent temples in honour of the gods of Memphis and still more of Sais, their residences in Lower Egypt. These little temples, now surrounded by the ruined huts of a serted Arab village, were, according to the inscriptions, built by Queen Ankhnes, who here appears with Psammetikh III. (perhaps her son 1) and with her husband Aahmes. Ankhnes was the 'daughter of Psammetikh II. To the right of the entrance and in the doorway to the left of the smaller temple is the queen accompanied by her young chamberlain Sheshonk, ascion of the Bubastites of the 2'2nd Dyn., in whose veins ftowed royal blood. Nitocris, wife of tikh II., also appears in the second doorway of the interior. Her magnificent sarcophagus is now in the museum at Gtzeh, while that of Queen Ankhnes is in the British Museum. m.

The Arabs name this Birket or Lake of the Salt-pit, as the water has become saline and undrinkable through infiltration. It is known that each temple formerly possessed a Sacred Lake, and there is no doubt that in antiquity the golden boat of the god used to ftoat upon the water of 
thls pond, kept pnre and fresh. The banks were ciently laced with hewn stones, and traces of these are still to be seen on the W., S., and especially on the N. or nealest side, though at most points they were covered by rubbish in the course of ages.

Boutt. 145 granite sanctoary (p. 184) are a few half-ruined chambers forming a kind of annexe to the B. wall of the temple, and partly constructed of alabaster, a sUbstance rarely used for building. The mins nearest the lake date from the reign of Tutmes III., those diately adjoining the temple-wall from the reign of the Ethiopian Taharka. A square apartment, decorated with paintings of which the colours are still vivid, displays some curious deities, probably Ethiopian, but only the upper parts ofthe paintings are now visible. We now return to the doorway opening to the B., between the third and fourth pylons (p. 182), upon which is the cartouche of Ramses IX. 0l U Ba nefer ka. To the B.W. of this point, in an irregular line and at varying distances from each other, are Pylons VIII, IX, X, and XI. From. the last of th'ese an avenue of sphinxes (now concealed by a small wood) stretches to the temple of Muth. Pylon XI is turned towards this avenue, but the pylons X, IX, and VIII, succeeding each other towards'the N., gradually effect the transition to the great temple of Ammon by their position and the angle they stand at with reference to the B. wall of the great temple j for, as will be seen from the Plan, none of them is exactly parallel with that wall. The four pylons are connected with each other by side-walls running at irregular angles, and thus enclosing four courts, which, however, are no longer clearly defined owing to gaps in the walls. Through these four gateways passed the ancient cessionalroute, which began at the temple ofMuth, in which were the statues of Bekhet (p. 148), and ended at the temple of Ammon in the space with the two obelisks (p. 132), which may be regarded as the vestibule of the sanctuary. The series of four COUf'ts between the pylons, which we now visit, had an aggregate length of 310 yds. (not reckoning the avenue). It was begun in the early times of the 18th Dyn. mes I.), and was afterwards several times enlarged and adorned. Beginning at the gateway of Ramses IX. (see above), we have on our right the fragment of wall (probably dating from Beti 1.) on the W. side of which is the famous treaty (p. 142), and on the left the wall running to meet Pylon VIII, and probably dating like that pylon from Tutmes III. On the front of this latter wall king Merenptah, son of Ramses II., caused an inscription of great est to be carved. From this we learn that the king victoriously opposed the Libyans and their allies, the Islanders of the Mediterranean, whose later expedltlons against Egypt are recorded in the inscriptions at lIedinet Habu (p. 177). Under his father the Egyptians had advanced into Asia I now, the peoples to the W. and N. of the Nile valley, the Libyans and lIaxyans, and with them Lyclans, 8ardinians, 8lcilians, Aehll!.ns, and a tribe named Puleda (more probablr, Philistines than Pelasgians) dare to invade the Della and to dwell there like previous kings' (i.t. probably the Hyksos).

From the shattered inscriptions we learn that King Horns founded this pylon, though Ramses II. afterwards unjustly placed his own name upon it and upon two granite statues no longer extant. The names of Ramses IV. (I.£ak ma) and above it Ramses VI. (Nefer \lak an) are also found, on the horizontal band on the N. side of the pylon.

The wings of this huge edifice, constructed of hewn sandstone, have collapsed, but the central way of granite is still standing. Four blocks of granite, on the right of the doorway and facing the court, are decorated with a Relief, representing with remarkable vivacity King Horus approaching the god with two libation-vessels. An inscription within the granite portal informs us that this king, who ruled at the close of the 18th Dyn., built the pylon, using for that purpose some hewn stones bearing the name of Amenhotep IV. (Khu-en-aten) the strange sun-worshipper whom we met at Tell el-Amarnah (p. 23). From this it has been concluded that a building erected at Karnak by the schismatic was destroyed soon after his death. In front of the N. side of the pylon are two headless limestone colossi. Ramses II. placed his name upon these as well as upon the pylon; and some priests of Ammon of the 21st Dyn. have also commemorated selves upon the latter. -On the W.

.. 148 Route 11. KARNAK. East Bank square pillars are used in place of the more usual columns. These simple artistic forms themselves suggest an early origin for the edifice, and the inscriptions record that it was built by Amenhotep n. and III. A gallery is adjoined by a hall with 20 pillars, and that again by several arranged in a elsewhere found. On several of the pillars, whose unadorned capitals are striking, the king appears before Ammon. It is not easy to mine the purpose of this building. It cannot have been a palace. Perhaps it contained stables for the sacred animals of the dift'erent deities, or was the depository for the sacri1leial gifts presented within the 1lrst pylon. Perhaps Ammon's guard of honour, whil'h is quently mentioned and which had to watch over the temple, was quartered here; or it may have been used by the priests on duty for the day as a temporary resort. Various reasons prevent us from regarding it as the actnal abode either of the kings or of the dants on the gods. -To the S. of Pylon XI is the base of a Statue of King Horus, the lower part of which dates from Amenhotep III. Beyond the pylon, which we skirt rather than pass through, is the Avenue of Sphinxes, bounding the processional route that led to the S. buildings. To the E. of the avenue two Chamber" painted in bright colours, were excavated by Mariette. They belong to a temple of Osiris-Ptah, who is here represented as worshipped by Taharka and by Amontanut, apparently a contemporary king (the Urdamani of Assyrian inscriptions). The avenue leads to the temple of Muth (see below), whiie it is connected by a branch with the sphinx-avenue leading from the temple of Khunsu to Luxor (comp. p. 116). In a straight direction the 1lrst-mentioned avenue is terminated by a Gate (PI. r), built by the Ptolemies, in the N. side of a girdle-wall enclosing a horae-shoe shaped lake. In front of this lake stood the Temple of .uth (Pl. T), built by Amenhotep III., and now so completely ruined that it is difficult to determine its original arrangement. To the right and left of the gate of Ptolemy Philadelphus (which bears a beautiful bymn to the goddess Muth), and both witbout and within the wall, were numerous lion-beaded Figure, of 8ekhet, many of which have already found their way to European museums (e.g. at Turin). A second gate bears tbe cartoucbes of Seti n. and Set-nekht. In a small Apartment on the E. side of the temple is a record of a ration of the temple by Mentuembat, priest of Ammon, in the time of Tabarka.

KARNAK. 11. Boute. 149 of Eh1lJ1lu (Pl. V), the portal of which we have already seen on our way from Luxor to the river-front of the great temple of Ammon. An avenue of sphinxes, approximately parallel with the tioned avenue between Pylon XI and the temple of Muth, leads to the slender Ptolemaic Pylon XII and beyond it to the temple of Khunsu proper, which lies a little farther N. The temple is fully proportioned, in many places adorned with remarkable care, and in various respects of great interest. It was erected by ses Ill. in honour of Xhu""" i.e. the god who represents, so to speak, the youthful Ammon in the triad of Thebes. Elsewhere, it may here be noted, Khunsu is conceived of almost as the moon-god (with the child's lock of hair on his temple and the crescent-moon on his head), and thus identified with Thoth-Hermes. Just as Ammon is called the soul of Ra, so Khunsu is to be regarded as the spiritual quintessence of the earlier moon-god, and may be named, like Thoth, 'the representative of the spirit, the "atio i"tema of all things'. As Pa a'l' Bekke" or 'plan-maker' he guides the deliberations of mortals, and he becomes also the divine physician (Khun", neff" hotep, 'the good helper'), who considerately restores the sick to health. Oynocephali, sacred to Khunsu as well as to Thoth, were kept here. -In the great HUf'f'iB Papyrus Ramses III. says of this temple: 'I built a honse in Thebes for thy son Khunsu, of good hewn stone, of sandstone, black stone, its doors covered with gold, adorned with electrum like the celestial horizon'. In the same document it is named Pa (house) BamseB an in Pa Khun", with 264 persons; and afterwards: 'Persons whom he (RamsesllI.) gave to Pa Xhun", in Vas Neferhotep, HOf' lord of the wide hea'l't, 249'. There thus appear to have been two dill'erent temples erected to Khunsu. The inscriptions inform us that he had not time to finish the 'House of Khunsu', but was obliged to leave later rulers to complete the Periatyle Court and the Pylon. The last was erected by the king Pinozem, son of Piankhi, of the 21st Dyn.; but Alexander II. is also commemorated in the doorway to the peristyle court. This court itself has on three sides a double row of papyrus-bud columns, six in each row. From the inscriptions we gather that after tions of this building were built by various Ramses olthe 20th Dyn., the priest-king Herhor, predecessor and perhaps grandfather zem, contributed to its decoration. Most of what we know of the kings of the 21st Dyn. is derived from the inscriptions here. The clooe connection which must at that time have existed between Asia and the Nile valley is proved by a Stelt found in the temple of Xhunsu and now preserved in the Bibliothilque Nationale at Paris. -Upon this one of the last kings of the 20th Dyn. records lhat he married the daughter of a tributary prince, made her his queen, and in order to cure her younger sister who was possessed by devils (i.e. insane) sent first a physician and then a statue ofXhunsu to Bekhten. After the healing god had done what was expected of him, the father-in-law of the Pharoah detained the Btalue until he was warned in .. dream to send it back 10 Egypt in ita aacred boal.

The calyx-capitals are comparatively low, and their edges are bent out to a remarkable extent. Beyond this hall are tbe rooms of the Sanctuary.

It is worth noting that the temple of Khunsu contains the only representation of circumcision yet covered in Egypt.

To the right and left of this wide hall are two rooms, and behind are three others, the middle one of which gives access to the Sanctuary. The inscriptions on the walls owe their origin to the Ptolemies j the earliest, &S the also informs us, to Ptolemy IX. Euergetes II., and to Cleopatra, his sister and wife. The pregnant hippopotamus-goddess Apet was the goddess of births. Her ftnely executed statue of serpentine, found in the ruins of the ancient city, is now in the museum at Gizeh. It dates from the 26th nasty. The inscriptions and'l"epresentations refer largely to Osiris, whose birth was commemorated here, and to the gods associated with him. On the outside of the temple-wall and on the walls joining it are found the names of Ptolemy Auletes and the emperor Augustus. A list of nomes, also found here, is unfortunately much damaged. EXCORSION TO lISDAlICT, only to be undertaken when there is dance of time; 4-5 hrs. are necess.ry. The site is reached after 1'/. hr.'s rapid riding. We proceed: 1Irst to the E. sphinx-avenue of Karnak, where the road diverges to the right, along a large embankment. It then turns to the left and runs mostly along tile edge of ditches, frequented, especially in December, by wild fowl. 'Ihe Temple' of Xedamiit, at one time a large and beautiful edi1lce, is now so completely ruined that even its ground-plan eannot be traced. The village, a kind of suburb of Thebes, was called TIman and lay to the N. of the temple. Month of Thebes was the god chieHy worshipped here, but Bulo (uazi) and Apet were also revered. 'l'he erection of this temple dales from lhe lime of Amenhotep II., of the 18th Dynasty. His name occurs on the large granite 'pillars which are still standing and which probably formed part of the Sanctuarl/. Numerous blocks of granite lie scattered around. The sancluary was adjoined by a large edifice, lying mately from E. to W. lIuch farther to the W. was a PlIlon, facing the river, but now destroyed, leaving nothing but a heap of blocks of stone. Various fragmentary inscriptions in a good style inform us that it was built by Seti I. and Ramses II. Under the Ptolemies an addition was made to the earlier temple, including the Colonnade which is noW the most conspicuous and most interesting feature of the ruins. Five columns are still standing. Four of these, on which still rests the stone architrave, appear to have bounded a now destroyed peristyle court and to have formed the first row of columns in a hypostyle hall, which cannot have exisled before the time of the Ptolemies. The other column is the only telic of the second row. Both this Imd the two bnd-columns (to the left) in the 1Irst row appear to belong to the 18th Dyn.; the IWO latter certainly did, for their sculptured shafta and capitals clearly indicate that the artistic Idea which dictated their form still retained a vigorous freshness al Ihe time of their erection. On the other hand the late borate plastic decoration of the calyx-capitals of the other two columns more to the right, the curious clOSing of the intercolumniations by means of barrier-like walls, half as high as the shafts, and crowned with a concave cornice, and the treatment of the doors, whose absent covering was merely indicated on both sides by erections with concave cornices, would in selves be proofs that Ihe building was not erected before the epoch of the Plolemies, even if the inacriptions did not contain the same information.

THEBES. Wed Bank: and Auletea. AntoniDus Pius bestowed some attention on the c1ecoration of this e4idce, the picturesque remains of which show that even in the age of the Ptolemies the practice of using ancient columns for new buildings was well understood, a practice which became very common under the Arabs. The use of other ancient fragments of buildings (especially heWD blocks of stone) was 
frequent even in very early times. As we return, we may once more walk through the temple of Xarnak, a digression which will not add more than 1/. hr. to the day's expedition. If the traveller have made an early start, he may lunch in the hypostyle hall of Xarnak, under the shadow of the largest columns in the world where the destroyers of the temple and previous travellers have provided seats in the shape of blocks of stone. B. THE WEST BANK AT THEBES. Passengers by the three-weeks' tourist-steamers devote the ist and Brd (Cook) or 2nd and Brd (Gaoe) day of thair stay at Thebes to the We.t Bank; those by the four-weak's steamers the 2nd and 4th (Cook) or 8rd and 4th (Gaoe) day; arranging in each case to spend the drst day in a visil to the sepulchral temple of 8eti I. and the Tombs of the Xings (RR. 19, 20), and the second In visiting the Ramesseum, 8Mkh 'Abd e1-Xurnah, el-Medinah and Medlnet Habu (RR. 13-18). A dilferent arrangement is recommended on 102, for a three day's stay at Thebes, according to which the drst day s visit to the W. bank is devoted to the Colossi of IIemnon, IIedinet Habu, el-Medlneh, SMkh 'Abd e1-Xurnah (RR. 12-18), and the next day to the sepulchral temple of 8eti I: and the Tombs of the Xings lRR. 20). If dve days are spent at Thebes, three should be devoted to the w. bank, the drst being occupied by the Colossi of IIemnon, the temple of IIedinet Habu, and Dcr el-IIedineh (RR. 12, 15, 17), the second by the Ramesseum, the tombs of 'Abdel-Xurnah, the temple of Der el-ba\lri, etc. (RR. IS, 18, 21), and the third 'by the Temple of Seli I. and the Tombs of the Kings (RR. 19, 20), with which Cook's and Oaze's tourists begin. The ensuing description follows the distribution of time suggested on p. 10".1 for a three day's visit to Thebes. The following points may be visited in a IInV" day (the 2nd of our stay in Thebes), though not without considerable fatigue: 1. "Colossi of lIemnon; 2. "Ramesseum; S. Tombs of Xurnet lIurra'; 4. "IIedinet Habu; 5. Tombs of the Queens and Der el-IIedineh; 6. Tombs of SMkh 'Ab4 el-Xurnab. A little time may be saved by beginning at the Ramesseum, and thence proceeding to the Colossi of lIemnon, lIedinet Habu, elc.; but it is better to visit the Colossi Orst, for they are at nO time so lmpr88sive as when seen in the early morning. An ,/Jrlg start should be made. Guidu, donk'II', etc., see p. 103. If the dbababiyeh has been anch\lred at Luxor and not beside the W. bank (p. 101), it will be necessary to cross in a boat to the Island opposite Luxor. Donkeys are usually found here, but a largeperty is recommended to order them the night before. The island, which IS dolled with bushes and at places well-cultivated, is crossed in about 10 miD., and the keys then ford a shallow arm of the river. If the river is high, however, travellers must row round 
the island. We pus the village, pleasanlly shaded by tre88, and cross a very frail bridge over a water-course ing to the Nile.

Colo88i of Memnon. THEBES. 12. Route. 153 tains. On the Weat Bank lay the ŁŁ oropolil or City of the Dead, connected with which were a large number oftemple5. These latter are called Memnonia, because they were dedicated to the memory of the lives and deeds of the great Pharaohs, and because they were regarded as the abodes of the' dead monarchs, and sacri:6.ces were offered within them to the royal manes and to the gods, to whom the kings owed their might. Built on the verge of the necropolis, they stood in close relation to the worship of the dead. Just as scienti:6.c institutions etc. were maintained in connection with the Serapea adjoining the cemeteries of Memphis and Alexandria, so the temples here were adjoined by various other establishments. These included libraries, schools, dwellings for the priests, medical colleges, embalming-houses, stables and pastures for the sacred animals, and lodgings for pilgrims, while near the sacred ponds and groves were entire streets, containing not only barracks for the temple-guards and dwellings for the ecclesiastical and lay.of:6.cials, but also shops and houses of private citizens who carried on trade in the various articles used at burials or brought as offerings to the deceased. The guild of Kolchytes or embalmers is frequently tioned (especially at a late date) as a numerous and by no means harmonious society. Public works of various kinds are mentioned in the demotic and Greek commercial contracts which have been found here and are dated from this place. Among these a canal, a sacred lake, a large street, etc. are named. 'l;'here were many other temples besides those whose ruins are now traceable, and round each were grouped houses of .various kinds, so that Strabo and other Greek writers were justi:6.ed in describing Thebes as sporadically inhabited. The last-named reliable geographer writes: 'Thebes is now sporadically inhabited. Part of it Ues in Arabia (E. bank of the Nile), including the city proper, and part on the opposite bank, where the Memnonium is situated'. Strabo, like all his men, was especially by the so-called OOl08,i of Memnon, which he considered as repaying in themselves the trouble of the journey to Thebes. 12. The Colossi of lIemnon.

The sions of the former, in which the original form is more easily seen, are as follows: height Clf the figure, 62. ft., height of the pedestal on which the feet rest, 13 ft., height of the entire monument, 64 ft. But when the figure was adorned with the long-since vanished crown, the original height may have reached 69 ft. The legs from the sole to the knee measure 191/2 ft., and each foot is 101/. it. long. The breadth of the shoulders is 193/, ft.; the middle finger 011 one hand is 41/2 ft. long; and the arm from the tip of the finger to the elbow measures 15th ft. The entire colossus, ing the throne and pedestal, weighs 1175 tons. Both statues face E.S.E. and stand parallel to the COurse of the Nile, though they are no longer as one inclines a little towards the olher· and both are canted slightly nackwards. The S. colossus is a little in front of the N. one, from which it is 22 paces dislant. Both are seamed with cracks, and such large fragments have fallen from Ihem, that one could imagine that an attempt has been made to destroy them by lire. The Arabs call the N. colossus Tama, the S. one 8hama, and both gether Salamdt, or 'the greetings'. t When the Nile is at its highest, its waters reach the soles of the feet of the colossi and sometimes the upper surface of the pedestal on which they rest. As this pedestal I. 1S ft. high and as Ihe slatues musl have been beyond the reach of inundations In the time of Ihe Pharaohs, Lepaiu8 is correct in assuming from hi. observations of Ihe nilometer al Semneb (p. 342) Ihal Ihe bed of Ihe Nile allhal point must have been considerably raised within historical times. He estimates the total rise at 21i ft. In winter, however, the traveller reaches the statues dry-shod. These colossi were not always solitary monuments, remote from all other buildings. On the contrary they originally stood on either side of a gigantic Pylon, whieb rose behind them and formed the entrance to a M ...... onium, of which tensive relics still remain, though for the most part covered with earth. This temple, now completely annihilated, was founded by Amenhotep m., who is represented by the colo.si. Neither this monarch nor his statues have any connection whatever wilh the Greek JIIemnon, who was the son of Eoa (Ihe dawn) and Tlthonus, became one of the allies of Priam, and slew Antilochus, the brave Bon of Nestor, for which he was himself slain by Achilles. Homer mentions this Memnon twice in the Odyssey: 'For he Ihought in his mind of the likeness of the noble Antilochus' 'Whom the lordly '0" of the brightming d_ slew'. And of Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles, it is said: , 'No one handsomer than he have I seen, next til the godlike M..,.,..,,'. This Memnlln was an Asiatic hero, who is said also to have huilt the forlresses of SUBa and Echatana. When the Greeks became acquainted with the Nile valley and its monuments, they imagined that they had found sumptuous buildings of the Homeric hero in Ihe commemorative ments named 'mennu' by the Egyptians (p. !iii). The colossi before us were also called 'mennu' by the inhabitants of Thehes, and loon came to be described by Ihe Hellenes as statues of Memnon, though the Egyptians even to a late period knew that they represented Amenhotep Ill., a king of the 18th Dynasty.

THEBES. and soldiers, heard the sound about the llrst hour; but I was unable to decide whether it proceeded from the base or from the statue, or indeed whether it was deliberately produced by one of thole ing round the pedestal. For as I do not know the cause, anything appears to me much more c.redible than that the sound issued from the stone thus placed'. Doubts as to the genuineness of the nomenon ceased soon after Strabo's time, and while that famoul geographer mentions only an inarticulate Pausanias speaks of a musical note and Juvenal refers to the 'resonance from the magic strings of the shattered Hemnon'. By later observers the sound is compared to that of a stroke upon metal, or even of a pet-blast and of human voices singing. The sound was heard only at or soon after sunrise, though by no means invariably then i and some of the most distinguished visitors were disappointed of hearing it. Among these was Septimius Severus, who caused the restoration of the upper portions, perhaps with a view to propitiate the angry god. Thereafter the phenomenon ceased, and the colossus, abhorred by the Christians as a pagan idol, fell rapidly into oblivion as the new religion spread. Letronne has .proved that the resonance of the stone is on no aeeount to be explained as a mere priestly trick, and in the opinion of eminent physicists, it is perfectly possible that a hard resonant stone, healed by the warm sunlight suddenly following upon the cold nights in Egypt, might emit a sound in the early morning. A similar phenomenon has been observed elsewhere, as by Professor Ebers under the porphyry clill's of the 8inal mountains, and by the savants of the French dition near the granite-sanctuary at Karnak and in the granite quarries of Assuau (8yene). An English traveller near the Maladelta in the nees heard a sound issuing from the rocks, not unlike the nole ot an Aeolian harp, and the name given to II by the natives, 'the matins of the damned'.!.. seems to prove that it was of frequent if not regular rence. 'l'ne 'music-stones' of the Orinoco are well-known. In the Gova valley, to the S. of Lake Nyassa Livingstone observed the thunderous sound of splitting stones, ascrib;.! by the natives to the agency of Kohesi or evil spirits. And the German consul, Dr. Wetzstein, reports similar phenomena in the volcanic region discovered by him to the E. of mascus. Possibly the extensive broken and sloping surface of the sus, wet with the dews of early morning, was exposed unusually direcLly to the rays of the rising sun, and the famous sound may have been duced by a current of air, generated by this sudden change of temperature, passing over the rough and pebbly surface. In that ease the phenomenon would naturally cease when the upper part of the figure was replaced. The numerous Greek and Latin inscriptions, in prose and verse, scribed upon the legs of the figure by travellers under the Roman empire, are peculiarly interesting. These are more numerous on the left than on the right leg, and none are beyond the reach of a man standing at the foot of the statue. The earliest were carved in the reign of Nero, the latest In Ihose of 8eptimiu8 Severns and Caraealla, and the most ous (27) in that of Hadrian. Only one Egyptian (who Is responsible for a short demotic inscription) is found among these scribblers, who ahow both more reverence for antiquity and more wit than their modem tativea. At the same time it must be acknowledged that the writinge on the colossus of Memnon are not without scientific value, They were for the most part the work of men of some eminence, including 8 governors of Egypt, 3 epistrateges of the Thebard, 2 procurators, etc, lIany, though not alII are dated.

Thus Lucius Junius Calvlnus aud his wife Minicia Rustica, 'in the Uh year of Vespasian, heard the phenomenon at the second hour, though most other visitors heard it at the morning-hour, i.e. at or soon after 8unrise. The colossus was frequently dumb, in which case the visitor usually waited unlil a more favourable oeeasion. Many were so 8trnck with the phenomenon that they were not eon tent till they had heard it three or four time8. Hadrian, who journeyed through Egypt in 190 A.D., spent several days here along with his wife Sabina and a 1 arge retinue. In his reign a perfect flood of verses spread over the leg8 of the col08sul, most of them by the valn court-poetess Balbi"a, the scondant of a noble house, as she Is careful to mention. One of her ell'usion8 (on the left leg) relates in 16 hexameters, that Memnon greeted Hadrian, as well as he could (ale 8U'''TO') when he perceived the emperor before sunrise, but that a clearer note, like' that caused by a blow on an in8trnment of eopper, was emitted at the second hour, and that even a third sound was heard. Hadrian greeted Memnon as often, and all the world could see how dear the emperor was to the god. 'Balbilla, by an inward impulse stirred' 'Has written all she saw and all she heard'. By far the best verses are those on the front of the pedestal by klepiodolW, who caUs himself imperial procurator and poet. They may be translated as follows: -'Sea-born Thetis, learn that Memnon suft'ered never pangs of dying'. 'Still, where Libyan mouutains rise, sounds the voice of his loud crying' -'()[ountains whieb the Nile-stream, laving, parts from Thebes, the hun-dred-gated)' -'When he glows, through rays matemal with warm light illuminated'. 'But thy son who, never-sated, dreadful battle still was seeking', 'Dumb In Troy and Thessaly, rests now, never speaking'. On the right leg of the colossus is a curious 'Homeric' poem, inscribed by a certain .A,.';u, and made up of four Jines from the Iliad and sey, pieced togetber by the poet 80 as to express hi. meaning: 'Alas, a mlgbty wonder I there behold with mine eyes' (11. xiii, 99) 'Truly a god is here, a noble inbabitant of heaven!' (Od. xlx, 'Loud be raises his voice, and stays the assembled multitude', (Od. xxiv, liOO) 'Never could a mortal man accomplish such a tbing as this'. (Od. xvi, 196). The ruins in the neighbourhood of the colossi are unimportant. About 3 min. beyond them is another Statue of great size, now, hnwever, almost completely covered by arable land. Farther to the N.W. are very numerous smaller statues. The ruined Amm01lhium, at the gates of which the above-mentioned statues stood, has left an important memorial in the shape of a conspicuous colossal stone Stele, erected by Amenhotep III. It now has its broadest surface uppermost, and is covered with hieroglyphics in the grand style, which, with the representations, refer to the dedication of the temple. In the rounded pediment the Pharaoh appears receiving the symbol of life from Ammon on the right, and from Sobr-Osiris on the left; above are the winged sun-disc and the name of hotep III.

Ramaltuffl. THEBES. 18. Route. 159 astronomical representations etc.), others seem to apply much more closely to the temple at Hedinet Habu, built by Ramsea II. who bore the name U"'"1IIa"a "",ramon (Osymandyas) u well as Ramses III. Among these laller points are the lion-hunt on the N. side of tbe temple, the treasury, the aevered limbs, and perhaps alao the temple-library (p. 167). Possibly the explanation is tbat Diodorus wrote his description from memory after leaving Thebes and mingled features of both temples in his account. The traveller will be asaisted to form a judgment on the question for himself by the following main points from the description by rus. 'At the entrance is .. pylon of coloured stone (probably granite is Intended, though erroneously), 2 plethra long (W'l ft.) and 411 ells high. Then follows a sqnare peristyle, with aides measuring 4 plethra (404 ft.). The roof is snpported, not by columns, but by 16 ligures (If living beings, each carved in an antIque style out of a single stone. The entire roof is 2 orgyfa (111/. ft.) broad, and is formed of solid stone, decorated witb stars on a blue gronnd. Beyond the peristyle are another entrance and a pylon, ditTering from the first only in having various figures carved npon it. Beside the entrance are 3 monolithic figures of the Hemnon of Syene (or, according to a better reading 'of stone from Syene'). One of these, a sitting figure, exceeds in size all other statues in Egypt; at its foot (footstool) it measures more than 7 ells. The others, to the right and left respectively of the knees of this statue, represent the sister and mother, and are smaller than the flrst. This work Is not only noteworthy for it. size but deserves admiration also for its artistic beauty. It i. also remarkable for the character of the stone, in which neither a crack nor a flaw is to be seen in spite of its unusual size. -Tbis pylon is succeeded by a peristyle eourt which seems even more worthy of remark than the precedmg. It contains various sculptures carved in the stone, representing the wars tarried on by him (i.e. the king) against the trians, who had revolted against him'. Diodorus farther informs us that the army consisted of 400,000 foot soldiers 
and 20,000 cavalry, in four divisions commanded by the king's sons. On the IIrst wall the king was repreaented storming a fortress surrounded by a river, and hurling himself against the enemy, along with a flerce lion which accompanietl him in battle. .. "In front of the last wall were two monolithic sitting statues, 27 ells in height, and beside these were three exits from the peristyle, ing to a which had the form of an odeum (music-room), and was 2 plethra rlU'l ft.) long cn each side". According to Diodorus this building al80 possessed a library. The lut part of the temple and its npper story are too completely mined to be satisfactorily compared with the report of the Sicilian geographer. We are able to recognize the IIrst pylon, the caryatides in the second peristyle court, the largest colos8us in Egypt, the battle-sculptures with the lion and the fortress surrounded by watcr, the hypostyle odeum, and traces of the library. Diodorus describes them in tolerably correct order, but as vaguely as hasty travellers usually do who are unable to take notes on the spot. We enter the temple by the most easterly of the three extant Pylons. This was originally 220 ft. broad, but its ruined exterior is now more like a quarry than a building. Many representations are still recognizable, though much defaced, on the broad surface of its W. Sid" next the llrst court. Beginning our inspection with the N. Wing (pt a), to the extreme left (N.E.) of the beholder, we llrst notice the slender representations ofpinnaeled Asiatic fortresses, in six rows, the two highest of which have been destroyed. Fourteen of the original eighteen are still recognizable, each with an scription containing its name, and in some cases 
also the year in which it was taken by Ramses II. The isolated inscription at the top, to the left, is translated by Burton, Chamuollion,dlI'Id RWlfch by \...:100(51"-

160 Route 13. THEBES. Wut Batik: as follows: 'The fortress, captured by His Majesty in the 8th year; Shalma (its name)'. Lepsius suggests a different translation. Shalma is perhaps Salem (or possibly I6AufJoa = Hierosolyma 1). The scription referring to the second fortress from the top in the third row to the right, reads: 'Fortress captured by His Majesty in the land of the Amaur; Tapur its name'. The mention of Amaur and the names of the other fortresses seem to refer Tapur to Palestine (a fortress on Mount Tabor), in spite of the natural temptation to connect Tapur with the ancient name of the Tapurs, a people dwelling in the Margiana between Bactria and Hyrcania, and to recall Diodorus's statement that the warlike representations on the tomb ofOsymandyas referred to the campaigns of the builder against the Bactrians. Between the fortresses Egyptian youths appear leading the captured Asiatic princes, most of whom are chained by the neck, though some of them have their hands tied together above their heads. The conquerors accelerate the steps of their unhappy victims with staves, and in the second row from the foot, a young ofllcer is shown plucking the beard of an aged Asiatic. Farther to the right, and reaching to the fallen and more or les8 severely injured summit of the pylon, are some very varied military representations, some of which are unfortunately much defaced. To the right is a realistic battle-scene. l'he Egyptian chariots have overwhelmed those of the Asiatics; and below appear fresh regiments of Egyptian infaritry, marching in step. Each soldier is armed with a lance, a short or curved sword, and a large shield. Before every four soldiers is a non-commissioned officer with a statr. The command to pitch the camp has already been given, and below and to the left of the are men and animals enjoying their earned rest. Weapons and booty lie in heaps; soldiers are drinking from leather-bottles; and others are foddering the horses and asses. The war-llhariots are drawn up in two long lines, and the veterinary surgeon is operating with II pointed instrument on the hoof of an aS8. The camp-police are using their staves, not in jest merely, for beside a man drinking from a wine-skin lire some drunken and roystering soldiers. Immediately above the horizontal surface, whence the broken part of the pylon rises in steps, we see the horses beside the chariots, and the recumbent lighting-lion of the Pharaoh guarding the royal tent. The chariots approach in good order like the infantry; in the lowest row the wheels pass over slaughtered enemies. The live extant rows of chariots excellently illustrate the passage in Exodus xiv, 7: 'And he took six hundred chariots, and all the chariots of 
Egypt, and c&ptains over everyone of them'. The representations on the B. Half of the W ŁŁ ide (Pl. b) of the Arst pylon, also representing scenes from the war with the Kheta, are even more realistic.

THEBES. 13. Route. 161 temple' of Abu-Simbel, p.330.) To the lefi is the storming of Katesh, a fortress on the Orontes, probably situated on an island near J;lums (Emesa). Nearer the centre, ihe king hurries to the fight, with bended bow. Above the rearing and spirited horses, in his chariot are the words: 'The most excellent horse of his mll,jesty Miamun from the stable of Ramses II., the beloved of Ammon'. In the scription within the bent bow the Pharaoh is named the beloved of Mentu, god of war. The royal leader overwhelms his foes with his impetuous attack and hurls them with their horses and chariots into the stream. Some of the Egyptians are put to fiight, and a legion of archers hasten in chariots to the aid of the Pharaoh. Among the slain are various noble Aramaic warriors considered worthy of being specislly mentioned, for their names are inscribed above them. One of these was Khirapasor, historiographer of the Kheta prince, whose dead body is represented beside the hind legs of the king's horses, between two lines of hieroglyphics. A short 12-line inscription in front of the elaborately decorated heads of the king's horses (the bridle is surmounted with lion's heads and feathers) explains the exact episode' here depicted. It is the famous scene that forms the culminating point of the Epic of Pentaur, that tian Iliad, which we have already met with on the pylon at Luxor (p.112)and on the S. wall of the temple of Kamak (p. 141). 'He (i.e. Ramses) halted and encamped to the N. W. ofKatesh. Then he pressed against the worthless foe, the Kheta. He tDas alone and no other tDa, tDith him. He found himself surrounded by 2000 war-chariots, etc.' The escape of the king from his imminent danger by the help of the gods and his own right arm forms the subject of the epic, which has been preserved not only upon the walls of temples but also in a papyrus-roll. Its chief contents have been given elsewhere (p. 112). The relief before us represents this eventful moment in the warlike career of Ramses, while a repetition ofthe same subject on the W. side of the second pylon and the inscription on the architrave in the second court of the temple, inform us that the Ramesseum was erected by Ramses II. as a Building ill gratitude for his deliverance out of the hands of 2500 enemies. To ihe extreme right, in front of the horses of the king, appears first the confused inass of men and horses overthrown by the royal hero. Beside three Egyptians who hold an Asiatic head downward, is the inscription: 'The miserable lord of Khileb (Khalybon-Aleppo). 
His soldiers pull him out of the water into which His Majesty had cast him'. At the end of the relief the prince of the I{heta is shown in his chariot, surrounded by unarmed followers, with the panying words: 'He stands still beside his foot-soldiers and cavalry. His face turned backwards. He advanced no more into tbe battle from fear of His MajestY, when he had seen His Majesty'.-Here as elsewhere the king and his chariot are on a larger scale than the other figures j 'the Kheta prince is smaller BABDBJ<BB'S Upper Egypt. 11

We.t Bmt1c: larger than the other soldiers. -The limestone blocks forming the DOOf'lDay of this sandstone pylon display various sculptures and scriptions, the latter containing the usual dedicatory formulae. The Theban triad (Ammon, Muth, and Khunsu) and another triad consisting of Ptah, Sekhet, and Bathor are among the divinities which here received sacrifices and bestowed gifts. On entering the Firat Oourt (pl. A) we observe that it had on its right and lefi sides a double row of columns, of which, however, only a few scanty remains are to be found on the S. To the W. this space is bounded by the Second Pylon, now in ruins. On the left (S.) stood the 001088U8 of Ramse8 U. (PI. d), the material of which was justly admired by Diodorus (p. 159), and which really may be termed the hugesi statue in Egypt. The remarkable granite statue (not sandstone like the colossi of Memnon) was probably fioated down the river on rafts from Assuln to Thebes. It has been deliberately destroyed (apparently, from the marks at the fractures, by means of damp wedges), though to do so must have cosi its enormous pains. In the time of Diodorus, who visited Egypt about 60 A.D., it appears to have been still uninjured j and we may clude, therefore, that it was destroyed in consequence of the edict of Theodosius, as one of the principal pagan idols. The name of Ramses II. appears in well-preserved hieroglyphics on the upper arm and on the seat of the statue, which lies close by in shattered fragments. It now be put together, as the inhabitants of'Abd el-J5:umah have l)roken off slabs of granits and smoothed them for the purpose of husking their corn. The face is unfortunately pletely destroyed. The remains (breast, upper arm, one foot, etc.) still testify to the care with which this gigantic monnment was chj.selled and polished. The savants of the French Expedition fully measured the various parts, as follows: length of ear 31/2 ft., surface of face from ear to ear ffll/. ft., surface of breast from shoulder to shoulder 281/a ft., from one shoulder to the other in a straight line 211/2 ft., circumference of the arm at the elbow 17112 ft., diameter of the arm between the elbow and shoulder 48/. ft., length of the index finger 81/5 ft., length of the nail on the middle finger 7112 inches, breadth of ditto 6 inches, breadth of the fooi across the toes, 482 fi. The total height seems to have been 571/2 ft., and its total weight over two million pounds.

Ba:mt88eum. THEBES. 18. Boutt. 163 statues of Osiris, whlle on the W. (rear) side, the roof of the colonnaded passage was supported by Osiris-caryatides (facing the court) and papyrus-bud columns. The N. and S. colonnades have almost completely disappeared, but four caryatide-pillars still stand on the E. and as many on the W. Towards the W. end, in the direction of the entrance to the hypostyle hall, afterwards to be described, a number of steps ascend from the pavement of the court to the doorway. Standing in the doorway of the second pylon and looking westward through the central door of the hypostyle hall and through the smaller doorway in its farther (W.) side, we mand an architectural perspective of great charm. The builder has succeeded in producing the effect of distance and size .by raising the iloor-level of the temple towards the W. and by gradually diminishing the size of the doorways that succeed each other in the same axis. In the second court the representations on the W. Wall of the Second Pylon (Pl. e), in front of which rose the E. row of tides, are of special interest. The S. side of the wall has completely collapsed. In the midst of ·the ruins project two blocks of stone, which bear a representation of the fortress of Katesh, surrounded by a blue stream (to the right of the beholder in the second court). To the extreme left, the Pharaoh, much larger than the other warriors, dashes along in his chariot with his bow bent. This is one of the most vigorous of the numerous battle-scenes that have been preserved on Egyptian pylons. The leaping lion beside the king's chariot is part of its adornment merely, though at the first glance it is apt to be taken for the king's battle-companion ing for a 
mighty leap. Diodorus perhaps had this in his mind when he described the relief of a fortress surrounded by water, and the Pharaoh dashing against the foe along with a fierce lion that used to accompany him in battle. The Asiatics fall before the onset of the king like ears of com before a hail-storm. Huddled pell-mell in confused heaps, pierced by arrows or trodden down by the horses, the Kheta fall a prey to death. The Orontes ilows by the side of the combatants and crowds of Kheta are hurled into it j warriors, horses, and chariots sink beneath the waves. We are irresistibly reminded of the crossing of the Red Sea by the Israelites, that took plate only half a century later. 'Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he east into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea. The depths have Clovered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone' (Exod. xv, 4, 6). Farther to the right, beneath the fortress, some soldiers hold out a rescuing band to the ing. Everything indicates that we have here a free repetition of the battle-scene on the first pylon. The battle rages near Katesh, among the slain here also are Khirapasor, the historiographer of the Kbeta prince, his charioteer, Titn,re, ohlef of his attendants, Pisa his master of the horse (Kazen), etc. .

164 Route 13. THEBES. Wat Bank: Bere also appear long rows of chariots, hastening to· the lIght. Most decisive of all, however, is the inscription beside the heads of the king's hOlses, which contains once more the passage from the epic of Pentaur, telling us what event in the life of Ramses was memorated by the erection of the Ramesseum. Once more occur the words: 'He W(l8 alOfte and no other was with him. He found self surrounded by 2500 chariots', etc. n may be mentioned here that a series of monuments of the Hittites (Kheta) with picture-writing (differing from hieroglyphics) has recently been discovered, incluiing several blocks in a bridge at .{lamaA (now in Constantinople) and a silver plate (also fonnd at with the name of Tarr;A;timma in cuneiform and Kheta characters. In 1888 Dr. Humann excavated one of the chief cities of the Kheta, near Binj.rli1 to the N .E. of Antioch. The highly Important inscribed stones ronno there are now in the New Kuaenm at Berlin. On the Upper Part of this pylon we observe the procession of the Festival of the Staircase, in honour of the god Khem (represented in detail at Medinet Habu and described on p. 178). The lIgures which bear the statues of the king's ancestors, should be noticed. The names besides the ancestral images are those of Mena, lIrst king of Egypt, and of the Pharaohs of the 18th Dynasty. From this representation we perceive that the monument is sepulchral. jacent are priests letting fly the birds into which the four children I)f Horus (Amset, Hapi, etc.) have changed themselves, for the pose of carrying tidings to the four quarters of the globe that the Pharaoh has attained the crown of both worlds. Each bird is told whither it must fly. 'Haste, Amset, to the S. and bring tidings to the gods of the S. that Horns, the son of Osiris, has obtained session of the crowns of Lower and Upper Egypt'. In the next line this is repeated with the substitution of Ramses for Horus. The other birds are despatched in similar terms to the N., E., and W. Farther to the right the king appears cutting a sheaf with a sickle, thus discharging the second coronation-ceremony usual at the val of the staircase. Proceeding now to examine the rest of the court, we observe that on the Architrave of the W. Colonnade the space usually devoted to the dedicatory inscription is occupied by lIne hieroglyphics. After what has already been said, it is scarcely surprising io meei once more the famous passage from the epic of Pentaur: -'The king, who abounds in strength, who chastises the barbarians and the world of alien lands, striking them to the earth. He Was alOR4l and no other wal with him. Ramses II., the life-giver, king of Upper and Lower Egypt'. Statues of the king adorned this court, as is indicated by the extant pedestals.

The three Entrances mentioned by Diodorus still exist, and are framed 
with sculptured blocks of granite. The artistic forms displayed in this hall are so extraordinarily congruous with each other, the mensions so skilfully calculated, and the proportions so harmonious, that we describe it as the h!!ll ex-In its arrangiiiIwllt the Karnak.

Two of these (towards the left) are picted on a larger sllale than the others, viz. Kha-em-us, the rite son of Ramses, and Menth, prince of the blood, each oC whom is in the act of slaying an enemy. The younger princes, Meri-Amen, Amen-em-ua, Seti, and Setep-en-Ra. covered with their shields, tske part in the attsck (below the fortress). Diodorus apparently had this scene in his mind when he described the Egyptian army as commanded by the sons of the king. The reliefs at the side of and above the portal (adorned with the concave cornice) in the Rear waU are in good preservation. Each pillar is divided into four fields. In the 1lrst (top) Aelds the king is shown offering to Sokar-Osiris (on the left) and to Ptah (on the right); in both the second fields he offers sacriftce to Ammon Generator; and in the third to Ammon-Ra as king of the gods (left) and to the same god as lord of heaven (right). From the fourth Aelds we learn the use to which the following rooms were put; on the left is enthroned the ibis-headed Thoth-Hermes, god of wisdom and of writings; on the right (opposite) is Safekh, goddess of history (recognizable by the (*, above her head), named here 'the king's mother Safekh, the great mistress of book-writing'. At the foot is the dedicatory inscription, informing us that the king erected this palatial building to his father Ammon, king of the gods and lord of heaven, prince of Thebes. -On each side of the door is a cession of youthful forms, with the lock of hair hanging to the side, peculiar to the royal children. Their left hands are raised, and their right hands hold the herdsman's crook i, the symbol of princely dignity, and the fan l, the symbol of court-rank.

THEBES. 18. Boute. 167 mummy was found in the region of the Apia-graves of Sanbah. There are in all 23 princes, of whom only the thirteenth need 8till be mentioned. After the death of 12 brothers he ascended the throne at a ripe age. As we may gather from the list to the left, this is Merenptah, frequently thongh inaccurately named the Pharaoh of the &odua, whose name as king was afterwards added in the cartonche above him. A similar honour naturally could not fall to any of the other princes. On the columns appears Ramses U. offering. sacriflces to and receiving gifts from the 'gods worshipped in the Ramesseum', conspicuous among whom are Ammon in his various forms, Seth, Thoth, Isis, Mi, Nut, Sekhet, otc. The 8econd 8maller ColoDll&ded Hall (Pl. D), with four couple of papyrus-bud columns, is remarkable for two features. The :first is the roof richly decorated with astrono!llical representations, ing that the Rame888um was a monument dedicated to the worship of the dead. The second is a representation on the N. part of the rear-wall (the S. part is mined), which seems to support the ment of Diodorus that a sacred library was deposited in the tomb of Osym&ndyas, with the legend 'Hospital for the soul' 1'1'tpELo'l). The Pharaoh, with all the royal attributes, sits upon his throne. At his side rises the leafy persea-tree, with heart-shaped fruit, npon which the king's name is being written by three deities, viz. to the left Tum on a lofty throne, to the right the goddess of history, and behind her Thoth-Hermes. Behind Tum are the words: 'Address of Ammon-Tum, lord of the great hall (of Heliopolis), in the Ramesseum to his son Ramses, the belond of Ammon. Up, for distinguishing of thy name to all eternity, that U may be served on the sacred persea-tree'. In this hall also, on either side of the door, is a procession with the sacred boats of'Muth, Khunsu, the dei:fled king, and his consort. The following Boom (pl. E) is much injured, though four lumns are still standing. contains lists of offerings, and a few not uninteresting sculptures (chielly on the door-pillars), which seem still farther to support the belief that we are now in the rooms of a Library. The figures of the Theban triad are not unusual j butthe forms of Safekh, mistress of libraries, and Thoth-Hermes, the celestial scribe (both facing the room we han now entsred) are noticeable. The god is accompanied by a form representing the personified sense of sight, with an eye as his symbol j the goddess by the personified lense of hearing, with an ear above his head. Thoth writes down the resolutions and thonghts of the god, while Safekh, the goddess of history, causes the fame of the great deeds of the past to ring in the ears of posterity. The dedicatory inscription states that this door was overlaid with silver-gilt (electrum), and Champollion found that the very low relief was formerly covered with a cloth ooated with stueco, and was then probably gilded. No traces of the gilding is now to be fonnd. -The side-rooms adjoining this W. DigitIZed by Coogle

Behind the Ramesseum especially towards the N.W., are the remains of a numher of extensive Briel: Building., some of which were erected in the time of Ramses II., as we learn from the stamps on the hricks. Among the rest are some well-constructed vaults. As the tomb of Ramses II. has been discovered al Blban el-Muhlk (p.207), Ihere can he no question of his grave heing here. On the other hand we learn "from the rolls that a celebrated university and a seminary for scholars, comparable to the Museum at Alexandria, were conneeted with the Ramesseum, and stood al the zenith of their prosperity under Ramses and his son ptah. The light-coloured soil, strewn with fragments of hricks and tilesl between the Ramesseum and 'Abd el-Kurnah, covers a multitude Of graves1 whose existence is undreamed of hy Ihose who walk over them. One Of these, belonging to .. certain JI.",a, contains some interesling presentations, the style of which indicates (for no king is named) Ihat it dates proha)ily from the early empire, and is certainly not later than the heginning of the 18th Dynasty. We may therefore conclude that RamS68 II. built his votive Memnonium on an ancient porlion of the Theban necropolis. About 500 paces to the N. of the Memnonium we observe the remains of an extensive wall built of Nile bricks. The name of Tutme8 Ill. found here on many tiles renders it probable that a temple built by this king or dedicated to him stood on this site. 14. The Tombs of 'urnet-Kurrai.

The last have unusually variegated hides, and each has a brown and a black human hand most singularly fixed on the points of its horns. The inscription above this procession runs: 'the great ones of Kush (Ethiopia) speak, Hail to thee, king of Egypt, sun of the foreign peoples. We shall breathe as thou mittest and shall live according to thy pleasure'. In the third row brown and black chiefs from Kush bring gold and precious stones, and semicircular fans of ostrich-feathers, of exactly the same shape as the ft.abellum which now shades the pope on certain -solemn occasions and which was formerly used by the Pharaohs. An ox with artifteially bent horns, between which is a pond with Ash and bushes, should be noticed. The fourth and ftfth divisions are much injured. They show bright red persons (Erythrm&D8 who dwelt between the Nile and the Red Sea), Egyptians, and very light coloured Egyptian women with nosegays, earthen vessels, gazelles, etc. Hui appears again on the same wall.

This bears the name of Medlnet Habu, a Christlan village which arose around and even 
within the ancient sanctuary as early as the 5th cent., and of which considerable traces still remain. On theN. side of the temple-ruins rise heaps of rubbish, which we follow in the direction of the river, until we reach the main which fronts the S.E. and is as imposing as it is curious. The traveller of experience will at once perceive that here we have not to do with a monument erected, like the seum, under the influence of a single continuous impulse, but with a building begun in early times and not completed until the epoch of the Ptolemies. The entire edlftce may be divided into three easily distinguished portions. The earliest of these is the small oblong temple (Pl. N), lying parallel with the N. girdle-wall, and founded under the 18th Dynasty. The most recent is the pylon (Pl. K) adjoining this, with a beautiful and richly adorned portal, seen to especial advantage by those who approach the temple from the plain. A. glance at the capitals of the two large columns rising in front of the gateway and at the style of the inscriptions informs the expert that this ediftce dates from the epoch of the Ptolemies. Reserving these for later inspection, we proceed ftrst to the third portion, the main temple. The MAIN TBMPLE OP MBDror HABu was erected as a uium by Ramses m. of the 20th Dyn., without any reference to the previously existing temple of the 18th Dynasty. Though this temple is beautiful and ftnely proportioned in many of its parts, its architect has displayed 110 skill in incorporating what already existed with the new ediftce. The erroneous opinion that the temple of Medinet Habu was a royal palace must be most emphatically dicted. It was no more a palace than was the Ramesseum or any of the other buildings in W. Thebes. It was a Memnonium devoted to ancestor-worship, and its principal part was intended for the worship of the manes of Ramses III., and to remind posterity of his fame and his exploits.

Here it may be briefiy noted that after the reigns of Ramses II. and his weaker son llerenptah (under Or more probably after whom the Exodus of the raelites took place), rebel. and revolutionists reduced the house of the Pharaoh. to the verge of destruction and inHicted great injury On the valley of the Nile, until Setnekht, a ruler allied to the legitimate line, restored order with a firm hand. After a reign of seven years he died, leaving the once more prosperous kingdom to his son Ramses III. The temple which we are on the point of inspecting is a biographical authority of the greatest value, for its inscriptions and representations not only inform us of the warlike achievements of Ramses III., but enable also the attentive beholder to form a distinel picture of the peculiarities of the public and private life of this prince. Ramses III. is the wealthy Rhampsin!tus of Herodotus, the most splendour-loving of all the Pharaohs, a timid favourite of the gods, whom he endeavoured to propitiate by overwhelming the temples and priestly colleges with gifts, while In the building of Medinet Habu he shows himself to have been a ruler given over to self-indulgence. The victories won under him were important, and it almost seems as though this luxurious ancestor of a degenerate race recovered the manhood of his forefathera amid the tumult of battle. a. Pavilion of Ramie. m. We first enter a kind of FORE-CouRT (PI. A), with two small buildings, which were probably the PO'rte'rs' Lodges. Both these and the girdle-wall stretching towards the S. are surmounted by ronnd pinnacles, resembling those already noted in the pictures 01 Asiatic strongholds stormed by the Egyptian armies (e.g. on the 1st pylon of the Ramesseum). These small buildings bear (behind, above the lintel) the cartouches of Ramses II., Ramses III., and Ramses IV. Passing between the porters' lodges, we are confronted with another building almost in the shape of a horse-shoe, which differs considerably from the pylons of other temples. It consists of truncated pyramids, with almost imperceptibly sloping walls, and a slightly receding central edifice. An excellent slIIvey of this culiar structure, which contains numerons apartments, may be tained from without, as there is an open space of about 35 ft. between it and the entrance between the porters' houses. The French plorers have given this edifice the name of Pavilion, and it is now generally regarded as the dwelling of Ramses III., chiefly on count of the reliefs in the interior representing scenes from the private life of the Pharaoh (comp. p.174). The apartments were probably designed for the reception of the king when engaged in festal celebrations and in ancestor-worship. As has been said before, there were no regular royal palaces on this bank of tho Nile. The royal dwellings looked very different from the temple of Medinet Habu, and were never built of hewn stone. -To the W. opens the Gate a, of lesser height.

Medtmt Habu. THEBES. 16. Route. t 73 and opposite each other, are some curious projecting heads. These are, as is still clearly visible, representations of foreign peoples quered by the Pharaoh, and probably served to support a balcony, or to fasten the velaria which shaded the entrance to the temple. The reliefs on the exterior walls of the pavilion are much mutilated. On the walls facing us as we approach, of the wings band c, we may recognize (towards the top) the Pharaoh, holding a number of enemies by the hair and raising his battle-axe to strike, while mon Ra, on the left, and Harmachis, . on the right, offer him the sword of victory Low down, immediately above the sloping structure, are the captive princes of the conquered peoples. In these, as in all representations of foreign tribes at Medtnet Habu, careful attention is paid to the race-type and the costumes and weapons of the various conquered peoples. Even those who are not Egyptologists will at once perceive that here we have to do for the most part with tribes entirely different from those against whom the kings of the 18th and 19th Dyn. warred. The present pictures present especially the western neighbours of the Nile valley, the Libyans and the allied (and apparently related) islanders of the Mediterranean, who even in the time of Merenptah made an pedition against Egypt, and who after their repulse returned with new and stronger forces in the reign of Ramses III. All are depicted with light complexions, a circumstance as natural in the case of the islanders as it seems strange in the case of the LibYlms. The latter, however, must be regarded as immigrants from the north, among whom the Mashuasha played an important part. Along with the Pelasgians, Etruscans, Danai, Sicilians, Sardinians, Oscans, etc., they were first conquered by Ramses III., and then permitted to take ser¥ice under the Pharaohs, at whose court, especially under the 22nd Dyn., they were destined to play an important part. On the lower part of the E. Wall of Wing c we perceive their raptive representatives beside those of the Libyans and of two other western peoples, whose banner the Ethiopians also followed. On the E. Wall of Wing b are captive princes of the islanders, among whom cially to be noted are the leader of the Zekkari, with a curious hood, the prince of the 'Sardinians from the sea', and of the 'Tursha (Etruscans) from the sea', whose head is adorned with a fisher's cap. Other representations occur to the right and left in the Naf'f'ow Cou,.t, over which the above-mentioned velaria probably extended. As in all other parts of this temple, the deeds of Ramses III. are here celebrated. To the left as we enter, the king, bow in hand, presents to Ammon the conquered tribes, arranged in two columns and bOllnd with lotus-bands.

The INTBJUoll of the pavilion can only be gained from one of the w&1ls of the court to our left as we enter. The attempt is not without difllculty; and Bome of the rooms are not accessible at all. In several of the apartments are well-preserved wall-sculptures of no little intelestj e.g. in the apartment above the passage and in the right wing. RamsesUI. is here represented in hiaharem. Thenude maidens with whom he is playing chess (the scene in the ruined N. entrance-room to the right is well seen from before the of the building), or who hand to him one a IIg, another a pomegranate, another a melon, another a 1I0wer which he smells, appear from the shape of their faces and from the arrangement of their hair to be oaptive princesses rather than his own children. This 8uppoeition is farther strengthened by the occurrence here of several tations of a distinctly immodest character. The vicious propensities of this king are rihbeted with biting scorn on other monuments. He himself appears to "have looked with peculiar pride npon his horem, which was rich In beaut,. of all kinds, and 10 have immor&&lized Its memory in his )femnonium. At all events his reign marks the beginning of an epoch of lUXUry and immorality, upon wbleb deca,. followed close. After passing through the gateway a, we traverse an open Space between the pavilion and the first pylon. Before we reach the pylon, 210ft. wide, which conceals the first peristyle court, we pass a ber of ruined walls of baked and unbaked bricks, which belonged to the Coptic village built within the temple. In front, to the left, is a small Tempk Of Ameniritis (26th Dyn.), to the right. a block with the eartouche of Nectanebus II. Behind is the temple founded under the 18th Dyn., which we visit later (p. 184). Standing on the rubbish heap in front of the first pylon and looking through the gateway into the temple, our view 'penetrates to the last court. There is no more remarkable perspective in Egypt. b.

The value of the booty is here and there indicated, but it by no means corresponds to the gigantic achievements performed by Ramses III. according to the exaggerated representations of his priestly flatterers. There can be little doubt that he successfully opposed a league of several peoples, who attacked his kingdom by land and seal but he did not trate into the heart of Asia as his great ancestors did. and the critic cannot avoid regarding the paeans of Hedtnet Habu as exaggerated and unreliable, The report on the first pylon, referring to the victory of the 7th day of the month Hekbir in the year 11, cOlltains some passages of considerable poetic force: After relating that the enemy had intended to settle in Egypt and to till the land as his own, the aceount goes on, 'Death lurked in Tamer (Egypt) for those, who had come on their own feet to the furnace, in which fire consumed impurity under the glow of the heroism of his who inspired tenor like Baal on lIigh. All his limb. are filled with the power of victory ŁŁ , His right hand grasps multitudes, and over those who place themselves against him his left hand is stretched out like miasiles direeted against them to slay them.

Bnt the God, who knew what was passing in his inmost mind (what was in his intestines). fell upon their heads like a mountain of granite. ŁŁ Their blood mingled with the earth like the ol'erllowing river', etc. . On the S. or Left Pylon are similar representations. Between the two lI.ag-staffs the king appears with his fettered enemies before the god Ptah, who aims a blow at two enemies. Beneath is another horizontal row of ten conquered peoples, and a stele of the 1 '2th year of the king 8mitated from a stele of the 85th year of Ramses II. at Abu-Simbel, containing a dialogue between Ptah and the king. To the left (S.) is a colossalll.gure of Ammon-Ra, handing the sword of victory to the king, beside six fettered enemies. Within the gateway (pl. d) leading to the next court is the name of Ramses m., engraved unusually deeply in the stone. The Pore-court (pl. D), forming an approximate square of 115 ft., is enclosed on all sides, and is not destitute of shade even at midday. On the left (S.) are calyx-columns and on the right (N.) are statues placed against pillars, which form galleries with the outer walls. If we can imagine this space cleared of rubbish and ruined walls, we can form some idea of its pristine effect. Even as it is it impresses the beholder, with its pylons to the E. and W. to shut out the Uninitiated, its colonnades to the N. and S., and its lI.cent decoration in carvings and inscriptions. Here and elsewhere at Medinet Habu we notice that want of symmetry, which is frequently made a reproach to the Egyptian artists; but there Is no doubt that the priestly architects deliberately here placed columns of different forms opposite each other, with the intention of guising or relieving the uniformity dictated by the hieratic canon.

The slaughter which he causes is immense, and, so far as the vividness of the representation goes, may well be pared with the similar subjects at Karnak and the Ramesseum, though it is inferior in point of style. Higher up is an inscription from the 11th year of the king; and here also the long rows of hieroglyphics are more concerned with extolling the king than with relating events. The war is once more against the western peoples, the Libyans, Maxyans (Mashauasha), etc. The leaders of the foe are the Libyan prince Kapur and his son Mishashar. The ponenls of Pharaoh were (according to the inscription on the N.

lion. The endless pictorial laudations of the victor are positively wearisome, while the representations of the defeatl impotence, and throw of the conquered are almost equally abunGant. Finally the king harangues the leaders of his foot-soldiers and charioteers, not forgetting to celebrate in swelling words the deeds that he himself has done. The number of prisoners and slain (the latter with their handa, etc., cut all) is recorded.

Another series occupies the back-wall oC the colonnade on the right (N.) side of the court, supported by seven pillars with the Osiris-figures of the king. The uppermost row contains sacrilleial scenes. Tbe drat of these depicts tbe king, wbo has alighted from his cbariot, sbooting his anows against a hostile fortre.s occupied by warriors (tbe town AfII41'., recalling tbe Amorites). In the next scene the king drags three rows of prisoners behind his chariot. He is congratulated by the grandees. Finally he presents the captives to Ammon, Mutb, and Kbunsu. The inscriptions and sculptures on the Second Pylon (Pl. E), enclosing the rear of the court, are still more interesting. To the left are Ammon Ra and Muth, the great queen of heaven, to whom Pharaoh, wearing a richly decorated crown, leads three rows of captives chained together. The two upper rows have distinctly European features, and wear embroidered aprons and low helmets. Over the 1lrst row no name appears, but according to the inscription before Pharaoh, they are Shakalsha, i.e. probably Sicilians. The captives in the second row are called Tanauna or Danauna, a name in which we are probably correct in recognizing the 'Danai', or Hellenes of the Trojan era. The third row, in which the individual 1lgures resemble those of the other two, is accompanied by the following inscription: 'Provide breath for our nostrils, 0 king, son of Ammon, say the foes from Pulasata'. In these Pulasata we must recognize the Philistines, new and no contemptible foes of Egypt.

In line is the king addresses his faithful followers, telling them that Ammon has lent him his throne, power, strength, and victory. In line 16 the nations that were unable to resist the attack of the islandera are named. Of the latter it is said: 'No people made head against their arms, from the land of Kheta to Kati, Kirkamasha (Karkhemish), Aratu (Arados), and Arasa (Assyria). They assembled In the land of Amara (Amorites ?), they came the people and the land as thongh they did not exist. They came, and a fire was prepared baforehand for those who had turned their faces towards Egypt'. Among these foes, as line 18 reconnts, were the Pulasata (Philistines), Zekkarl (Teuerians ?), Shakalsha (Sicilians), Danauna (Danai)l and Uashasha (1 Oscans according to Chabas). Their hearts were high, an4 they were IIlled with their plans'. But the king of Egypt laid a snare for them. God stood by him. He firmly maintained Zaha (Northern Syria) as his frontier. The battle must have taken place in Egypt itself. The king barred the mouth of the Nile as with a wall with well-mannQd ships, and atlackad the enemy with land-forees and chariots, treading tbem to the ground. The king boasts that he had fonght like Month at the head of his troops, acting like a champion (ustennu), that knows his strength, like a brave warrior, that saves his people in the day of battle. 'Those who reached my borders reaped no more harvests on earth'. He strewed their oorpses along the bank; their ships and goods sank in the waters. 'I made the lands go back, to remember the land of Egypt, ing my name in their lands'. In line 25 he extols himself and claims to have taken their lands from the barbarians, to have made their borders his own, and to have received the homage of their princes. He order. general rejoicing, ealms the hearts of hi. followers, and extols his own strength. At this point the inscription is interrupted by a gap in the fourth, ftfth, .!xth, and seventh courses of masonry from the top. The remainder contains nothing of interest. The granite gateway of the second pylon admits to the Colonnaded ][all (Pl.

Thi8 second court is a specially retired enclosure, in which the 8lightly projecting concave cornice, running round the entire opell space of the square hall, produces the finest effect. It is 126 ft. long and 138 ft. broad. On all four sides is a colonnade. The roof is supported on the N. and S. by columns, on the E. by a row of caryatides, while on the W. the rear 
is closed by a pallsage, with eight caryatide-pillars in front and eight columns hind. An inscription at the top of the inner side of the left (S.) pylon informs us that this was the Festat BaU proper; while the same fact is to be gathered from the sculptures on the back-walls of the colonnades.

It might well be ized in a Memnoniulil, for Khem caused the new birth of the dead god, and the soul separated from the body arose to new life, 88 the vanished orb of night returns at the new moon. As the inscription of Ammon-en-heb says, the heir to the throne succeeded the dead Pharaoh on the following day, just as one moon succeeds another after a moonless night. The inscription above the reUefs would still preserve for us their subject even if the latter had disappeared. It runs 88 follows: 'In the month Pa.khon, at the festival of the god Khem, at the appearance of the light of the Moon-god. The king, crowned with his helmet, comes in his litter. The body-guard goes before him. Each bears at his side shield, spear, and sword. The lords of his retinue, the higher and lower omcers; come behind him, and after them the princes and warriors. The chief orator of vals. (kherheb) conducts the festival of his father Khem, while the king presents to his father Khem great offerings of bread, beer, cattle, geese, and all good things. Khem,. the lord of Sen, is brought forward, and his son Ramses III. adnnees before him. The god wears the double feather on his head, and about his neck a worked chain from which at his left arm hangs the portrait of the goddess Ma. The kherheb strikes up a dance, the choir-master (chief singer) does his duty, 'and the Arabian negro praise the god. Then also appear before the god his vowed servants, with traits of the kings of Upper and Lower Egypt, 88 the divine cestors. No more follows, for the god places himself down upon his staircase, and His Majesty offers a great sacrillce to his father Khem, the consort (bull) of his mother. Behold, there also is the white bull before His Majesty, etc.' ŁŁŁ In presence of the living king and of the royal ancestral images an attendant brings the black blade of a sickle inlaid with gold, and a sheaf of com, and presents them to the king. Then the reaper (mamit), walking round the king seven times, says 'The king has reaped with the sickle that is in his hand, he raises it to his nose, he lays it down before Khem, who gives the king the harvest'.

In the upper row fore the king), a drummer and a trumpeter turn towards the dees of the kingdom, who wear tbe double feather on their heads and carry in their hands the symbols of their power. Tbe last of these, a bald priest, with a censer turns towards the king. A short inscription explains that he is offering incense to the Pharaoh, and names him the fan-bearer at the right hand of the prince, the royal scribe, general, and crown-prince, whom he (Hamses) loves. In the lower row are various dignitaries, preceded by two young princes. These, according to the inscription above, are 'the royal relatives of the king, young and great and wortby, all (who have appeared) to march before his majesty as he proceeds in his litter, in order to cause his father Khem to be carried in procession, at his beautiful festival of the staircase'. Immediately before the king is a priest, turning towards him and offering incense, and then the orator of festivals (kherheb), 'who performs all 
his customary ceremonies before the king at his solemn procession'. Behind the king, the procession is also arranged in two rows. In the upper row are dignitaries, with the symbols of their rank, and armed 'Warriors; in the lower, royal princes, fan-bearers, and pastophori with portions of the sacred staircase and cases containing sacred vessels. At the end of the relief is a kind of grated door, with a vertical inscription in front of it, to the effect that 'His Majesty arises solemnly, like the sun's disc, from his dwelling of life, stancy, aud power (in other 'Words, his palace). The king betakes himself in his litter to the abode of his father Khem, to gaze upon his beauties'. Then follows the main object of the procession, i.e. the image of the ithyphallic Khem, who here stands beneath a r,snopy crowned with Urmus-snakes. Farther on towards the E. waIl, the image appears borne by priests on a stand covered with a gaily-coloured carpet and adorned with enormous wreaths of 1101l'ers. The priests, who wave aloft fans of different shapes, are completely covered by the carpet, with the exception of their heads and feet. Behind and a little above, two priests spread out a sail, the emblem of breath, freshness, and joy, and beneath them four others bear a chest with :five ornamental trees. Before the former :figure of the god the king, offering incense and drink -offering, wears the helmet of the ruler of Upper Egypt; while before the image on the covered stand the Pharaoh, bearing a staff and sceptre and following a white bull, wears the crown of Lower Egypt.

theilrst favourite and queen (whose name, however, is not given in the cartouche in front of her), and of the kherheb, with an open volume, who is called the president of the singers and the chief of festival orators, etc. The hieroglyphics above the bull contain a hymn, in which the kherheb extols the god Khem. And in the inscription turned towards the singer, the praise of the god and of the bull symbolizing him is also sung in words placed in the mouth of the god Thoth. -A 
long train of standard-bearers precedes the bull. Between these and the bull a priest facing the latter, with the censer (the Horuil-hand), and the festival-orator in the act of reciting. The series on the N. wall ends at the tenth standard-bearer, but it is continued withont tion on the E. Wall. Besides the usual emblems, sacrificial vessels, and ancestral statues, images of sacred animals on standards are borne along. The bearers of the hawk, vulture, dog-headed ape, and bull are clad in curious sleeveless garments, covering them from neck to foot. The procession advances towards the Pharaoh, who awaits it, wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, and holding in his hands a staff, arrow, and sceptre. On a table in front of him stands a staff with the double feather, and the sacred wreaths j and before his eyes takes place the ceremony of letting four geese 11y, usual at the coronation of the kings of Egypt. The geese, which here, as in the Ramesseum, have the names of Amset, Hapi, etc., the children of Horns, attached to them, are to announce in all quarters of the globe the accession of the new Pharaoh. The kherheb here appears, declaring that the geese must hasten to the N., S., E., and W., and announce to the gods of those regions that Horus, the son of Isis and Osiris, that the king etc. Ramaes III., has assumed the great crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt. Behind the orator four, and below him three priests carry the images of the predecessors of Ramses Ill., each with its name. Above the first of the men bearing standards with the jackal stands a fignre ping its hands, which is named the Nel}.es en Punt, i.e. the Negro of Arabia, and which is regarded as the personification of the less night preceding the new moon. i'his curious figure greets the god Khem, lord of Senu, etc., at whOle approach every heart pands with joy.

Several boats appear in them, and beneath them (to the extreme left) the festal-barge of Ammon. A dialogue tween the king and the god Ammon, in which the bllilding of the temple is extolled, also occurs here. Oorresponding to the festival of Khem on the N. and E. walls, a FelU"al of Ptah-Sokar-03if'is is displayed in the upper row of the S. and S.E. side of the colonnade. It begins to the left of the door with a train of priests of various forms, bearing standards and arranged in two rows. Next appears the king, to whom incense is oifered, and above whom hovers a vulture. Then follow dignitaries, succeeded by a colossal symbol of the god Nefer Tum, borne by 18 priests. The kherheb reads 16 formnlae of invocation. After him come 16 exalted personages, ineluding the king's sons holding a cord which reaches to the hands of the king. Then follow 16 priests bearing the barge of Ptah-Sokar-Osiris; and ftnaUy the king before Khnum and Ptah-Sokar-Osiris. More interesting than these festal representations are the Waf'like ReUe(8, in the lower divi8ion on the S. and E. walls.

Little of them remained, and the later Pharaohs. and even the Ptolemies and Roman emperors (notably Antoninus Pins) extended the old building. The following description begins at the E. which faces us when we turn to the left (N.) after returning through the gate of the so-called pavilion. The visitor approaching from the Nile is confronted with a some Pylon (Pl. K), to the N. of the entrance to the temple of Ramses. In the centre is a beautiful gateway, with a exeruted winged disc of the sun in the deep concave cornice. The narrow fore-court in front was enclosed under the Ptolemies with columns, of which only the two at the entrance have been preserved (beside Pl. I). In the broader fore-court outside (Pl. H) the touche of the emperor Antoninus Pius occurs several times. The large Pylon (Pl. K) dates from the late Ptolemaic epoch, for it hibits Ptolemy Soter n. Lathyrus worshipping the gods; but it cludes stones from an earlier edilice, some of which are upside down and some show detached fragments of inscriptions (e.g. sacrilicial lists, with the names of Ramses n.). Beyond the is a Chapel (pl. L), only 30 ft. long, dating from the reign of Nectanebus II., who was acknowledged as king by the Egyptians in the middle of the Persian epoch. The rooCwas supported by eight columns which, however, have disappeared, leaving only the low walls which nected them like screens. Immediately adjoining the chapel is a Second Pylon, 50ft. wide, which was erected under Taharka the Ethiopian (25th Dyn.) and renewed and provided with inscriptions by Ptolemy Lathyrus. On the front of this pylon appears anebus n., on the back Taharka. Beyond this is a ruined Court (pI.

Ptolemy Euergetes II. occurs in the upper Inscription running round the celIa. The building, though small, is distinguished by its harmonious forms. About 65 paces to the N.E. is the well-known Fresh Water Spring, a pool to which a subterranean passage leads. It Is a markable fact that the freshness of the water remains entirely atrected by the saline exudations from the ground, even in the cropolis at Thebes. To the S. of the temples of Medinet Habu are traces of a Saered Lake of considerable extent, formerly taken for a hippodrome. At its N.W. angle is a small temple, now known as el-'Agtlt;, erected by Ptolemy Euergetes II. to his ancestors. It consists of a wide vestibule and three rooms, one behind another. StiU farther to the S., at the S. W. angle of the former lake, stood a small tuary dating from the Roman period. It was erected by Hadrian and Antoninus Pius, while the ruined pylon bears the names of Vespasian, Domitian, and Otho, the last of exceedingly rare rence owing to the emperor's short reign (69 A.D.). The temple consists of a cella surrounded by apartments. A staircase leads to the roof from a space to the extreme left of the entrance.

TombB of the Qutem. THEBES. 16. Route. 187 20 have been discovered, many of them untlnished and 
entirely without decoration, and in their rough and blackened eondition, resembling mere caves in the rocks. It is rare to tlnd either scriptions or representations carved in the stone j even in the tlnest tombs the limestone walls were more often covered with plaster which could be adorned with paintings without much diftlculty. Of the two tombs which we reach tlrst, the second only (to the W.), that of a queen of Ramses nI., is preserved. Her name is no longer legible, but only those of her husband and her son ammi-f. The tomb consists of an chamber and a large hall with 4, pillars, in the midst of which is the broken phagus. The next three tombs, of which the farthest belonged to a Queen Sitra of the 20th Dyn., need not be visited. But of the four on the side of the valley next reached, the second and the tlrst deserve notice. The former is the Tomb of Queen Tit! (1 Jl ). It lies on the S. side of the valley and consists of the usual antechamber (Pl. 1) open to the N., a long passage (Pl. 2), and a large chapel (Pl. 3) with a small chamber on each of its three sides. In this as in most of the better preserved tombs of the Queens the a 2 11 1 freshness of the colour is extraordinary. On the left wall (Pl. a) of the Passage 2 we see the queen before Ptth. Ra Harmachis, the genii of the dead Amset and 'fuamutef, and Isis j on the right (PI. b) THY with the sistrum stands before Thoth, Tum, Hapi, Kebsenuf and Nephthys. Ptah is placed opposite to Thoth, Ra Harmachis, i.e. the morning sun, to Tum, i.c. the evening sun, the two genii of the dead Amset and 'fuamutef to the two others Hapi and senul, and lastly Isis to her sister N ephthys. As a border above the ligures runs an inscription from which we learn that TItI was the daughter of a king, the sister and the mother of a Pharaoh, and queen of Upper and Lower Egypt, and that she received in the other world a friendly welcome and all that is wished for the dead. The name of the wife of Amenhotep III., which often occurs on scarah ... i, is also mentioned on the cuneiform tablets recently discovered at TeU el-Amarnah. She was perhaps the daughter of a Babylonish king. This wonld aeconnl for the reddish skin and blue eyes with which she is represenled here. In the passage leading to Room 3 are at Pl. c the Goddess Isis (Selk with the scorpion on her head), and at Pi. d Neith, 'the great lady of Saia, the mistress of heaven, and princess of the Digitized by \..:.OU1 ·It:

In the innermost Chambe" 6 Osiris sits enthroned as supreme judge to whom Selk conducts the queen. Behind him are Nephthys and Thoth. On the walls e and f are tables of offerings on which, by tbe side of distributions of bread etc., lie masses of flowers far larger than are found in the tombs of men. In the Side-cOOmber .. we see the Hathor cow, richly decorated and standing out of a ground of radiance and flames of 1lre painted with dazzling colours. This painting, which meets us several times in the tombs of the Queens, represents Hathor as a goddess of heaven and especially of the horizon. She is the cow which in the lower world gives birth to tbe young Sun, who begins his active life with flame and light. On the right close to the tomb of Titi lies that of Queen Ilia, ( ] : J1 J Alt, wife of Ramses IV. (Nefer-\tak-an) of the 20th Dynasty. The entrance is fllled up, and the inscriptions are much injured and covered with debris. In the inner room ing to room 3 in the tomb of Titl stands a broken granite phagus. On the W. side, running parallel to that just described, the flrst tomb approached from the N. is in ruins; close to it is that of a queen, whose name bas been obliterated, and in its place another written with ink, apparently to be read Tuattent Apt. In this the first and third rooms were supported by pillars. The names are on the inner wall of the second room. The inscriptions were incised. The two tombs beyond were the resting-places of another princess, the favourite daugbter of Ramsos II., Bant anJa, and of Amen-meri, i.e. the beloved of Ammon, the latter consisting of a principal hall with a chamber behind and on each side. Contrary to custom the shaft is on the left of the entrance in front of the principal hall. 17. D&r el-lledineh. No one should miss seeing the beautiful small Plolemaio lemple of Dcr el-Medineh lying to the N.W. of Medinet Habn. It lies on Ihe way to ShCkh 'Abd el-Knrnah either from Medinet Habu or from Ihe Tombs of the Queen.. From' Medinet Habn we reach el-Medineh in 20 minutes. On the way from tbe Tombs of the Queens to Del el-Medineh, we pass (1/4 hr.) a billside with some remarkable historical steles of the 18th, 19th, 
and 20th Dynasties. On one appears King Ramses III. before Horus, and his father Sei--nekht before Ammon. Another contains an account of the campaigns of the former king. The graceful Temple ofD6r el-Kedtneh was founded under the Ptolemies for the worship of the dead, and dedicated to tbe goddess Hathor.

De.. el-Medfneh. THEBES. 17. Route. 189 DoOftOlIfI ofstone (on the S.E.), by which we have to pass, leads into the temple, at the back of which (N.) are steep rocks. The ary was founded by Ptolemy IV. Philopa.tor I., and sculptures were added by others of the house of the Lagidm, and later also by the Emperor Augustus. The naveller on passing through the doorway in the outer wall sees on his left an arebway of Nile bricks, and before him the front of the temple of freestone, on which many Greeks and Copts have written their names. In Christian times it was used by the monks as a dwelling-place, and to this is due the mutilation of many of the inscriptions and also its present name (DGr = monastery). We first come to a small hypmthral Antechambet' with 2 columns, and a few steps further reach the true Ptolemaic trance of the Naos. This is ornamented by two pilasters with masks of Hathor, and two columns with sculptured calyx-capitals in the middle, which 
support the architrave and are connected by walls sembling screens (reaching half-way up). Between the pillars is a semi-portal similar to the one at Medamlit (p. 161). The pilasters are brightly coloured and peculiarly ornamented, with a 10tusllower and a bud on slender stems at the side. Above are Urmus-serpents with the crowns of both kingdoms. On the left side is an elegant window which lights a staircase. The inner portion of the temple is in three parts. Over the door of the middle room, the. sanctuary, are placed 7 masks corresponding to the number of the Hathors. Euergetes 11. and his wife are named as beautifiers of the temple, and the four sacred bulls, Hapt, Urmerti, Temur, and Abekur, are portrayed. In the cell to the right is the king before the various gods of the lower world, and also an astronomical painting, Sothis (Sirius) and Orion. In the room to the left, on the left wall, is a remarkable tation of the judgment of the Dead. The valley of Der el-Medineh is rich in Tombs ofvmous periods, some of them early and of great interest, with the colours of the paintings marvellously preserved. Here was discovered the well-known colleetion of Paprri, obtained by ..t. C. Barril in 18IiIi, containing the famous papyrns of Ramses m. (see p. 1'20). the largest known, from the archives of the temple of net Habn. The earliest tombs here belong to the beginning of the New pire and to the times of Aahmes I. and Amenhotep I. They longed to great offtcials, especially to the Sotem-as, supreme judge at the Seat of Truth, possibly a college which met at Dot neh. We may mention the small brilliantly coloured chapel of tho royal8cribe, Meara, the similar one of Khii, the tombs of Amenme8, Zeaken, and Amenhotep.

With this part of the Necropolis of Thebes, which may be reached from Der el-Medineh in 2Ii min., we conclude our IIrst day on the W. bank in our three days' plan. Gaze's tourists make it their second day, Cook', begin their third day with the Ramesseum (R. 13) and the tombs of 'Abd el-Kurnah, as in our live days plan. The tombs to be visited may be founa without a guide. They are reached by ascending the E. side of the Libyan mountains In a direct line from the R&messeum. )[any of the tombs here are inhabited by fella\lin. The sepulchral chambers serve as dwelling -places, wooden doors are hung in the entrances, and the fore-conrt is often enclosed by a clay wall for the conllnement of their live stock. In front of most of these eave-dwellings stand covered linders like gigantic mushrooms, of Nile mud and straw kneaded gether. These are the primitive granaries of the inhabitants of 'Abd Kurnah, several of whom are well-to-do, with honses of Nile bricks, spicuous from a considerable distance. Those who are desirous of staying any length of time should make arrangements with the wealthy and worthy Copt, To<l, ... " uncle of the German consular agent at Luxor. The tion of a house for travellers has been under consideration, and wonld b. of especial benefit to scholars by sparing them the daily journey to and from Luxor. Shelter may be found In the house of Mo\lammed 'Abd er-Rasul, provisions being brought from Luxor. Several Enropean ars have chosen 'Abd-el-Kurnah as their centre for investigations on the W. bank, among them Champollion, Wilkinson, Lepslus (whose lodging in the tombs is still known by t.he fellal?in as the Lepsius), Prlsse d'Avennes, and Ebers. The visitor to the tombs must first face some savage dogs, but he will be thoronghly repaid partly by the interest which some of the tombs afford, and partly by the magni6cent Ł Vi ... which is obtained from those in the higher positions, especially at sunset. In this part of the Necropolis of Thebes were burled the wealthy nobility of the 18th Dyn.! upon whose tombs large sums of money must have been spent. The inserlptions record that the deceased were In their life-time invested with the highest spiritual and temporal dignities and that they enjoyed almost royal estates, their pride in which they show in sculptures and inscriptions. However death is not forgotten in these tombs, for there is no lack of funereal epitaphs. In almost all of them too we lind logical tables, by which we learn that many of those bnrled here were related to each other. The more important tombs were numbered by Wilkinson, but most of the ligures have been obliterated. In 1880 Prof. Eisenlohr renumbered the tombs, In all 127, including those with no inscriptions. In the Ing description! of the tomb. reference is made to these nnmbers, which appear in the adjoining small plan. If time i. limited, it will be cient to visit the tombs of Kha-em-\Jit, Ramses, Nekht, Sen-nefer, Anna, Horemheb, and Ramenkheperseneb. The traveller is recommended to begin with two tombs on the eastern side of the hill behind the Ramesseum. The one to the left is that ofRha-em-hiLt e c:==..db A§\ (No. 120), 8uperinten-. --D dent of the royal granaries, of the time of Amenhotep III.

The chess-board decoration of the ceiling is peculiar. In the entrance to the second hall on the right, there is a long 16 column inscription of deeply-cui hieroglyphics. In the second hall are several chapters of the Book of the Dead (110, 112). The sides of the third hall are destroyed, the fourth wa. entirely without inscriptions. To the right at no great distance ill a tomb ftrst opened in 1882 (now No. US), known as Btuart'. Tomb from its discoverer Villiers Stuart. It belonged to Ram.", a mayor (mer nut zet) and his sister Ptahmtf'it, of the time of Amenhotep IV., the sun-worshipper, who, as Khu-en-aten (splendour of the sun) removed his residenee to Tell el-Amamah (see p. 22). Here as there the sun is represented with his rays spread out as hands protecting the king and queen. Proceeding a little farther to the N., we soon reach the tomb of NeUt (No. 125), 1\rst opened in 1889 (the door unlocked on quest) with representations of fowling, wine-pressing, etc. j the drawing is rough but the colours fresh and well preserved. We then climb the somewhat steep hill and, passing the richly decorated tomb (No. 119) of Amenu8et", who lived under Tutmes III., come to that marked No. SO. Khamsatelatin, by Wilkinson, at one time considered the most worth visiting of all. It consists of a vestibule, and a large chamber from the centre of which an unusually long passage of remarkable and gradually increasing height runs into the rock. It was laid out by a prince, governor, etc., nsmed Relth-ma-ri, who died in the time ofAmenhotep 11., the successor of Tutmes III., when the tributes of Asia were 1\owing into Egypt in exceptional abundance, to the benefit of the relations and favourites ofthe royal family. The pictorial decoration of the wan. can now be lCareely seen, and e&n be much better studiejl. in Ihe works of Wilkinson and Hoskins (Ethiopia). The tomb served as the abode of old Husen Ba.,lr, the panlon of Harris and Lepsius, and is a convenient room for luncheon. 'rhe Opport\lnUy should be taken of looking at the faded Minlings of the left corridor, and of the passage into the rock. They represent 
payment of tribute by the Ethiopians (Punt, Kefa) and Asiatics (Retennu), various kinds of work such as brick-making for building, pottery, carpentry, joinery, glasa-blowing, carving and polishing of statues, and a company of mourner. with harpers and women playinc

(Arkes antes) il also found here. To the right, immediately above the tomb of Rekhmari, is that (now No. 01) of Amuzeh, superintendent of the palace under Tutmes III. and Amenhotep II. This also consists of a large bule with niches in the sides, and a rather long passage cut into the hill. The representations on the inner wall of the vestibule are worth ticing. On the left are the African tribes bringing in their tribnte .sisting of gold, ivory, apes, panther·skins and the like. On the right is the tribute of the Asiatics, jars, a carriage, a white and a brown horse, and various weapons. In both corners of the vestibule were sWes, of whieb only that on the right haa been preserved containing a prayer to Be in the name of the deceased. On the right-hand side of the long sage into the hill is a seene illustrating the chase of waterfowl. To the right close to No. 51 is the tomb of Amen-Im-hlb (No. 36) known to Ohampollion and described by Ebers and Stem. It sists of two halls one behind the other, of which the length is at right angles to the passage between them, &Ild of a chamber behind the second hall.

The pavilion has a natural connuion with the picture of Anna's gardenJ as he was a zealous planter of treea. A number of the plants cultlvat84 by him are named, and to this we owe our knowledge of the name. and characters of several of the plants of ancient Egypt. On the long outer wall, on the left, we see the noble Anna again, this time atanding upright, in full enjo1D'ent of his rank, while receiving the different kinde of tributes for the houses of Ammon. There are scribes to take down the amount of each contribution, and even the number of strokes which are indicted upon a debtor. From Ethiopia there is a variety of contributions to be received, including negress slaves carrying their children in baskets on their backs, ivory, ebony, apes, panther-skins, etc. The Asiatica bring lapis-lazuli, etc. On the same outer wall but to the right of the spectator Anna i. seen again, but this time In company with his united family. lila hound is atanding below his seat, while ostriches, wild aS86s, a kind of wild goat, and other goats and cattle of various kinds and colours are being brought to him.

The innermost room of No. 26 together with the shaft haa been lI11ed up with stones, and all that can be recognized of ite paintings is the back of an enormous Apep serpent, the enemy of the Sun-ship of Ra. We flotice the two long galleries to the left with numerous trances but without any remarkable tombs, and ascend again to the right to No. 16, a tomb well worth seeing, belonging to Horemheb, who seems to have held a series of omces, especially that of overseer of the cattle, in the successive reigns of Tutmes II. and m., hotep II. and III., and Tutmes IV., of the 18th Dynasty. Clo88 to it is the tomb (No. 17) of fauna, a fan-bearer on the king's right hand, and adjoining this, but turned towards the N., the tomb of Amaophil (No. 102), second Prophet to Ammon, and of his wife Roi. The paintings in this contain a scale in which gold rings are being weighed, various workmen, one of whom is making a sphinx, clerks with tables writing out the crops, and a statue with a ram's head; on the right music and dancing. A little higher to the right fa the tomb of ZaDuni (No. 11»). Care should be taken at the entrance, to avoid falling into the deep ahaft. The paintings represent Retennu bringing presents in gold, sflver, lazuli, and emeralda. We have now almost reached the summit of the hill, and can enjoy the magniftcent *View including the Ramesseum, the Memnon statues, and on the other lide of the NUe Luxor and Karnak; to the righi below the hills is seen the temple of Der el-ba1}.ri, and the path leading to the Tombs of the Kings.

THEBES. 18. Route. t 95 No. 26 (see above) to the tomb of Bamenkheperaeneb (No. 34), which, having been opened only for a few years, is remarkably well preserved and is well worth a visit. For stout people, however, the entrance is almost too narrow. The deceased was chief architect to TutmesIII. The right hand inner wall of the large hall tells us of the important works which were 
entrusted to him, such as the carving of a statue of the king from a single stone, the erection of a hall of pillars, and of numerous obelisks. Here again we see tribute being brought by princes, of Keftu (the Phrenicians), of Kheta, Tunep, Kat, Katesh, etc. The arms and helmets of the their carriages and handsome vases are remarkable. Near this, a little to the right, is the fine and well-preserved tomb (No. M) of emha, the scribe of the harvest, in which should be noticed the harper and the long list of relations of the deceased, whose father and mother were named Tutmes and Entef. In a passage there are represented barges with mummies of himself and his wife Bekt. In the last chamber there is a Stele of the 28th year of Tutmes III. The shaft in the tomb contains a large room covered with writings Still farther to the right is the tomb (No. 60) of a prince (erpa-hi) Bntefa.ker, and on the N.E. slope that of Amlthent, the son of Auta, which was completely excavated in 1883. A descent should now be made to the gallery, in front of which is seen WiUcimon', Howe, and to the tomb (No. 88) of Imaileb, who was scribe of the altars of sacrifice under Ramses IX. (Neferkara). The festal barges with the name of the king should be noticed, as well as the many golden utenails, and the money-bags, and also a series of kings, among whom appears King Raskenen, who fought against the Hyksos, and whose remarkable mummy is in the museum at Gizeh. We now descend to the plain, where there are a few more tombs to be seen in the direction of el-Asasif, including that of Ieter-, hotep, who Dved under King Horus, the last of the 18th Dynasty. In this should be especially noticed the funeral processions by boat which have been copied by Wilkinson ( Mannet'8 and CU8t0m8). The funeral services are also recorded. We have to crawl through the entrance which is choked up. The ceiling is decorated, and has a regularly recurring aeries of hieroglyphics signifying 'First' and 'Prophet'; the deceased in fact held the office Prollhet of Ammon. The family scene in the flrst room explains itself; the 59 rows of hieroglyphics above record the names of the relations of the deceased, who on the left are paying homage to King Horus with whom they were closely connected. In the second room we see Ne/er-1I0ttp, sitting by the side of his sister who is adorned with flowers. hind them is an ·1 ... <rlpt4Dn which indicates that distinguished Egyptian families kept private bands of music; and it may be that the special duty of the harper whose song has been handed down to posterity by this Inscription, was to gladden the hearts of the family when they were assembled in thelr ancestor's tomb for the solemnities in his honour. The song is not In any way of a mournful character, and it is clear that in the time of the Pharaohs, it was a pleasure to be reminded in the tombs of the shortness of lifel and the duty to enjoy it, so long as it lasted.

II>. 196 Boute 18. THEBES. . Wut Bank: the tomb of Osiris, of the righteous prophet of Ammon, Neferhotep'. After an introduction, wishing peace to the dead, and glorifying Ule IUn-god, it continues literally as follows: 'Celebrate the great daYl 0 prophet. Well is to thee, fragrant resin and ointments are laid berore thee. Here are wreaths and flowers for the waist and shoulders of Uly sister, who is pleasant to thine heart, as she rests beside thee. Let us then sing and strike the harp in thy presence. Leave all cares behind and think of the joys, until the day of the voyage comes when man casts anchor on the land which delights in silence'. Near this is the once splendid tomb of another Neferhotep, seer of the. cattle of Ammon, but now in ruins and used as a zine by the keeper of the Gtzeh museum. There may also be nsited in the neighbourhood the tombs of KherO.f, of the time of hotep m., of Moi, and of an official in charge of the stables of Amenhotep II., the inner room of which is the resting place of Mahu, a writer of the treasury in the time of Ramses II.

To the W. bank as on the previous day, see p. 152. From the landing-place of the ferry we ride across the fields in a northerly direction and in 3/, hr. reach the handsome *Temple, the front of which with its columns is visible at a considerable distance. The original building (see the annexed plan) was of smaller dimensions than the Ramesseum and Medinet Habu, its complete length being 518 ft., and of this only the actual sanctuary with its halls and chambers, 153 ft. in depth remain, while there are only scanty remains to prove the former existence of two Courta and the Pylon. which enclosed them. The Sphim:u which were placed like dians to the right and left of the door leading into the first Court on the inside, are half covered with earth. They were placed there by Seti I., and on the bases were inscribed the namell of all the nations whioh he had oonquered. Of all the buildings in the POli8 of Thebes, this one most reminds ·U8 of the Memnonium of Abydos (p. 54), and a closer inspection of the style of inscriptions and presentations will both bring out and explain their similarity, for the temple ofJS:urnah was founded by Seti I., the builder of Abydos, and both the sanctuaries were restored and completed by Ramses II. They·both served the same purpose, as a place where the manes of the founder might be remembered, and offerings made.

Moreover in the Memnonium also Seti I. with :O.1ial piety thought of his father Ramses I., the ceased Ramses Ra-men-pehti. To him are especially dedicated the sculptures on a false door, which is reached by passing through the left entrance door from the colonnade on the last facade, and crossing the hall with two columns and the long chamber lying hind it. On the inner wall of this last, on the right and left panels of the false door referred to, ses 1. is seen enthroned as 'King Osiris', and from two inscriptions between these which are divided by ornaments and two others which frame the whole, we leam that Seti I. dedicated this portion of his Memnonium to the memory of his father. His son .....-= -= did for him what he had done for his father, while later kings, Merenptah, Siptah, and Ramses III., had their names carved in various places, but do not seem to have either restored or enlarged the Memnonium. The traveller should especially notice the ordinary beauty and purity in style of the inscriptions and ings. The existing remains of the temple of may be divided into four parts: 1, the colonnade on the front of the temple facing the E.; 2, 3 and 4, the three series of halls, chambers, and closets separated by partition-walls, one in the centre, one OIi the left, and one on the right. The Colonnade (PI. A) originally displayed 10 tine columns with papyrus-bud capitals, excellent specimens of this order, but of these one on the S. side (left) has been destroyed. In its inner wall, the eastern wall of the temple, are three doors (PI. a, b, c), which lead into the three serIes of rooms mentioned above, and the sculptnre on it is of great interest, representing 12 pairs of divinities, each a god and a goddess, eight of which may tainly be taken to represent branches of the Nile forming the Delta. On their heads they carry well-known geographical symbols. Of each pair it is said that they come in order to bring gifts to Pharaoh. The dedicatory inscription reads: 'The saying of the gods and the goddesses of the north to their son etc., Ramses II. We come to thee, our arms are laden with choice goods and produce. We thered for thee all good things from all that the earth brings forth, to place the temple of thy father in a festival of joy .Ł.

Here the dedicatory Inscription tells us that Setl I. set this up to Ammon-Ra, the lord of the throne of the universe, in the region of Ammon of the western Thebes for millions of years etc., and that his son Ramses II. was the restorer of this building. 'Not all bis works', it literally continues, 'were ftnishl'd in writing or in hollowing out. So bis son, the lord of both worlds, (81l! 0)1 RamsesU., commanded to build up everlasting buildings in his temple opposite to eastern Thebes' etc. Passing through the middle door(PI. b) of the colonnade, we enter a kind of Hypoatyle with 6 papyrus-bud columns (PI. B). This is bounded on each side by three chambers, and beyond the last pair of these expands to their full depth. It is considerably smaller than other similar halls, measuring only 50 ft. by 35 ft. A part of the roof has fallen in, on the slabs which are preserved are the ture forins of Hebent (Nekheb?) and two inscriptious. On the right is the ordinary dedication of the building, on the left a special mention of this hall, which like all similar ones is called' The HaU of Appearance'. Everywhere we see on the walls Seti I. offering incense to the gods of Thebes, and bringing the symbol of his name, and ilowers etc. On the right and left of the door Seti I. meets us as a boy, with Muth on the one side, and Hathor on the other giving him the mother's breast. The young prince already wears the helmet and holds the symbol of princely rank r Hathor with the horns of a cow and the disc upon her head, SllPPOrts with her right hand the nourishing breast, and says: 'I am thy mother, who fashions everything that is perfect. Feed thyself with my milk'. Besides the Theban triad are mentioned Hathor as goddess of the western horizon, Isis, Tum, Ptah, and Anubis. The Friese of the Hall of Appearance displays the name and surname of Sen I. stantly repeated. Several inscriptions show that Sen left this hall unilnished, and that Ramses completed what his father had begun. In the adjoining rooms there are several clear references to the cultus of the dead which was celebrated here. In hall C, which is supported by 4 pillars, we see Seti I. before a Naos with the boat of Ammon-Ra. The series of chambers to the left divides into two parts: a Hall (pl. F) with 2 pillars, into which three long rooml open, while behind are three running parallel with the axis of the temple, and three in a N. and S. direction, which are reached by a pusage from the extreme left of the inner wall of the colonnade.

Temple of 8eti 1. THEBES. 19. Routt. 199 The right hand portion of the temple coneisted of a long HaJJ. (Pl. E) with 10 columns (no longer standing), and of Ave rooms behind, three larger and two smaller, originally separated from it. The sculptures of this part are of the time of Ramses II., and far inferior to those of the central building and left hand portion of the sanctuary. A little to the N. of the temple is a water-wheel and spring with some ,Ullt trees, used as a watering-place for cattle. Palling this we leave to the left the Bide of the Libyan mountains with the Necropolis of Df'ah Abu" Neggah, and continue directly by the lower path to the valley of the Tombs of the Kings. Drah Abu'l Jreggah is one oC the oldest cemeteries of Thebes, and the treasures discovered by Mariette's excavations have been of ordinary value, but tbe tombs are now ll11ed up, and tbe traveller will llnd nothing unless be excavates for bimself. Tombs of the 11tb, 17tb, and 18th Dynasties were discovered bere, and in one of tbem was tbe mummy of <I.,.", .4ah-hot.p, whose precious ornaments are preserved in the Gi.eb Museum (Vol. I., p.802). In her time it was tbe custom to pay more attention to the decoration of tbe dead body than to tbat of tbe tomb. Tbe Necropolis of Drab Abu'l Neggab was a source Qf plunder from a very early time.

Beyond a rocky ravine we reach an open space, whence two roads dwerge. That to the left leads to the mblln d-Muhlk proper, visited by all travellers; that to the right to the W. cross-valley of the gorge of the Kings' Tombs. The latter route describes a wide curve round the greater part of the Biban el-Muhik and leads past steep crags, on which hundreds of vultures perch in the afternoon, to two Kings' Tombs. We reach the valley of the Tomb of Ai (Arab. Turbet et-{(unld or Tomb of the Apes) by the route leading to the right from the open space, or by a very difAcult path (not reoommended) over the mountain (between Nos. 8 and 9). -Visitors who are pressed for time may content themselves with inspecting Tombs Nos. *9, ·11, ·17, *6, 8, and 14 j Cook's tourists visit Nos. 2, 6, 9, 11, 17, and lunch in No. 18.

Pau8anias, .Elian, Hcliodoru8, Ammianus Marcellinus, and other ancient authors refer to them as the 8yt'inge. (a6pt'I'TEt;) of Thebes, which name also occurs in the Greek inscriptions within the tombs. The word 'Syrinx' meant Ilrst a shepherd's pipe formed of longish reeds, then it came to mean a hollow passage, and thus was applied to the long rock-hewn passages of Bibln el-Mulll.k. These tombs and the subjects represented in them require some words of explanation. The tombs which are in good condition and cessible are Nos. 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 17; the rest either contain only t he name of a king, or are unsafe owing to snakes (e .fI. No. 7) or are simple passages cut in the rock. PI"" .... d A,.,...,.fI ....... '. Nos. 1 and 2 simply consist of a passage, a hall for the sarcopbagus, and an Inner room. Of the rest only Nos. 9 and 11 are completed. In the Ilrst the plan is most clearly seen: 1) three long halls, 2j a square hall, 5) Ilrst smaller hall with pillars, .) one or two inclined oblong halls or paasages, II) a square room, 6) a second larger hall with pillars, the hall of the sarcophagus, in the corners of which are side-chambers, ·7) at the end another square or several oblong rooms or paasages. -The Ilrst hall with pillars has also a side-chamber to the right, as in Nos. 8 and 11, and with some variation, in No. 17. The roof of the second is supported by 8 pillars, and aa in No. 17 may also have an adjoining room on the left. From the plan of No. 14 we conclude that this tomb waa intended for several persons, aa there are two sarcophagus-halls. The tombs of the 18th Dyn. were arranged quite differently from those of the 19th and 20th. In those a sloping passage leads into the square s&reophagus-hall, and adjoining this is a second hall with pillars, the entrance to which is placed six feet above the ground. -The oblong rooms usually contain niches, which were hewn in the stone at four to six feet above the ground, possibly for the keeping of sacrillcial vessels. All the tombs slope downwards Into the rock, except Nos. 1,2, ,. and 14; in those of 8<1i I. (17) and of Ai we dnd a flight of well·worked steps at the entrance, while in the others the descent is made by inclined planes. Although the generailian Is the same in all, and the dilference in size seems to have depende only on the amount of time and money which each Pharaoh waa able to give to the work, there is no similar arrangement of Inscriptions and representations; in fact only a certain general resemblance can be observed, though the inscriptions vary not In sense or even in words, but only in quantity. The .tyle is often matical and the interpretation of both the aign. and their meaning i. extremely dinlcult. The following is a brief account of the tions and repreaentations. In the drat place there is cut in the wall a long hymn to Ra in Amenthes or the lower world, which reeounta the 7. forma of Ra with the invocation: 'Praise be to Ra, the Almighty!' Then it is said that the king knows the 74 forms of the god by name. The works of Ra are farther glorided, and his victories over his foes. In front of this hymn there i8 u.ually repre.ented an antelope's head with a serpent beside it above the disc, and an antelope's he&d with a crocodile below. It is usually found in the /lrat oblong hall} aa in Nos. 2, 8, 11, 111 and 17. The texts are more or le81 injured or aefective, and it haa been the task oflO[.

Dra1a Abu" Neggah. THEBES. 19. Boute. 201 Ammon-Ra is the lord and master of the throne of the universe, the living and God of heaven. These tbree form a trinity whicb is the deity of Blban el·Huhlk, and Is worsbipped in Amenthes, as we lind represented in every tomb. Here also Isis and Nepbthys mourn for tbe dead, and worship tbose who bave become Ita of Amentbes; for as tbe pilgrimage of buman life is only an Image of tbe daily and yearly pilgrimage of tbe sun, so tbe dead king, who once ruled over the land, beeomes like a Ita of Amenthes, and every royal tomb an image of Ameutl.es itself. The largest part of all the representations is occupied by the D .. crip-Ii ... of Lif. in *-i.e. 'fua-t, or the depth of the grave. TI.e centre of this life is Ra tbe blessed, who is here always called Afu-Ra, i .Ł. the body of Ra, in opposition to his soul which dwells not in 'fua-tJ but in heaven. He passes by in a boat, always accompanied by Sa and Hekau. Sometimes be is followed by otber gods; he stands in a pavilion, round wbicb a serpent coils. The gods of 'fua-t draw his boat. By the side of this we are generally shown these deities worsbipping him, and also Tum piercing with a lance the serpent which resists his boat. The serpent may be either good or" evil. In No.8, Room V, the UNCUS-serpent and the serpent of life are instances of good serpents. Those tbat place themselves before "the boat are evil. They are called by various names: Nehebka, etc. Sometimes they are rearing up in combat, sometimes lying slothfully coiled up, and times they appear with legs and wings, and fire. The serpent. at the doors apparently only held the post of Boab, or doorkeepers. Besides these we find mentioned" a large number of other beings nected with Tua-t. As to the Nati.n. represented in Nos. 11 and 17, it need only be said that all are humbling themselves before Ra, aCter all his enemies have been conquered by Tum. An active life prevails in Tua·t; there is driving, singing, fighting, reaping, etc. It should be noticed tbat the same representations of Ra are found in many of the papyrus-rolls. The God. of tile Dead by whom the deceased are introduced in"to this world are almost all represented here. Host often it is the jackal-headed Anubis that i. invoked as god of the ·dead by Isis and Nepbthys in favour of the deceased. The infernal Hathor or Hersekhet also often appears. The worahip oC Osiris gives way to that of the blessed Ra, but still the king is represented as adoring him, usually over tbe door of the hall of the sarcophagus. Thoth and the Hoon only oceaaionally appear. Before the "Kin" can ent,\r his last resting-place in peace, he must first be justified; and referring to this the chapter of the Book of the Dead is us)1ally found in the square room in Cront of the hall, as in No.9, VIII, and No.2, IV. In No.6 it is found on the left of the entrance. The Pri ŁŁ I111 C .. ·emoni.. connected with tbe king's ef8gy, in which apparently his son took part, are most perfect in No. 14, less well served in No. 17, and most abridged in No. 11, in the passage leading down from the first hall of pillars. The whole represents the Fa/·tu .... of Ille Dead. After Aru-Ra and with him the king have overcome the obstacles or evil, and he has fied himself from all his sin', he enters into the Host Holy Place, the Empyrean, the highest heaven 
or abode of the blessed, where the visible world of Ammon-Ra appears to touch the Tua-t of the blessed Ita. Here the songs of joy and hymns of praise resound, and Ammon-Ra spreads out his wings like a mighty bird. The gods move past in their barks, the stars rise and set, the hour., the days, the years pass by. The king is placed among the gods, I.e dwells among the star8, and the Divine Comedy is finished.

THEBES. 21. Route. 221 have been connected with the shaft of Dar el-bal}ri, in which the royal mummies were discovered. 21. From Bibb el-Mul1lk to el-Asaatf and DAr el-bahri. From Bab el-Muldk we need not return by the way we came, but may take the path over the hill which separates the Tombs of the Kings from Der el-bal}ri and el-Asastf. The path, which cannot be missed, begins at tomb 16 j from tomb 17 which everyone will visit, it is reached by going a few steps to the west. Persons not equal to the climb may ride to the top, but it is a great strain upon the donkeys. Riding down the hill is by no means to be mended. The donkey-boys usually lead the animals by a narrow path over the ridge, and await tho travellers at the foot. The zigzag path is fatiguing but safe, and is easily accomplished in 3/, hr. The Ł View is most remarkable; first into the desolate valley of the Tombs olthe Kings, then from the summit and as we descend into the culiar ravine of Der el-bal}rij we see the steep projecting mountain side with its tombs, and buildings old and new, with the rich green of the fertile plain below spread out on both sides of the Nile, and here and there its groups of palms and gigantic .temples, as far as Karnak and Luxor on the E. bank. Those who are interested in the prehistoric stone-age, and the flint implements of the childhood of the world, may notice at the beginning of the path as well as on the top of the hill, and as they descend to Dar el-batu-i, several open spaces covered with fragments of flint. Lenormant and Hamy considered these to be prehistoric knife-manufactories, and the myriads of fragments lying about to be the work of man; but Lepsius has proved that they are nothing more than the fragments of flint nodules such as may now be seen lying about, which split owing to the rapid changes of temllerature. The traveller will in fact lind thousands of fragments resembling knives and scrapers. And this is only natural, for whether the splitting ii due to nature or to art, the same shapes are likely to be constantly produced. The calcareous limestone of these hills is full of crystals of silex. The walls of tbe tombs may be remembered with the dark broken nodules which stand out against the light-coloured stone. What Hamy and Lenormant took for flint manufactories at the entrance of Biban el-Kuluk are only heaps of stone, cut out of the rock with metal tools at the making of the tomb. The fragments of limestone and flint were necessarily removed from the excavations and were thrown down on the sides of the valley. On the other hand Virchow assumes a prehistoric Egyptian stone period, and considers the stone-fragments tif Der e1-bal;lri to be to some extent artificial productions. Before turning to the temple of Der el-bal}ri which is seen, with the tower of clay-bricks, as we descend the hill, a visit should be paid to the Necropolis lying between Shekh 'Abd el-l5urnah (p.190) and Drah Abu'l-Neggah (p. 199) known as -HI-Asult. The part to be visited is known by the Arabs as et-4aaatf or the northern Asast!.

222 Route 21. THEBES. a few tombs at el-Aaastf are 1I81l&lly visited by the ordinary traveller. Some belong to the 18th and 19th Dyn., but the most important are of the 26th. Broken walls seem to indicate that the cemetery was divided into sections. We also find here various brick ings and a large arched doorway. During Mariette's excavations many mummies were found, not in regular tombs, but either in the earth itself, or in small vaults S to 6 ft. below the surface. In some of them, papyrus-rolls of great value were discovered. The tomb of· Petameuap =. is larger than Nos. 14 and 17 at Bibln el-MulUk, and is worth a visit on account of its great size. Petamenap was a prince of the empire and an official of the 26th Dyn., whose remarkable position entitled him to the unusual honour of completing buildings at the temple of Medinet-Habu, and of placing his name upon them. The tomb is cut out of remarkably beautiful limestone j and its inscriptions display the neatness of finish which is peculiar to the sculptures of the Egyptian sance. It has become the home of thousands of bats, which render the attempt to copy the inscriptions in the inner rooms very diMcult by constantly extinguishing the light. The smell, moreover, which they cause is so strong and offensive that a thorough inspection of the tomb is recommended ouly to those who can overcome the ing of nausea. Anyone who is subject to giddiness should avoid going far into the tomb, as in the middle it is necessary to balance oneself, though ouly for a few steps, along a narrow path on the edge of a deep shaft. Sir Gardner Wilkinson undertook the ment of the tomb, and the inscriptions have been almost completely copied and partly published by Diimichen. These are important chiefiy for the details of the funeral ceremonies. The entrance, as In almost all the tombs In this part of the polis, is by an open courtyard without walls, 103 ft. wide and 76 ft. deep, whicn leads to a hall In the rock (the mortuary chapel), with chambers and passages. This is 67 ft. wide by 63 ft. deep, and its roof is supported by two rows of pillars. All the walls are ornamented with inscriptions and reliefs carefully executed, but now unfortunately much iJijured and blackened. Tbeset almost without exception, refer to the fate of the soul in the lower worlel. -A vaulted Corridor leads into a second large Room (63 ft. by 87 ft.) in which 8 pillars remain to prevent the roof from falling, wbile in the Boom adjoining it, m'/o ft. square, only 4. have been spared. A Chamber with niches (21 ft. by 12 ft.) conclUeles this series of rooms, the total length of which together with the courtyard is 912 ft. The nature of the stone having apparently prevented further advauce into the rock in this direction, the masons turaed to the left and dUI out a wide HAil, and also to the right, where six successive PtluIl9U were made at right angles leading to a small room.

In fact the 8arcophaglJ. of the deceased lies helow the centre of this block, and is reached by means of a per· pendicular shaft, 18 ft. in depth, at the end of a Corrltlo,' to the righ I of Ibe main passage. By descending the ahaft, a room 19'/2 ft. deep is reached, and from the roof of this Ihere is an enlrance 10 the sarcophagus-halI, which is exactly beneath the square block above described. The lenglh of this privale tomb without the side-chambers is 862 fl., and its IIcial area 2470 sq. yds. or with the shaft-chambers 2660 sq. yds. To the N. ot' this huge tomb are several smaller ones of the same period, with finely worked antechambers, and false doors, and carefully executed inscriptions. Some of these, especially those ot the royal ladies and priestesses of Ammon, Shep-en-tipt and Neit-akat or Nitocf"i8 J, contain valuable butions to the knowledge of the family of Pharaohs which formed the 26th Dynasty. A queen Nitocris of the 6th Dyn., known as a pyramid-builder, is said to have been beautiful and light-haired. With her may have been confounded the princess of the 26th Dyn. with the same name, who was buried at el-Asasil, and lived shortly before the famous courtezan of Naueratis, named Rhodopj. or the rosy-cheeked. Nitocris the elder and Rhodopis were probably called by the same name, i.e. the fair one, in the mouths of the Egyptians, and Herodotus hearing that the 'Falr one' had lived shortly before Amasis, confused the two, and reported that the courtezan Rhodopis was considered the builder of pyramids. See Vol. I., p. 346. The Terrace-Temple of Dar el-ba\J.ri. This temple derives its name, meaning the North Chuf"ch or North Mona.te"" from an ecclesiastical brick building of the ian period, the remains of which are mentioned on p.227. Dar el-ba\1ri is reached from el-Asasif in 10minutes. Its situation is remarkably fine, its terraces which we ascend, being framed by a semicircle of high and rugged rocks, of a light brown and golden colour. If Thebes had been in Greece, this is where its citizens would haTe placed their theatre. The Egyptians whose thoughts were fuller of death than of life, founded a sanctuary for the worship of the dead. Apparently an avenue of sphinxes, of which some traces remain, connected this with the landing-stage, where boats coming from Karnak 011 the W. bank were anchored. This magnificent work was carried out during the rise of the New pire, and the numerous processions of pilgrims began in the 16th cent. B.C. The laying out of the terraces was begun by mes I., and completed by his daughter, Queen Hatshepsu, or tasu-Ramaka, familiar to us as the raiser of the great obelisk of Karnak (p. 133). Here too her brothers, Tutmes II. and IlL, although their names are mentioned, ran into the background when comp&red with their energetic and ambitious sister. DigitIZed by Coogle

Both the style, and the inscriptions tell us that Der ba1}.rils to be considered completely a work of the beginning of the New Empire. The size and simplicity of its parts, and especially the polygonal columns are a sign to those who are familiar with the development of Egyptian architecture, that the Hyksos period must be considered to have been a time of stagnation in Egyptian art, and that exactly the same forms and arrangements of columns were common to the architects of the 12th and to those of the 18th Dynasties. In Thebes, and not least at D6r el-ba1}.ri, the server is tempted to regard the New Empire as an immediate tinuation of the Old, although between them lies a period of Ive hundred years. The plan of this terrace-temple is remarkable, and cannot be compared with any other in Egypt. The arrangement in four terraces rising from the level ground up the steep side of the byan mountains is quite unique. The stages were cut out of the E. slope of the mountain, and support was given to the outer and inner walls by means of blocks of the Inest sandstone. At the S. eud of the terraces we can best see the care taken to support the earth-works. The outer wall consists here of Inely polished bloeks of limestone with simple but effective ornamentation. Broad pi": lasters, but only 3 in. deep, placed some distance apart, project from the wall with which they are connected. Above each is enthroned a gigantic hawk with the crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, standing upon an Urmus-serpent, and above it is the symbol of life supported by an Urmus-serpent. A long Avenue of 8phiflrl:t.t, probably beginning with a pylon, near the entrance to the tomb of Petamenap (p. 222) led up to the series of terraces, the successive stages being reached by steps placed in the middle. The First Terrace (beginning from below) is almost entirely destroyed, but we can make out the pathway which led from the bottom to the top, and divided the whole into two equal parts. low the &cofla (Mariette's TefTtU8e ae t' JUt) are the ruins of a Hall, supported by columns of 16 sides, which in this form were used only under the 17th and 19th Dynasties.

The upright broken shafts should also be noticed; one half was treated as a pillar, the other as a polygonal column with 7 sides, and an inscription was placed on the surface of the pillar. The -Third Terrace (Mariette's Terrasse du Centre) deserves especial notice. Underneath there were on each side, left and right, two rows of 11 square pillars which together formed two halls, 88 ft. long, open to the east. Of these the pillars of the left hall still stand, only two remaining in that on the right. These halls ported a roof, of which all that remains is a fragment of the trave and a broad slab on the 11 pillars in the back row. The scenes represented on the inner wall and on the left side are of great interest. Disregarding for the present the part of the temple to the left( Speos Of Hathor, p. 227) we begin with the right side of the inner wall below the third terrace. The first scenes are somewhat damaged, but those which follow are in a good state of preservation, and refer chiefly to the expedition on which Queen Hatasu-Ramaka sent her ships to Arabia 7 punt) 1. Ramaka represented as king, with the double crown on her head, and the staff in her hand, before Ammon-Ra. There is a long but obliterated inscription. 2.

Next we see 7 Neha-trees in tubs, probably incense-bearing trees imported to Egypt from the East; men with tubs are piling up the incense in heaps. Above are the weighing and measuring ofpreeious metals, &8 may be seen elsewhere. The weights used fur weighing the gold rings are in the form of oxen lying down.

Weal Bank: below, is an· inscription of 13 lines, of which the 8th and 9th were destroyed by Ramses II., for the purpose of inserting his own name in honour of Ammon-Ra, the lord of heaven, etc. It speaks of 'the voyage on the sea, the beginning of the great journey to 1= TG Met', i.e. the holy land, the happy arrival in Arabia of the soldiers of Pharaoh, the lord of the world, according to the command Gf Ammon, the lord of the gods', etc. -Another scription between the trees, to which the boat is fastened, tells us that Punt as well as Arabia Petrala was dedicated to the goddess Hathor. To the left of the two ships are 10 lines describing by name the different kinds of wares which sailors are carrying on board along narrow planks. 'Loading of the ships with untold quantity of valuables from Arabia, precious kinds of wood from the holy land, heaps of the grains of incense-gum (kemi-ent-anta)t, Nehut trees of fresh incense-grains (inta), ebony (hebni) for sacred vessels with gold and silver from of the land Amu (Asia), Deastt, and wood, possibly cassia-bark, grains of Ahemttt, incense and metics (antimony), Anau and Kefu apes, Desem beasts or hounds, coloured panther-skins from the south, natives and children'. The inscription concludes with the statement that nothing like it had been done under any king before, and it speaks the truth. Hatasu showed her people the way to the land whose products were later to ftll the treasuries not only of the Paraohs, but also of the niclans and the Jews. -These pictures are of special Interest as exactly illustrating I Kings x. 22: 'Once in three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks·.

Unfortunately this piece of wall has been stroyed by tourists, and only a small fragment showing the princess and her husband is preserved in the museum at Gizeh. The repreaentation ends with a settlement of the Inhabltanls of Punt. It lies close to the water which is Jlnpulated by flshl turtles, and crayfish, and it would seem as if the inhabItants wolt-e lake-awellers. At all events their conical houses reat upon piles. The door could only be reached by a ladder, which the artist has not forgotten to represent. Palms and cense-trees give shade to the village. In Ws southern landscape appear, Or rather used to appear, on the right a cow reclining, and on the left a tailed bird tlying through the air. The third terrace was formed by the roof of this hall, on the inner wall of which were 
the above-described paintings, together with a Temple, placed in the centre and supported by round columns and by the ground behind. From this terrace a well-preserved granite doorway leads to the burial chambers lying behind (see below). At the end of this terrace to the left there is a remarkable small Sanctuary dedicated to the goddess Hathor, and built by Hatasu and her husband-brother Tutmes II., which should not be left unvisited. The two outer rooms are in ruins, so that even the partition-walls betweeen the halls lying one behind the other are scarcely able. Some of the pillars and bases of the columns, however, are still upright. We turn to the right and :dnd the remains of a Hat/lOr Cow. There are also some more paintings of ships, but very faint. On the outer wall of the temple built into the mountain, is an ox licking the hand of king, i.e. queen Ramaka. As the adjoining text says, 'She licks Horus to whom she gave birth'. To the right of the door is Tutmes III. (Ra-men-kbeper-ka), and within mes II. who built the door and gave his name to it. The Burial Chambers lying behind are reached through an chamber with two small niches on each side. This is succeeded by another long room with a :dat blue ceiling, ornamented with red stars at one time probably gilt. On each side of this funeral chamber are niches. Next is a narrow room with two niches. At the back of this last on the two side-walls above the shaft is an exceedingly interesting -Representation of Queen Hatasu, drinking the milk of life from the udders of the Hathor Cow. The cow is the :dnest piece of animal painting which has come down to us from Egyptian tiquity. The cartouche of the queen was erased, probably by order of her indignant ward Tutmes III. when he became independent. All the inscriptions and paintings in this room (cynocephali, lions, etc.) are perfect in style; those in the niches tell us that these were used for the storing of offerings. The last or Fourth Terrace is badly preserved. We first come to a granite doorway built by Tutmes m. on the central path, on the left hand side of which we see an inscription of the 3rd year of Merenptah I.

inscriptions recording that this, which must have existed even under the old monarchy, was adorned under the 18th Dyn. with fine buildings for the deity of the city. Strabo relates that Zeus and Apollo were worshipped and that a sacred bull was kept here. As a matter of fact the ments, besides mentioning several female deities, name Month (Zeus) and seven forms of Horus (Apollo) as the chief gods at monthis, while the coins of the Nomos Hermonthites bear the figure of a bull turned towards the right, and preparing to fight, with lowered horns and extended tail. The Pharaoh is described as ing upon his foes, like 'Month, the bull raising himself to combat'. -At Risagllt, 41/2 M. to the S.W. of Erment, a stele of the 18th Dyn. was found, in which this place is named Aimatiru. On the right bank, facing the curve which the Nile describes at the village of Senlld, lies the village of Ttld, the ancient Tuphium, with a minoas chamber, the sole relic of a small temple of the Ptolemies. Maspero recently discovered here a granite sacriftcial table, with a dedication by Usertesen I. to the god Month. Steles of the 12th and 13th Dyn. (now at Gizeh) were found at Balamfyth, 18/, M. to the W. of Tftd. -At MtaMh, on the E. bank, are ments of a sphinx with the name of Amenhotep I. On the W. bank, 13 M. above Erment, and opposite a large land, rise two rocky heights, known as Gebel6n, i.e. the 'two tains', on one of which is the tomb of a Bh2lch MtlIah, probably confounded with Moses (see above). Here, on the site ofthe ancient . G Anti, probably once stood the ancient NWWI \\ l1li polis, which, according to Strabo, must be looked for between montbis (Erment) and Latopolis (Esneh). Extensive excavations carried on at this spot by Maspero yielded sarcophagi of the 12th Dyn. and also numerous domestic articles, etc., appropriate to sons of comparative poverty. On the W. bank, 131/2 M. farther up, lies Blueh, the ancient Latopolil, a town of 9000 inhab., where the tourist-steamers halt for 3 hrs., while the mail-steamer on the downward voyage stops all night. The profane name of this place under the Pharaohs was -00 Sen, whence came the Coptic CItH (Snt) and the Arabic Esneh. Esneh has large grain and cattle markets, at which prices are lower than at Assuan. The town, in which there are numerous colree-houses and ghawazi, is somewhat notorious for the dissolute disposition of the otherwise industrious inhabitants, many of whom are employed in wool-weaving.

The remarkable "*Rypolltyle of Elneh is built throughout of excellent sandstone, and remains in perfect preservation with the exception of the lower part of the rear wall, which has been what corroded by the saline exudations of the soil. The noble hall is kept clean by government. The roof is borne by U columns (in 6 rows), the first six of which are connected by balustrades; and a dim light penetrates to the remotest corner of the hall between the columns.

Upon the somewhat lofty abaci of the columns rests a ma86in architrave, which supports roofing-slabs, 22-26 ft. long and wide. It bs been calculated that about 110,000 cubic feet of sandstone have been used for this one haIl alone.

Though these last fan short of the dignity of style which claims admiration in the earlier works of Egyptian art, yet they display that remarkable care in the representation of details and that elaborate variety of form which at once distinguishes the inscriptions of the time of the Ptolemies and of the Romans, and renders their interpretation more difficult.

The former show the king making oJrerings to various divinities of the temple, who promise him in return the good things of life. At the foot of the wall to the right of the entrance is the emperor Commodus with Arneris and Khnum capturing with a net the various products of the Nile (birds, fishes, plants, etc.). On the other side of the net Is Safekh. This symbolical representation sibly refers to the legend according to which Horns fighting against Seth-Typhon fell dead into the water and was drawn out of it again living, -a 
legend, which is connected with the course of the moon. A main door and two side portus are seen in the wall of the temple. The latter probably gave admittance to a dor sunounding the Sanctuary, which was entered by the central portal. Recent excavations in this direction have hitherto remained without result. On the pieces of wall between the pillars on the Front are eral highly important inscriptions, of which by far the most valuable is the celebrated Calendar of Fe,Uvau on the wall-pUlars to the right and left. A specimen of the eccentricities and treaks indulged in by the hierograinmatists under the Romans, may be seen in the crowd of crocodiles on the pillar at the extreme left of the E. or entrance wall. The 24 Column. of the port.ico are specially noteworthy on count of the shapes of their capitals, some of which are overladen with ornament. Of the columns, 18 stand detached, while 6, wards the front, are built into the outer wall. All the columns have :t1at plinths, and shafts most elaborately adorned with inscriptions. The Capital. are of various shapes and of unequu height, but this irregularity does not offend the eye owing to the fact that the annuli of all the columns are arranged so as to lie in the same horizontal plane.

The various monuments may be visited in the above order as follows. We skirt the boundary wall of the ancient town, which is distinctly visible, then tum to the E. to (3/, hr.) an isolated hill, rising from the plain, on the right side of which are most of the rock-inscriptions. At the end of this valley we tum a little to the left to reach the chapel of Amenhotep Ill., with four columns in the interior. We here turn round, and follOwing the S. wall of the more northerly chain of hills, reach the steps which lead to the rock-temple. We may then visit the small temple of Thoth (called by the Arabs 'the bath'), or proceed to the tombs, about 1 M. from the river. The now vanished town of Hebem was called by the Greeks Eiteitl.yia or Leucothea (Pliny), and in the inscriptions the FOf'trell Hebent + j, often with the surname of I 'the wlaite town'. The interpretation of the name of the city and its goddess as Nelelleb and Suben is probably wrong. The *GIlWLB WALL is in excellent preservation, and encloses a square the sides of which are 700 ydll. long, with a total circumference of 2800 yds. The wall itself is of immense thickness, 37 ft. or as wide as a considerable street, and is built of huge sun-dried Nile-bricks. The savants of the French Expedition estimated that the ancient town accommodated 10,000 iuhabitants. Visitors should not omit to mount the broad &IIcant to the top of the wall on the W. side, from which a good survey of the tombs on the N. hill-chain is also obtained.

The sanctuary, which stood within the wall, was dedicl\ted to Sebek and Hebent and existed even under the 18th Dynasty. ChampoIlion saw here the cartouches of Tutmes II., Ramaka, Amenhotep III., two scenes in whirh Bamses II. did homage to Sebek and Hebent, and Hakoris and Nectanebus I. from later times. The town itself was founded at a much earlier date, and in fact is, as we shall see, one of the very oldest in Egypt. It existed even under the ancient empire. During the period of the Hyksos it was scarcely less conspicuously than Thebes the residence of the legitimate Pharaohs who had been driven towards the S. The most important monuments for the history of the freeing of Egypt from the foreign domination are to be found here. RoOK INSCRIPTIONS. -The route leads due E. from the E. way in the girdle-wall, and crosses the dazzingly white sand, past a small ruined Temple close to the wall. In rather more than if2 hr. we reach the small temple of Thoth, known to the Arabs as Qammlim (p. 2(9). We keep straight on, leaving the larger temple of the Ptolemies on the left, and soon reach two Rocks projecting from the plaic, at the point where the road turns N. towards the desert, halfway between el-I;lammam and the E. temple of hotep III. Both rocks bear numerous inscriptions, most of which use the hieratic contractions. The royal names of Pepi and Teta refer these to the 6th Dynasty. The inscriptions are chiefty names of priests and their sons, who probably selected this spot for the consummation of the sacrifices to the after-world. At all events there are but few representations of offerings to the local goddess 4-0 j Hebent-Eileithyia. There are also Bome brief prayers. On the S.W. side of the larger rock is a very interesting Figuf'1I of an cient King, with bare head, above which hovers the disc with the Urmus-serpent. The small temple or CHURL opAMlINHOTBP III. lies fully 1/. hr. to the E. It may be reached direct in about an hour from the Nile, though the shadeless route, especially at inidday, is somewhat guing. The little temple which is nearly 50 ft. deep is of able interest from the artistic forms which it displays. The small Cella (221/3 by 19 ft.) stands upon a paved platform, which was at one time surrounded by a wall of freestone. The gateway still stands, and was formerly connected with the sanctuary proper by a passage, at the sides of which stood smooth columns with capitals.

They are reached in about 1/. hr. from the usual landing-place of the Nile boats j and the last few minutes' climb up the hill-slope on which the tombs lie, must be accomplished on foot.

These 2'omb., hewn side by side in the rock, are, like all the ments at el-Kilb, of small dimensions, but their distinct pictures of cient Egyptian domestic llfe will interest even those travellers who have already seen the tombs of Benihasan and 'Abd el-Kurnah. One of tbe In.criplion. (in the tomb of Ole ship-captain Aahmes; see p. 241) is of the greatest scientific importance, partly on account of the contemporary narrative of the expulaion of the Rykaos which it contains, partly on account of the simple and intelligible style in which it ia expressed. It has been critically translated and analysed (by E. de Rouge) a. the 11,.., of all Ole larger inscriptions. -Host of the tombs were constructed fore, during, or shorlly after the rule of the Ryksos, for male and female members of noble families, who discharged the peacefnl duties of chief priests of Rebent or of lulors and 'nurses to the royal princes. There are 31 tombs in all, but only 13 have inscriptions and only 6 repay a visit. We 1Irst enter the third inscribed tomb, counting from the E., which is by its wide opening. This belonged to the overseer (--D)' of el-K&b, the scribe (i.e. savant) PiIIan \\ grandson (daughter's son) of the ship-master Aahmes, son ofAbna, whose tomb lies farther to the left (W.).

Those, with the exception, of course; Of Aahllles, were probably provincial or local kings. Above some ships in the left part of the tomb a festival of Ramses Ill. is mentioned, probably a later addition. According to Maspero this tomb dates from the 20th Dynasty. Farther to the left lies the tomb of Aahmes, Chief of the Bailors, the son of Abna and her husband Baba, who was the maternal grandfather of Pihari. The Funereat Inscription is carved in the rock instead of being painted on stucco, a fact which lends great importance to this tomb. TIle inscription covers nearly the whole wall to the right, as we enter, sharing it with the dgure of the deceased. Aahmes appears with Aipv his wife, seated in a chair beneath which cowers a pet monkey; before them stand their daughter's son Plharl, who caused this tomb to be adorned for his gallant gl'&lldfather. Beneath is another Pihar, offering sacrifice to his father Haran and his wife, and beneath him again are three sons, Including yet another Rlaar. Beside the door to the chamber is another dedication to Aahmes, the chief of the sailors, from his grandson Pihari (p. 289), to keep his memory green in tbis spot. The biography of Aahmes thus begins: 'Aabmes (Amasls), commander of the sailors, son of the late Abna, speaks: I speak to you, all ye people. I.oarn the marks of honour which fell to my share; for I was distinguished seven times with the golden necklace, in the presence of the whole try. ŁŁ lIIale and female slaves were my own (the names of the slaves presented to Aabmes are inscribed on the outside of the tomb), and I received many delds. The name of a great hero which he (the speaker) won for himself, will nevermore be obscured In tbis land. He speaks: I was born in the town of Hebent (Eileithyla); my father was a colonel under the late king Rasekenen (Vol. I., p.89), and was named Baba, son of Roan; then I served in his stead as captain on board the ship 'The Young Ox', in the reign of Ra-neb-pehti (i .Ł. Aahmes I.). I was young and unmarried and slept on tbe couch of the Khennu (perhaps those cluded from the dwelling of the married, i .Ł. bachelors). But after I had founded a household (taken a wife), I betook myself to fight in the N. deet. Then I fOllowed the king on foot, when he mounted his chariot. When the fortress of Ha-war (Abaris, a stronghold of the Hykeos, Vol. I., p. 89) was besieged, I had to dght on foot before the king. Then I was appOinted to the ship 'Xha em Mennefer' (Ascent in lIIemphls); we fought lD the arm of the river at Abaris and I acquired booty and won a hand (of a slaughtered enemy). This was reportea to the officer of the king, and I received the golden necklace for valour. Another contest took place on the same spot and I was again awarded the golden necklace for valour'. Aahmes was decorated a third time at Takemi, to the S. of the fortress. 'Abarls was taken and I captured there in all 4 persons, a man and a women I His lIIajesty asslgued them to me as slaves'. -The next lines inform us that after the king had captured the fortress of the sos and overcome the nomadic tribes, he carried on war with the tribes of the S., in which Aahmes took part and won fresh laurels. He served also under Amenhotep I. and Tutmes I. Under the last-named prince the Egyptian army penetrated far Into Asia. The inscription goes on: upon his majesty set out for Syria (Ruten), in order to reduce the peoples to his good pleasure. He reached lIesopotamia (Nabarina). His lIajesty, the living, sound, and atrong one, met this wretched one (the 
prince of l1Iesopotamia), and undertook the attack. The king terrible chery among them I and the prisoners taken alive by His lllaiesty were innumerable.

I shaU rest in the vault, which I have prepared for myself'. The tomb of RenRi, still farther to the left (W.), contains numerous representations of interest. The deceased, a son of a lady named Aahmes and father of another Aahmes, was a prince (erpa hal and a large landed proprietor. Two obelisks seem to have stood at the entrance to this vault j and the statue of the deceased is to be seen in its recess. The roof of the chapel is vaulted, and covered like the waUs with a thin coat of stucco, on which the representations and Inscriptions were painted. On the right wall .re the funeral of Renni and other seenes connected with his death, while on the left wall are scenes from the life of the deceased, who accompanied by his dog, surveys his p088esaions. Here appear his carriage, his serfa busied in tilling the ground, and his family in friendly union. Beside each of the persons waited on by the aervan ts of the deceased appears his name and his relationship _ to the head of the family. Among the livestock belonging to Renni 11iOO swine are mentioned, a ciroumstance which appears somewhat surprising at first, for the fiesh of swine was an arlieIe of diet as strictly forbidden to the Egyplians as to the Jews. Renni, however, was a prophet of Hebent, and had to provide swine to be sacriflced to this goddess, which accounts for his posse88ion of the otherwise abhorred animals. This markable circumstance did not escape the notice of Herodotus, who writes: 'They sacrillce swine to no gods except Selene (goddess of the. moon, Ł.Ł. Hebent) and Dionysus; making this sacrifice to the moon ways at full moon! at which time they also eat swine's fiesh. tians assign a particular reason for abhorring swine at other festivals and oWering them at this one, but although I know it I am not permitted to reveal It'. Herodotus was bound by an oath not to reveal the myatery, from which, however, we may be able to lift the veil by a study of the monuments. It Is related that Typhon (Seth), while hunting by moonlight, feU in with the coffin of Oalris, and hewed the corpse into 14 parts, Ł.Ł. the 14. n'ghts of the waxing and waning moon. ThIs orb is called the left eye of Horus, and, as the Inscriptions explainJ it was in jeopardy on the 10th night, i.'. the time of the full moon. it had been observed that eclipses of the moon aWected the light only of the full moon, and thus arose the myth that Seth Typhon, In the form of a swine, attaeks the orb of night 
at the full moon and endeavours to swallow it. The desire of io,iuring the enemy of the moon and of assisting the latter In her contest against the animal that seeks to devour her, Onds symbolical expression in the slaughter of swine at the time of the new moon. Kany other Egyptian customs are also to be explained by reference to the conte.t betwixt Horus and Seth. The last three tombs farther to the left (W.) appear to date from the 13th Dyn., and are therefore much more ancient than those just described, uuless we regard the 14-17th Dyn. as ruling in Upper Egypt contemporaneously with the Hyksos in Lower Egypt. The first was erected to a lady named 8ebeknefru, by her father Beba, who possibly himself is .buried here too. Sebeknefru was "+ Q 0 8uten am, i.e. belonging to the king's court.

This alone can II1plain how the temple is now at a much lower level than the surrounding village. The building presented a very dlfl'erent appearance only thirty years ago. Arab houses stood upon the temple itself and were built againat its walls. The Interior was filled with rubbish almost up to the capitals of the columns, and the outside was equally deeply buried.

In the beginning of the sixties, however, the entire temple was laid bare by Bariette under the auspices of the Khedive, and the buildings clustering upon and around it were removed. Now the temple of Edfu is seen in wonderful, almost perfect preservation, exceeding that of any other Egyptian temple or even of any antique building in the world, In spite of the a,OO years that have passed over It. From top to bottom It Is covered with tations and remarkable. inscriptions, the interpretation of which was reserved for the present century, so rich in-discoveries of every kind. The **Temple of Edfu is superior to the temple at Denderah in the much greater distinctness of its sculptured reliefs and tions, due probably to the use of better sandstone than that of Denderah which contains more lime. It is also much more complete, for in addition to chambers corresponding to those found at derah, there are at Edfu a passage running round the temple and a lofty wall enclosing the latter, besides a spacious fore-court. and two massive pylons.

An scription relating to the Horus myth, on the inside of the W. girdle-wall, states that 'they reached Seth-Typhon and his panions in the nome of Apollinopolis'. Horus emerged victorious from this battle, and the evil Typhon was pierced by him (tebu). 'Piercer thereupon became his name, and 'place of the piercing' the name of his district and town. This name is clearly preserved in the modern name Edru. other name, that occurs most frequently next to this one and has also reference to the chief deity of the temple at Edeu, is Hut or Behut. Thus the winged sun-disc, which was placed over the trance to every Egyptian temple, was named ::= n ·Op r Behut nuter i neb pe.t ib BU.ti per em khu.t 'Hut, the great god, the lord of heaven, who, clad in bright age, comes forth from the sun-mountain'. Another name for the winged sun-disc is Api, which means 'fiying' and 'wings'. At the head of the gods worshipped at EMu stood, as is rent from what has alrea'ly been said, 'Horus, who spreads his wings, the great god, the lord of heaven, who, clad in bright age, comes forth out of the &un-mountaiu'. Next to him rank the HalhoT of Denderah, who undertook a special festal journey to Edfu, Ahi, son of Hathor, OsiriS, 18is, Nephthy8, Shu, aud Terllut. History of the Temple. The representations and inscriptions that cover the walls of the great temple of Horus at Edfu place it beyond doubt that the building in its form dates from the period of the Ptolemies. Yet like the sanctuary of Hathor at derah, it is not an architectonic creation of that period, but merely a splendid restoration of an earlier temple carried out under the Lagidae. The Temple proper, i.e. the sacred apartments sive of the later hypostyle with its 18 columns (1'1. E) and of the fore-court with its 32 columns (Pl. F), as well a8 of the stillbter pylons and girdle-wall, was begun by Ptolemy III. Euergetes I. in the 10th year of his reign. It was flnished 9j years later, in the 28th year of the reign of Ptolemy IX. Euergetes II., and the 18th ·Mesori in that year was flxed by the priests for its consecration, as an important festival took place upon that day. The image of Horus was. carried in solemn procession into the temple, and the author of the builders' inscriptions at Edeu, in describing this lemn entry, introduces the god as astonished by the magniflcence that greeted him, and moved by joy, as addressing hb ings. In his speech the god expressly states that 'the halls were renewed in their building', and that 'commands went forth from their majesties to rebuild his house, an edUlce of ancient times, and DigitIZed by Coogle

248 Rout' 23 EDFU. Horw-the complete rebuilding of the temple at EMu was accomplished within the period of 180 years, S months, and U days. As a kind of pendant or companion-piece to this tong histol"tcal" inscription of the W. girdle-wall, there appears another no less teresting Inacription at the foot of the E. Girdle Wall (pl. k). This second inscription, which has a total length of 240 ancient Egyptian ells, contains a summary account of the whole temple, followed by a detailed description of each or its rooms. Like all dedicatory scriptions of the kind, it begins with the name of the monarch under whom the monument it refers to (in the present case, the girdle-wall) was completed. The Inscription begins as follows: 'The golden Horus who shows himself In heaven as the wlng-spreading god of EMu, clad in bright plumage, he haa taken possession of his abode ŁŁŁ prepared by Ł.. lemy XI. Alexander 1.' 'This beautiful large wall, behind his temple at the side of his father's building, its length 2W ells, its breadth 90 ells, its height to the summU 20, the thickness of its foundation Ii ells. This monument, which was erected by His MeJesty and his father, is formed like the sun-monntain of heaven.' These dimensions correspond with measurements made by the writer. The length of the girdle-wall to the pylons was found to be '141/. ft., which reckoning the ancient Egyptian ell at 13/. ft., Is equal to 240 ... ells; breadth 1SS3/. ft. = 89 .ŁŁ ells; height SSI/. ft. = 19 .Ł ells; ne88 61/. ft., i.e. not quite' (insteM of S) ells. We may.now bestow a glance on the general arrangement of the temple as a whole. The main axis lies W. and S., as is repeatedly mentioned in the inscriptions referring to this point i it <:::> m r 'from Orion (the S. star) to the Great Bear (the N. ·constellation)'. The early Egyptian architects seem to have been guided by these two constellations in determining the orientation of any new temple, as appears to be indicated with some certainty by inscriptions at Edfu. The laying of the stone of an early Egyptian temple was a ceremony of peculiar nity, in which the king himself, as has been observed in the count of Denderah (p. 86), took part; and even in the case of temples built at a time wben tbe rulers of Egypt had ceased to share personally in these ceremonies (as e.g. under tbe Roman perors who did not live in Egypt at all), tbe inscriptions still times speak in tbe old-fashioned style as tbough the monarch had duly performed bis part. An inscription along tbe foot of the wall in Hall D states tbat 'His Majesty in his proper person, with his band on the wooden peg and bolding the line in bis grasp, along with tbe goddess Safekh, is to be found beside his strument to determine the four corners of tbe temple at Edfu'. This N. and S. axis divides the entire bulldlng into a right and a left (or W. and R.) half, reckoned from Room I (p. 2(2), which occupies the exact centre of the rear-wall of the temple, and is named in the inscriptions 'divider of tbe middle'.

This is usually named > Mallet, i.e. 'portal-building', 'entrance-hall', in the inscriptions, a nation which is not unfrequently employed to include the entire gatehouse and the two towers, though the most usual term for the entire entrance-structure was j:-' M Bekhm, i./I. 'tower', 'watch-tower'. This passage was formerly closed with a massive door with two wings. The entire lofty gatehouse is covered from top t·o bottom and on all sides with reliefs and inscriptions, amongst which, esper.iallyon the right and left, the colossal Figure of the King (Neos Dionysus) is conspicuous, smiting his foes, whom he holds by the hair, in presence of Horns and Hathor. In two rows, above, the king appears praying and offering sacriftces before the gods of Edfu. -Below, on the left CW.) pylon, the king and queen conduct a procession of representatives of the districts that yield gold, silver, other metals, precious stones, cosmetics, etc., and furnish them to the temple. On the front of the pylon towers are four wide incisions, two on each side of the central portal. These were intended to support the huge copper-mounted wooden poles with gilded tips, which are illustrated in Vol. I., p. 168. One of the lower marginal inscriptions states that these poles were intended at Edfu to avert the storms of heaven, and that they were adorned with gay flags at the top. The pitch-dark lower Pylon Chambers on each side are entered from the court by doors to the right and left of the portal, and from each of them an easy Staircase of 24'2 steps in 14 flights ascends to the Platforms of the towers. One of the towers should certainly be ascended, in spite of the numerous steps. The view from the top is unusually attractive, commanding not only the most imposing survey of the temple-buildings, but also ranging over the ing country. The plain through which the Nile flows, with its verdant crops and its villages fringed with palms and mimosas, framed by the desert-mountains in the distance, presents a scene ofsurprising beauty, especially when seen under the evening light that renders the Egyptian landscape so wonderfully distinct. The :rore-Court (PI. F), which is bounded in front by the pylons, at the back by the hypostyle hall (Pl.

Ptolemy X. Soter II. is named in the marginal inscriptions as the builder and finisher of court, in harmony with the great inscription on the W. girdle-wail. The lower marginal Inscription on Wall a of ilie court says of this 'klng: 'He has built the Court of the Appearance of the protecting Horus (usekht khii. en Sa-Hor), the lord of the goda, as a copy of the building of the sun-mountain with the god of the sun-mountain, completed in his building in excellent work in good sandstone; offerings are made to his divine image in it'. An inscription on the oppOSite wall (Pl. b) says of ilie same king, that he built the Court of Offenngs (usekht utent) 'in order to sacrifice to the sun-god thrice a day'. Detailed information is given in the inscriptions as to the size of this fore-court, the height and thickness of its walls, the number and shape of the columns, and the side-doors and main-portal. The length is repeatedly given as 90 Egyptian ells, the breadth as SO, the height of the walls as 20, and their thickness as 6; ments, which taking the ell as 13/4 ft. correspond tolerably closely with measurements made on the spot (length 155 ft., breadth 138 ft., height of wall 341/2 ft., thickness 81/2 ft_). The number of the 'columns, the great ones, erected in it' is correctly given as 32; their beauty and strength is extolled; and the capitals and shafts minutely described. The doors are also described in order, details .being sometimes given as to whether had one or two wings, of what wood they were made, and whether they opened inwards or outwards. Besides the four side-doors of the court and the main portal between the pylons, the two doors leading from the court to the gate-towers are also described, as well as the door l'Pl. d) in the N. haIf of the E. girdle-wall and another smaller door, nearer the N. end of the same wall, leading to the Temple-Well.

252 Route 23. EDFU. Two important a.nd specially instrnctive 1,,,.,.ipli,,," describe the vari01l8 rooms in order in the course of a summary review. One of these forms the lower marginal inscription on the outside of the E. girdle-wall; t the other is ou the outside of the W. wall of the temple proper. tt The inscriptions at Edfu begin their account of the dilferent rooms with Room I., at the centre of the rear-wall of the temple, which they name 'Divider of the Middle' (comp. p. 218). Thence they proceed to the rooms lying to the right and left, and then to the Adytum (PI. A) and the Prosekos rooms in front of it. Those who desire to follow the description in" order begin at Room I. Of this '.'1. it Is said: 'The ment Me ŁŁ ,. (No. I) is in its (the temple's) centre as the chief apartment, with the great throne of the dispenser of rays; the goddess Ma is with him, as Bathor the great, in his shrine, the very secrel place, iu it (i.e. the room), whose breadth is 81/_ ells and its depth 62/.. Ita wall is painted with the cycle of the gods of the true Mesen-chamber, their forms &ccording to their prototyres'. The word Me .. " means here bably dwelling of the helpers 0 Borns. In the second inscription this "room is also named Ha ke", 'chamber of the victor" and it is slated that 'the figure of the" protecting Borus, In his noble shape as a perching hawk, an ell high, with the scourge (is there to be seen). The goddess Ma is before him; she does not separate herself from him, who is ever united with her. As Bathor, the great, she is with him in the shrine within the mysterious cella of dark granite'. Room II. is named 'the right chamber' and the 'west chamber' or 'dedicated to the god of the west' (Osiris); Room Ill, 'the chamber of the great' (Osiris); Room IV, 'the inner-room of the tomb-chamber'. These three are the Rooflll. Room V is called the 'room of the throne of the gods'; Room VI, the 'cloth-chamber'; then on the E. side, Room VII, 'the Sebek-chamber' of the moon-god Khunsu; Room Vll, the sanctuary of Bathor; and Room IX, the 'throne-room of Ra'. Of Room x: we read: 'the Room 01 'h. 8preader of Wi"V' (No. x) contains on its E. wall the divine image of the headed goddess of the north, and of the cycle of gods, that watch over Osiris. There is the god Shu as the representative of the N. wind, inflating his nostrils, as is his wont in the kingdom of eternity (i .Ł. the under-world), and the lion-headed goddess Tefnut, as the representative of devouring fire, in the act of burning his (Osiris s) enemies, as she does it in the place that is the goal of millions (a.nother name for the world). There also are the goddess lIIent, daughter of the sun, with her backward glance, and the great Bekhet-Artemis, the mistress of the desses of vengeance'. The Adglflfll or Holy 01 Holie, (Pl. A) is next described: 'The room of the great throne (i.e. the adytum) in the centre, round which the passage runs, is in ells 192/. + 1/. by 101/.. A door leading into the sage is found on its right and on its left side, in order to re&ch the closed rooms lying round it. The sacred boat of Tesneferu the coloured and his sacred shrine are pl&Ced there; his great cella, of dark granite, it is a wouder to behold it'. This Cella of dark grauite, erected by Kiug Nectauebus, stands to this day in the adytum (p. 246). With reference to the 8lairCQIu the iuscription states that the E. stair was ascended on New Year's Day, in order to unite the god with his soul and that the W .Ł lair was ascended to olfer s&Crifice in the morning. Of the Door. in Hall D the inscription says: 'The door upou U. W. side is for the bringing of refreshing water, a.nd that on its E. side for the bringing of meat-oll'erings'. We now betake ourselves to the passage round the temple proper (Pl. H). Special attention should be bestowed on the inscriptions and reliefs on the Inside of the W.

Do,..." in a ship with expanded sail, aims a blow with his right hand at the head of a hippopotamus, whose hind foot is caught in a line held in the god's left hand. Iii. kneeling in the bow of the boat holds the head of the animal by a cord. The king, standing on the bank with two dants armed with javelin and knife, seeks to pierce the skull of the hippopotamus. ' , On the inside of the N. Girdle-waU (PI. g g) are several long hymns to the god of Edfu. -The traveller is recommended to walk round the outside of the girdle-waU, which is also completely covered with representations and inscriptions. The above-mentioned important inscription relating to the history of the temple is to be seen on the outside of the W. WaU (PI. i), and the description of the various rooms outside the E. WaU (pI. k). The eight Records of Donations of Fields are·also on the E. wall. These inscriptions and the decoration of the entire external face of the girdle-wall date from the reign of Ptolemy XI. Alexander I. (106-87 B.C.). The half-buried Birth Bouae (Nameld), lying to the left of the entrance to the great temple of Borus, is less worthy of a visit. It was built by Ptolemy IX.

It Is about W ft. long, and the front portion Is occupied by a VESTIBULE, about 22 ft. wide, with " columns, of which the Orst pair form the entrance. The representations here are familiar to us from other Egyptian temples. King Ball I. appears before Ammon-Ra, who hands to him the sword of victory. 'He smites the princes of the miserable Kush' (Ethlo;P,la). Beblnd Ammon are 10 names of fettered tribes. Ammon speaks: Receive the sword, Oh lord of the peoples, to smite down the princes of Kush and to cui all theIr heads. Fear of thee penetrates their limbs like Sekhet In her wrath.'

For substructures, however, and for walls surrounded with earth they wisely gave the preference to limestone. -The hills on the two banks of the river approach so close together at Gebel Silsileh that they have justly been compared to the pillars of a lI.igantie gateway. The legend of the chain that once barred the passage of the river here Is probably pure invenllon taking its rise from the Coptic name of the city of quarries, which in ilie hleroglyphles 18 named Po .{Ow .... u. The later Egyptians n,med the town i.e. 'a'" pe" da ... h.""" barrier, probably in reference to the gorge of the river. The Romans, who maintained a garrison here, converted the T'el t'el of the Egyptians into Billil;, which was confounded by the Arabs with the Arable for 'chain'. The people, seeking meanings for every name and preferring those that come in the guise of a legend thereupon Invented the story of a chain, that once barred the gorge at Gebel Silsileh. lly and by the very place where this mythieai chain had been fastened came to be pointed out. The dhahabiyehs generally halt in the very midst of the uments. We tum first to the N., ascend a well-beaten track, and then gradually descend the rocky hilI. On the slope beside the river are some tomb-like Reee8lea, belonging to officials of the 18th Dyn., with the names of Tutmes III. and his sister Hatasu over the entrance. In one of these, the surface of which is divided into squares, some of the figures are sketched but lefi unfinished. Farther on is a cave with a painted ceiling. Beside it are scriptions of the time of Ramses III., builder of Medinet Habu, who is represented before Ammon, Muth, and Khunsu. There is also a larger memorial tablet of the 21st year of Sheshenk I. (22nd Dyn.). Sheshenk had commanded his architect Horemsai to quarry stones at Silsileh for the gateway erected by the king on the S. side of first court of the temple of Ammon at Karnak. Immediately to the N. is a Stele bearing various conventional phrases and dating from Ramses V. (r whose name seldom oceurs on the monuments. Finally we reach the broad of the shallow -otBock Chapel (Speo.), which may be reckoned among the most important monuments in the Nile valley, on account of its reliefs and inscriptions. This chapel, hewn in the rock close to the mit of a hilI, dates from the 18th Dyn. In front are five doorways, separated from each other by pillars at varying distance, and crowned with the astragal and concave cornice. Numerous gods are named in it. Sebek, who forms a triad with Ammon-Ha and Muth, takes the first place; Ptah of Memphis is also mentioned.

The king wears the war-helmet and carries the staff of empire in his lefl hand. Behind and before him are court-officials, warding oW the sun's rays with the long-handled flabellum. The Kherheb precedes the litler, olfering incense, and a train of captured Ethiopians is led along by the victor. Vanquished blacks are lying on the ground and others are being rapidly marched otT by Egyptian soldiers. Above the captives are the words: 'Leading of the captives of the miserable Kush by Horus, king of Upper and Lower Egypt, etc. His majesty came out of the land of Kush (Ethiopia) with the booty which his sword had made, as his father Ammon had manded him'. Before the priests, who stand in a reverential attitude, is writlen: 'The good god approaches, he celebrates his victory over the great ones of all lands. When he grasps the bow in his right hand he is like the lord of Thebes (i.e. Honth, the god of war), as king of the strength of heroes. Above the prisoners is the inscri.ption: 'Hail to thee, king of Egypt, sun of the barbarians! Thy name 18 extolled in the land of the EthIOpians. Thy battle-cry resounds over their seats. Thy heroic strength, o thou perfect prince, converts the alien lands into tombs. Pharaoh, long life and health, 0 my sun-god' (Shu).

The chambers belonged to officials of 'futmesIlI., whose name occurs over the entrance along with those of Ammon Harmachis and Sebek. The first cave belonged to ]{hem nekht, overseer of granaries, who is here represented along with his wife.

A.a kheperuj with two small Stelu in bad preservation on the left, and two others, better preserved, on the right. Fartl1er to the S. near the river is a brightly painted ClWe, with painted ceiling. A relief here depicts Amonemhat, a high priest of Ammon (probably, from his name, under the 12th Dyn.) sacrificing to his parents and those of his wife Mimi. The guides pOint out large square holes in the lofty rooks as having been used to fasten the above-mentioned mythioal chain of Silsileh. Skirting the bushy river-bank we presently reach three Inscribed Tablets, offering a picturesque appearance as seen from the Nile. Two of them, adorned with concave cornices and with doors, lie close beside each other. The architrave is borne by tured bud-columns, the shafts of which represented stems of plants bound together by a band. Both of these brightly painted act as frames for large Steles, placed at the back of small chapels about 6 ft. deep. That to the S. (left) was erected by Ramse!

At the top is the triad to which it was dedicated, -next is a Hymn to the Nile, and below is a list of sacrifices. In the one case the divine triad consists of Ammon, Muth, and Khunsu, the chief triad of Upper Egypt. in the other ofRa Harmachis, Ptah, and Hapi, ing Lower Egypt. A third, similar Steet, dating from the 6th year of Ramse. III., is to be seen on an isolated rock to the right.

Long may he live, possessing firmness and might, eternally. Long live the beneficent god, the Nile that lovea the prim"'val waters (Nun), the father of the gods, who form the eycle of the nine deities, which belong to the flooda, the blessing, the abundance, the support of Egypt, who blesses all the world with life by his rich abundance, who is dignified in his course and distributes blessings with his fingers. The elect are rejoiced at his approach. Thou art one that hast created thyself, and nO man knows whence thou art. On the day that thou comest out of thy roundings, all the world rejoices. Tbou art a lord of many fishes and gifts, who bestowest nourishment upon Egypt. Even the nine deities know not whence thou art. Thou art their life. Therefore when thou approachest they redouble their olferings; they furnish the altars richly and raise their voices in exultation when thou appearest. Thou metes! rich measure to us, to nourish the elect, like Ra when he ruled this land. Strong and wakeful is he al all limes, to seek nourishment for the living, to make the corn abundant like the sand of the seashore, and to load the granaries with gifts. Behold, therefore Hi. lIleJesty sought how he might exalt the father of all gods, the prince and ruler of the flood, and meditated like the god Tehuti (Thoth) to find out what was adequate to his love (i ŁŁŁ how he might give most adequate expression to his love). No king hIlS done so since thy time, Oh Ra! And His lIleJesty spoke: 'Whereas the Nile nonrishes the world, and blessing and abundance follow upon his rising, and behold each one lives in his dwelling, enriched through his command; and seeing that I know what stands in the store that is preserved in the library; therefore when the Nile comes forth from his two sources, then let the olferings to the gods be in-creased; but if the holy stream is at SiIsileh 0 Khennu-t).) at the right time, King Ramses II. will redouble the offerings to it there. This king appointed two festivals to be kept at Silsileh in honour of the Nile, as the following portion of the inscription records. One was to be observed at the beginning of its gradual rise (the 111th Epiphi), the other On the 111th Thoth, when the rapid rise set in. L. Stern compares these approl'riately to the two main festivals of the modern Egyptians, the Nig,., olu.. Drop, and the aulling oflA. Dam, which are also two months apart (Vol. I., p. 289). lIerenptah I. and Ramses III. confirmed the grants. made by Ramses II. for the purposes of these festivals, and erected the mentioned steles in commemoration of the fact. The natnre of the grants (sacrificial bread and cakes, antelopes, beef, veal, six kinds of Wine, honey, oil, beer, milk, essences, etc.) is recorded in tbe lists below the inscriptions, from which we also learn that the king offered fowls to the river-gods and as much corn a8 a granary could contain to Ammlln of Thebes. -The side -walls of the two chapels are also occupied with scenes of sacrifice and worship. Various opinions have been expressed as to the reason of the special reverence paid to the Nile at this particular defile. The narrows of 
Silsileh were perhaps dif1lcult or even impossible to pass in earliest antiquity, and so probably came to be regarded as the second entrance of the river into Egypt, the first being at the cataract at Assuau. This is the more probable as Kom Ombo was certainly reckoned as belonging to Nubia. Between the above-mentioned chapels of Ramses II. and ptah, is a small Stele erected by the mayor Panehesi (p. 257), who appears here along with a son of the king accompanying the king before Ammon. The prayer is addressed not only to Ammon, but also to the 'holy water' (mu ab, see above) and to Se.bek. Digitized bYfT'tVOg 1 e

A few· paces farther to the S., and· at a lower level than the steles Ł. is a small Chapel, which in spite of its very minous tion, we can recognize as having been founded by the great buUder 8eti I. The inscriptions on the stele are completely obliterated. -To the right of this chapel is a carefully hewn but empty Reces8, and in the same cliff but facing N. in the direction of the two steles, is a Tablet of a chief-priest of Ammon named Roi, who here appears with Merenptah I. before the god. The Qua,ries on thll W. bank of the NUe are of enormous size, but few traces of inscriptions are now to be found. An InBCt'iptiofl of Amenhotep III., however, records the transport of stones by the for a temple of Ptah (at Memphis?). There are two Poses of the time of Seti I., and Demotic InBCt"ptioos from Roman times. An unfinished colossal Sphinx, nearly opposite the usual place of the dhahabiyehs, is also not without interest. Even if all the monuments of Egypt had disappeared, these huge quarries would serve as a proof that building operations of unsurpassed tent had once been carried on here. The town of Khefmu appears to have stood here, not on the E. bank. A few unimportant ruins may be traced.

Large fragments of the building are even now to be seen sunk beneath the stream, near its edge. On one of these is the dedication inscription, recording that the building had been founded as 'a work to endure for eternity'. The higb-Iying ruins of Kom Ombo are especially picturesque by tbe light of the full moon. A single glance is enougb to reveal to the practised eye that a comparatively late monument lies before the traveller. Ptolemy VII. founded the temple:· cr A,t en "el_ par ptah Ir.heper 80tep tTl amon ar rna ra, Epipbanes son of the gods, begotten by Ptah, chosen by Ammon, making the truth of Ra. Euergetes II., Ptolemy XIII. Neos Dionysus, his wife Cleopatra V., and at a later date Tiberius enlarged the building. It belonged to the Egyptian town : Nub! (Coptic MhO), called by the Greeks OmboB, 88 capital of the district Ombites, which formerly was part of the Nubian nomos, wbile from the Egyptian Nubi they formed names Unbi-Ombi and Omboi It would be a great error to disputel in face of the present building, the existence of an earlier temple on th18 site. A -gateway which existed on the E. side of the girdle-wall down to 1870 showed on its jambs the figure of Tutmes III., builder of the temple, which was named Plio Sebek (temple of the crocodile-headed Sebek) in the inscription of Ram&ka neath. According to Champollion the door-posts were provided by olle of the Ptolemles with a new lintel; the old lintel, dating from Tutmes m., was found on the river-bank in 188S by lIlaspero, along with a door-post bearing the name of Amenhotep 1., and a block of stone with the touche of Ramses the Great. The old temple of Tutmes Ill. probably faeed the east. Oorresponding to the double division ofthis temple, two different triads were espeoially worshipped within it. The chief of the :ftrst was Sebek-Ra with the crocodile-head, along with whom were thor and Khunsu; at the head of the second was Har-war, the elder Horns CArueris), with whom were associated Tasentnefert (the good sister) and her son Pinebtati, lord of both lands. The entire left half of the temple was dedicated to the triad of Aruens, the right half to that of Sebek. The coins of Ombos display a warrior, with a lance in one hand and a crocodile in the other; :ftgures which present Horus and Sebek in the Roman Rtyle. The memory of tbe worship of the two divine brothers in the same temple seems to have lingered in the following legend, related to the writer by a man at Kom Ombo.

town by night. It was then the season for sowing. When the wicked prince awoke, his vizier said to him, 'All thy subjects have left the country along with thy brother; who will now plough the fields?' The wicked prince was very angry when he heard that; but as he was a great magician he said, 'Then the dead must help me'. So he summoned the dead from their graves; and in the morning he beheld from his castle (the temple) the dead at work, ploughing and sowing. But when the harvest came, not a blade grew in the fields, for the dead had carried the ploughs in the air above the earth, and had sowed saDd stead of grain. Then the wicked prince once more was angry and scended from his castle to convince himself with his own eyes of the failure of the harvest. When he saw not only that no blade of corn grew green, but also that the former fields were now covered with sand, he uttered a terrible curset so fearful that his castle fell to the earth, and a block of stone crushed him to death'. The temple of Rom Ombo is a Doubte and it is the only one in Egypt tbat is divided along its longer axis into two tinctly de:O.ned parts. Even the entrance has two portals. In the interior the various chambers are not approached as usual by one door each; everywhere two doorways are seen, separated by broad pillars each of which is a point in the imaginary line indicating the division between the two portions of the temple. The plan of the whole may be made out with perfect certainty, though many of the rooms, especially those towards the rear, are largely sanded up. The temple moreover contained two sanctuaries, a fact which is scarcely surprising after what has been said of the two chief deities, Ameris and Sebek. The RypoBtyle PrOn&OB. -The Doubte Portal of the main temple consists of two doors, framed by three columns and each displaying a concave cornice and a winged sun-disc. The :O.oor of the hypostyle is encumbered with sand. Thirteen columns are still standing, each of which measures no less than 20 ft. round the middle of the shaft. The two corner columns in front are apparently wanting; there were in all three rows of :O.ve or perhaps three rows of seven. The capitals, of great variety of form, belong to the Ptolemaic-Egyptian order; but they differ in various points from those to be seen at Denderah, Esneh, and Edtu. The middle colnmn in the back row has a calyx-capital, with a foliage-cup displapng a unique ornamentation, with· three flowers and three b1lds ing from it. The un1l.nished calyx-capital of the mOlt northerly column in the same (rear) row has, at its base, a wreath of flowers with serrated edges, between which are arranged paus of buds, each pair surmounted by a six-pointed star, though elsewhere the tian star is always flve-pointed *.

To the right (Sebek side): in the lower row, is King Euergetes 11. presenting wine to Shu and Tefnut, farther to the right, the king with two nosegays before Seb, the ftrst born of the gods, and Sebek Nubti; then the king before the celestial goddess Nut, mother of the gods, and Bathor, mistress of Nubt; and ftnaIly before Osiris, Isis, and Nephthys (partly brOken).

The presentation of the two eyes (Uza) refers to the united lands of Lower and Upper Egypt, or perhaps to Nubia and Egypt, of which the temple of OmboB was a representation. The name of City of the two Usa, moreover, is frequently bestowed upon Ombos, and was perhaps its sacred name. -In a third scene, in the upper row, the king presents two vessels to Barwar and Hathor. -In the lower row, the king presents the seated ftgure of Milo to Harwar, Tasentnefen, and Pinebtati.

From this tion it appears that the garrison and ofBcials of the Nubian district, which included Umbos, undertook an adornment of the tsmple of the gods, to whom they applied the Egyptian name Aroeris (Harwar) and the Greek name Apollo, in gratitude for some special mark of favour shown to them by the gods.

I' VWIMI 0 (j .-&) The name Bu" means 'the place affording an opening or entrance', becanse here the threshold of Egypt was crossed. 'l'ho name seldom occurs in hieroglyphic inscriptions, because the metropolis or chief town of the nome to which Sun belonged, was ElephanUno, on the island of that name. The place, however, is very ancient, for even under the 6th Dyn., the granite required by the builders of Lower Egypt was furnished by the quarries in its neighbourhood. In later times the city of the cataracts was frequently referred to by Greek and Roman writers under the name of Syene. It acquired special fame on account of its well (see below), and as the place of banishment of Ju ŁŁ nQl in his old age. . The Wdl of Byene, in which there was no shadow at midday, and wbich thus seemed to prove that Byene was situated under the tropic, has peared. The report ofits existence led the learned Athenian E'"Glollhllfl .. (276-196 B.C.), attached to the Museum at Alexandria, to the discovery of the method of measuring the size of the earth that is still employed. 'He selected the arc of the earth between Alexandria and Byene (Assu'n) on the Nile, of which place he assnmed that it was in the same meridian. Bince he knew that the midday sun at the summer solstice cast no shadow within a radius of stadia from Byene, and that in Alexandria at the same time the angle determined by the shadow of the Bun-gnomon was equal to one-fiftieth of a circle, he correctly concluded that the distance b,'tween Alexandria and Byene must equal the fiftieth part of a meridian circle, Or 7° 12'. t The distance from Alexl\Ildria to Byene was taken by Erato.thenes simply at the popular estimate of 0300 stadia, equal to Ii98 H. (Lepsius) or 1i18 M. (Hultsch). Pelchd. -A glance at the map shows that AssuRn no longer lies under the tropic of Cancer, but somewhat to the N. of it, so that no shadowless well can exist there at present; but it has been celculated that in the 4th cent. B.C. Byene ",,'uallg lall "acUg .."d.,. Ih. wop'c, whence we may gather that the Egyptians most have noticed the shadow less well long before Eratosthenes and must have known the trne situaUon of the tropic. Ju_l was still living under Hadrian; but it is not quite certain whether, as is usually assumed, he was sent to Egypt by DomiUan. The rhetorician and satirist, while living in Rome, had fiercely attacked the actor Paris, who was a court-favourite, and he was on that account removed from the capital. He was not exactly banished but appointed prefect of the garrison at Byene, on the most remote fronUer of the empire. His trenchant mose found abundant material on the banks of the Nile. His 15th Batire describes the contest between the inhabitants of Ombos and Tentyra (Denderah) at a festival at Koptos. The two hostile nomes, whom he erroneously calls neighbours (,vieinos'), had long cherished a mutuel enmity on account of the gods they worshipped. At Tentyra the crocodile was persecuted, while it was held sacred at Tentyra for the sake of Sebek who was worshipped there. Thus arose .. strife resembling that mentioned on p. 7. The TentyriUana even slew a man of Umbos and devoured him. Juvenal is indignant, and indicates that his residence on the Nile had by no means taught him to love the Egyptians. If he composed the 15th satire at Byene, that town has the honour of being the birth-place of the following fine verses: -'That nature gave the noble man a heart' 'She proves heraelf, by giving him tears! 'This is the noblest part of all human nature'. The 18th BaUre, in which Egypt is again mentioned, seemS to be ously ascribed to Juvenal. Doubts also attach to the authenticity of a frequently quoted edict of the emperor Dioclellan, ordering the Christian t The actual difference between Alexandria (lito 12') and Assuan (24° 5' 90") is ouly 7° 6' 00".

Climbing up to the right from this double tomb we tlnd several other tombs, most of which have no inscriptions. One belongs to i Ll'OI son of Ap& and of Pmatmai. A four-line scription over the entrance mentions festivals of the dead. Another important tomb is No. 31, belonging to Banub-kaunekht (8 U U 
U) I who appears from his name to have been a high official under Amenemha I. It seems also to be the sepulchre of his son (1) Si Renput (son of Satihotep), whose portrait is of frequent occurrence in this tomb and who is named commander of the light troops in the S. frontier districts. Beyond a narrow passage follows a hall with 6 square columns, and then another passage with three recesses on each side, the tlrst on the left containing a bearded tlgure of Osiris. At the end of the second passage is a small chamber with four columns, whence a long passage leads to the right to a quadruple shaft. Farther on, at the top of another ascent, is a tomb, named after the Prince of Naples who was present at its opening, and ing to Baikhenu, a priest at the pyramid of Pepi II. (p.2.69). Then the large sepulchres of Khunea and 8emnes. Finally on the N.

To the right and left of the trance are some half-defaced inscriptions. The antechamber has seven pillars, on one of which (to the right) reference is made to a campaign undertaken by the king for the subjection of a hostile tribe (Kat?). Another important inscription (unfortunately aged), over the entrance to the rock-tomb proper, treats of the influential position enjoyed by Si Renput under the king and in the campaign against Kush (Ethiopia). To the left scenes of spearing and fowling, and cattle. In the interior are a smail style hall, a long passage, and then another tetrastyle hall, at the back of which is a recess.

The entire visit takes barely an hour. Elephantine was a place of great sanctity from a very early riod among the anl'ient Egyptians. It formed a nome by itself with a ·capital, named like the entire island t j 5: All and also Q r"e-,. All was the Egyptian for elephant, 50 that Elephantine -ntO· is merely the Greek translation of a native name. The Arabs call it simply Gesif'eIi, i.e. island, or Gestret A3ftUm; and it is also said to be named er.-Zah,,. or 'the blooming'. Though the vegetation is lUxuriant in many spots, the writer never heard the last-given name applied to it. The Egyptian priests deseribed the BotWce 01 Ille Nile a. a mystery, that would only be revealed to the soul at the twelfth gate of the world; yet at the same time, they pointed out the 'symbolieal sources of the Nile" so to speak, iu the eddies among 0 06f to the S. of Ele phantlne. They named these , <=:>:::::0 III i.6. the KerN or sources of Elephantine. Herodotus heard of these from a scribe in the treasvy of the temple of Athena at Sals. The nassian thought that the priest was but jesting wheu he told him thd between Syene and Ele:phanUne lay two lofty peaked mountains, Krophi and )(ophi, from the mIdst of which gushed the bottomless sources of the Nile, one half of which flowed to the N. to Egypt, the other half to the S. to Ethiopia. -However foolish this opinion, which Seneca aJao reports, may appear, it was not pure invention, for the monuments inform us that the people were really taught to believe that the Egyptian Nile had his abode among the rapids to the 8. of Elephantine. 80me located it to the N. of the island of Bigeh-Senem (p. 297). Khnum, the god of cataracts, was revered before all other gods on this island; and next to him ranked 8ali (a form of Isls-80this), because the beginning of the inundation cided with the early rising of this constellation, and the cataract may be regarded as the threshold of the swollen Nile entering Egypt. In the year 1822 Moq.ammed 'Ali, in order to build a palace for himself at AS5uan, caused the destruction of the Temple of Khnum, built under Amenhotep ill. of the 18. Dyn. near the S. end of the island, and also of a smaller Temple of Ill., lying more to the N.W., and known as the N. temple. Travellers pass the latter on their way to the city, in whose N. outskirts it lay. The savants of the French Expedition saw this temple before its destruction and published views ot it. Now all that is to be seen on the island are some huge heaps of ruins, a granite doorway of the time of der I., and a granite Statue of Mef'enptah I. Blocks of stone and sculptured fragments lie aJOund. The inhabitants of the' two villages on the island, many of whom understand nothing but Nubian, offer coins, small antiquities (many tations), and fragments of pottery with inscriptions (ostraca) for sale.

By far the most interesting object 011 the island is the meter, on the W. side facing Assuan, known to the AraBs as Milpyt2s. The learned court-astronomer of the Khedive, Mahmdd Bey, restored this well-preserved monument to use in 1870. Btrabo gives the following excellent description, which is interesting to compare with the monument as it now exists. 'The Nilometer is a well built of regular hewn stones, on the bank of the Nile, in which is recorded the rise of the stream, not only the maximum but also the minimum and average rise, for the water in the well rises and falls with the stream. On the side of the well are marks, ing the oomplete rise of the water and all the other degrees of its rising. These are observed and pUblished for general information'. Readers are referred to our account of the Millyas at Cairo (Vol. I., p. 319). The Nilometer at Elephantine consists ofa narrow rooliesS chamber, connected with the stream, and is reached by 52 steps in 6 fiights. The lowest landing is reckoned as" Arabian ells or about 7 ft. above the lowest water level (the dir'a or Arabian ell being equal to 04 centimetres or about 21t/a inches). Above that point 13 ells are marked, so that the highest point marked is 30 ft. (17 Arab. ells) above the minimum water-level. Each ell is'divided on the side of the well into 6 parts and 24 kirat. The 13 old tian ells, each divided into 7 sjlans and 28 fingers, have a total length of 6,895 metres (about 20 ft.), from which Mahmdd Dey obtained 53 centimetres as the equivalent for an ell instead of the previously accepted 521f2 centimetres. The water-level tuates actually between the top of the first ell and the seventeenth, i.e. has a range at Assuan of 16 ells of 54 centimetres each. The old and new marks ale placed on every third step. From the face of the water upwards are 11 marks, of which, however, only the half are necessary, as the Nile no longer rises higher. Close beside the river, farther to the N., lies a massive BomaR Structure, 'built of hewn blocks from earlier editlces. Many of these blocks are covered with inscriptions of different dates, cluding fragmentary lists of offerings and festival calendars and a portion of a Nilometer. The rock-inscriptions close to the stream should also be noticed. They include inscription.' by Neferkara (Pepi), Unas, Antef aa, with one by Amenemha on the other side. The higher parts of the island command a fine ·View of the black and brown, rough and smooth rocks of the cateract, among which the Nile, split up into many sm&l1 branches, sometimes dashes in foaming energy, sometimes fiows in unrumed calmness.

Some haul on the ropes from the bank, others guide the course of the vessel with poles from on board, and others in the water keep it upright or ward it off from striking on sharp rocks in the river-bed. Old men, young mell, and boys rival each other in the most exhausting activity, that seems almost frantic, from its never-ceasing accompaniment of shouts, eries, and chants. Every saint in the calendar is invoked, especially the beneficent Sa'ld, who is belie'l'ed' to render especially effective aid in sudden dangers. At the most difficult point, the Bab el-Kllbir (p. '278) boys, for a small fee, will plunge head-first into the stream, to rea.ppear a.stride pieces of wood below the boiling surf, through which they swim with marvellous skill. If the work is not plished before sun-set, it is left unfinished till next morning. -It may be remarked that the Egyptian government contemplates widening the channel and introducing fixed regulations for the psssage. -The time occupied in taking the dhahabiyeh through the rapids may be advantageously turned to account by the traveller by first inspecting the cataract from the bank and then, by proceeding by land to Philae, where he should pitch his tent or take up his abode in the Osiris room (p.

Y j within Abu (Elephantine) is named. Several attractive houses, one belonging to a wealthy Jew, form a kind of suburb bere. To tbe left of the road lies the small TEMPLE, founded by lemy III. Euergetes and adorned by Ptolemy IV. Philopator, but never entirely completed. On tbe left of the is Euergetes I. and bis wife Berenice II., before Isis in Sun (Syene). Isis is named conductress of the soldiers, because the frontier-town and its bourhood were strongly garrisoned from very early times as well as under tbe Romans. (Under the Romans the Cobors Quinta sium was stationed at Contra Syme, the Cohors Sexta Saginarum in the Caatra Lapidariorum, on the E. bank to tbe S. of Syene, the Cobors Prima Felix Tbeodosiana on Elephantine, and the Legio Prima Maximiana on Phila.) Next appears Ptulmis, son of getes, otberwise Philopator, before Khnum, Sati, and Anuke, wbo each wears bis special head-dress. On the right side of the is Euergetes I., before Sebek and Hathor, and otrering incense before Osiris Unnofet (the good), Isis, and the child Horus. On the inner sides of the two doors leading to the antechamber with its two square columns, 
and on the inner side of the door to the adytum, are inscribed stirring Hymna to laia-Bothia, to whom apparently tbe little temple was dedicated. To the left, on the ter door, are e.g. the words: 'Thou burl est forth (sati) the Nile, that he-may fertilize the land in thy name of Sothis, thou bracest (ank) the lI.elds. to make .them fertile in thy name of Ankht. All beings .on earth exist through thee, through thy name of Ankht ('the living'). . Unusually thick in the Brst and largest chamber of the temple support flat Gt-eek abaci, upon which rests a broad but Bat architrave.

Texts from the Koran are not uncommon, ill spite of the Prophet's express command that the name of God and passages from the Koran should never be placed upon tombstones. 'rhe tombs of the richer dead are smaIl domed erections. On the summit of the hill to the right of the road are some large like Cenotaphs, dedicated to famous saints, such' as the Shekh mild, the Sh6kh 'Ali, our lady (sitte) Zeinab, etc., whose memory is celebrated by festivals on their birthdays, etc. 3. THE QUARRIES (Arabic Ma'ad1n). About t/, hr. beyond Assuan we quit the road and tum to the E. (left). In a few minutes more we reach the verge of a hill, on which blocks of granite are scattered both singly and in heaps. A moderately lofty cliff beyond shows manifold traces of the industry of the ancient builders, who, from the erection of the pyramids to the time of the Ptolemies, drew their supplies of grauite from the quarries of Syene. Almost all the granite pillars, columns, traves, roof-slabs, obelisks, and statues that we have hitherto seen in Egypt, hail from this spot. By.,.;I. owes its name to the early Greek form of the name of AaSIl&n (8/1.ne), although the stone here found is far too poor in hornblende to be reckoned true syenite at all. t Harlmann describes it as follows: -The granite, which interrupts the sandstone at the eataracts of Assua.., is of a reddish hue, caused by bright rose-coloured orthoclase. It tains a large proporiion of translucent quartz, yellOW, brownish, pink, and black mica, and only a little hornblende. Huge coarse-grained masse. of this composition are here found and also hard line-grained masses, taining much red felapar, but little quartz and very little mica. Veins also occur rich in dark mica and greenish oligoclase, and containing a little pinite; and finally veins of a dark green diorite, in which the portion of hornblende is much greater than that of albite'. The glaze on the rocks of the cataracts is noticed on p. Z79. The diligent hands of the stone-cutters of'the Pharaohs have left distinct traces behind them. The method in which the blocks were quarried in tiers may still be distinctly seen on a cliff faoing the N., about 8 min. to the N.E. of the town. The skill with which huge masses were handled and detached without injury from the eWf to which they belonged, is absolutely marvellous. The certainty of the process adopted is amply vouched for by the fact that obelisks were completely finished on three sides before they were finally detached t This curious fact is explained by Prof. Zirkel as follow.. The term 81/""il., which occurs in Pliny, was first employed in a acientUlc sense by Werner in 1788, who applied it to the characteristic atone formed of orthoclase felspar and black hornblende, found in the Plauensehe Orund, in Saxony. Thenceforth tbat minerai was accepted as the typical.yenite. Wad subsequently proved that the stone quarried al Syene was Dot syenite at all, i .Ł. that Its formation was 9ulte dUferent from that of the rock. in the PlaueDsche Grund. When Roz,ere discovered true .yenite on Mount Sinai he proposed to alter Us name alightly and to call U Si"IIriU, a suggestion, however, which bas never been adopted. DigitIZed by Coogle

Such an Obelisk, still attached to the rock, may be seen about 1/2 M. to the S. of the town and about as far to the E. of the Nile. It is not easlly fouild, as it is frequently more than half-covered with sand. At its broadest part this obelisk measures 101/2 ft.; its length is 92 ft. (72 ft. cut out), not reckoning the pyramidal top, which has already been hewn. The economy of material on the part of the stone-cutters is noteworthy. In the quarry near the road and visited by all travellers, is a huge BIoc1c of Rock, from which the mason has begun to hew both a roollug-slab and a column. Here we clearly perceive that the ancients well understood how to disintegrate the granite with borers and to split it with wedges. Numerous holes were made in a hed line (probably with the help of draw-boring), the damp wooden wedges were driven in, and in this manner tolerably even fractures were tained. The art of splitting the stone by heat was also understood. The Claapd transported from Elephantine (i.t. AlBuAn) to by Aabmes (26th Dyn.) was especially celebrated, and is mentioned by dotus (II, 17/1). It consisted of a single block and its transport occupied 2000 men for 3 years. It is said to have been 21 ells long, 14 broad, and 8 high, outside measurement; and 186/. ells long, 12 broad, and Ii high, inside measurement. It had to remain outside the temple at Sals, on account of lis size and weight. Still more striking, in point of weight at least were the Slalu. 01 Ramlse II. transported hence to the Rameaseum (p. 162), and a stone Chapel, aeen by Herodotus (I, 1M) at Buto. The latter was cubical in form and measured 40 ens each way; and it has been estimated that its weight must have been about 7000 shipping-tons, or more than twiee the burden of a large East Indiaman. 4. THB ANOIENT ROAD AND THB BRICK WALL. We turn to the right (W.) from the quarries and follow the broad sandy road leading S. to Phllle. The desert has a wonderful serving virtue. If the road along which the traveller now rides were practicable for carriages, Strabo's description would still At it in every point. 'We drove', writes the ancient geographer, 'from Syene (Assuan) to Phille, through a very fiat plain about 00 stadia long. At many points all along the road, and on both sides, we saw the rounded, smooth, and almost conical blocks of dark, hard rock, sembling Hermes-towers, from which mortsrs are made. Smaller blocks lie upon larger ones, and support others in clieir turn; here and there were isolated blocks', etc. -To this we need only add that pious pilgrims and wayfarers have chiselled their Names and ""Of'e In3Cf'iption3 on many of the above-mentioned blocks. Princes, dignUled priests, and warriors, have travelled this way, as rar back as the times of the Amenemhas and Usertesens. Down to a late period pilgrims were in the habit of placing inscriptions on these stones, accompanied with the representation of the soles of the feet.

A Stele also, of the second year of Ramses the Great, shows on the left Ammon and on the right Khnum presenting the ,hop .. h or .word of victory to the king, who graspa a negro by the hair. Many other ancient reliefs and inscriptions will be found by the careful seeker, both along this road and beside the Nile In the tion of and beside A8suan. t By-and-by we perceive considerable fragments of a high Brielr WaU, built to protect the road irom the attacks of the BlemmJes (p. 302) and also perhaps from the shifting sand. Strabo, curiously enough, does not mention it. It first appears to the right CW.) ofthe road, crosses it twice, remains then on the E. side, and ends on theftat bank opposite Philm. It is 6 ft. broad, and at some places 13 ft. high. As this curious erection is almost entirely destroyed or covered with sand in the neighbourhood of Assuan, and as there are also other points of interest on the land-route to Philm (the inscriptions are most numerous near the island), no one who has a reasonable time to devote to the ngion of the first catsract, shouId fail to traverse this route once at least. The view of Philm, as the traveller approaches the end of his journey, will never be forgotten. c. :&cute partl,. through the Desert, partl,. beside the Oataract .. This route is recommended to those who have arrived by steamer and have time to go to Philm and ·back once only. The return to Assuln is usually made (when there is moonlight invariably) after 
sunset, in which case, however, the traveller follows the route all the way and sees nothing oUhe cataract. The rocky nature of the river-bank renders it impossible to skirt the stream during the first half of the distance from Assuan to Philm. After visiting the quarries, therefore, we follow the above-described desert-route for about 1/2 hr. towards the S., then enter a path diverging to the right (W.), which brings us in about an hour after quItting suan to the rocky bank of the river, whose hoarse roar is heard for some time before. Hence we ale conducted to the rocks known as the Bibb esh-8hellAl, or 'gates of the cataracts', that with the largest fall being known as Bab el-Kebir or 'great gate'. Here we may be fortunate enough to see a boat guided through the rapids j but in any case there are always naked young Nubians ready to plunge into the river and allow themselves to be carried down by the foaming stream, either astride of a tree-trunk or floating supported in the water, in the manner described long 
ago bJ Strabo. The air of course resounds with shouts and requests for bakshish. Those who expect to see a cascade like the falls of the Rhine at Schatl'hausen will be disappointed. The foaming and impetuous stream makes noise enough as it dashes through its rocky bed, but there is nothing here in the shape of a regular waterfall.

When the river is high all the rocks in the bed of the stream are under water j but in February and March even the smaller rocks are visible. In'Cf"iptiom are found on many ofthese, and on all the cataract-islands, twenty in number. The smooth glaze, like a dark enamel, which covers the rocks between this point and PhUm will not escape notice. A similar effect was noUced by Alexander von· Humboldt at the cataracts of the Orinoco. 'The granite of Assuan', says R. Hartmann, 'like that at the southern eataraets, etc., Is distinguished by the ably rounded shape of the blocks. These have surfaces as smooth as glass, and are of a black hue, glistening In the sun, like the fiat surface of a well-used smoothing-iron. The almo.t spherical shape seems to be due to the attrition of the detritus washed down by the stream. The dark colour, which only penetrates a few lines, as is easily seen in tached fragments, is caused by protoxide of iron accordiug to RUlSegger, or by sUica according to Delesse, precipitated on the Itone by the water". A few yards to the S. of the cataract lie the pleasant villages ofKahldah and SheIlU, shaded by palms and sycamores. In bidah huge piles of dried dates lie in the open air, brought hither from Nubia for transport to Egypt. At this point begins the passage of the rapids downstream; and boats (or dhahaMyehs for large ties) may be hired here, if desired, for the safe voyage to PhUm through a picturesque rocky landscape. A bargain should be struck before the boat is entered. A small boat costs 10 piastres by tariff; a dhahabtyeh not less than 10 fro The boatmen demand much larger sums at llrst. DESCENT OF THB CATARACT IN A SHALL BOAT. This expedition can hardly be recommended, for even when the river is full it is not attended with danger. H. Brugsch and Ebers both accomplished It. The latler records that he looks back upon the experience not without pleasure, especially on account of the extraordinary skill and presence of mind of the cataract-re'is who steered. He describes the trip as follows. 'I had two of our own sailors on board, one able· bodied, the other a Nubian little more than a boy .. The old cataract·re'is was at the helm. The roar of the eataract was heard beyond the village of Shellal, and became louder every minute as we proceeded. The rocks and stones in the bed are reddish brown, but wherever they have been washed by the stream and then dried by the scorching 8un of this latitude, they glisten like the black surface of an evaporating pond. Behind and before, to the right and left, above and below, 1 saw nothing but rocks, little pools, and the blue sky; wbile my sense of hearing was as though spell-bound by the roar of the waters, which as soon as the keel of the boat approached the rapids proper, lifted up their voice as loud as surf lashing against a rocky coast in a storm. Then followed some minutes .of tbe most intense exertion for the crew, who cheered and encouraged themselves by tinual invocations to helpful saints, especially to tho holy Said, the rescuer from sudden dangers. With each stroke of the oars broke forth a 'ya Said' (0 Said) or 'ya lIohlbnmed' or 'God is gracious'; while the arms wielding the oars dared not relax their strength, at it was essential to keep In the middle of the rapids in order to avoid being hurled against the rocks.

When the path, covered with granite-dust, grows narrower and begins to lead over smooth granite, the traveller should mount. The curiously-shaped rocks in the bed and on the bank of the Nile bear numerous inscriptions. Some of them look a8 though they had been built up out of artiflcially rounded blocks. These forms seem to have struck the ancient Egyptians most forcibly, for'in the relief of the Source of the Nile at Phillll (p. 294) -one of the few representations of landscape in Egypt -the river-god crouches under a pile of blocks like these. In 25 min. we reach a small plain and obtain a charming view of Phila, the most beautiful spot on the Nile, and the goal of travellers who do not wish to go on to the second cataract. The small plain above-mentioned, to the E. of the island, is shaded with handsome sycamore trees, near which is a long low building ola semi-European appearance, with battlemented roof. This is the deserted station of the Roman Catholic missionaries, who hence founded settlements in Central Africa, all of which, ever; including flnally that at Khar\ftm, have been abandoned.

Travellers to Nubia who are unable to find time to visit Phillie on the outward journey, not fail to devote to it at least a few hours on the returu, either on the evening of reaching SheWU, or on the next morning, after spending the night on board the steamer. When more than one visit is paid the eller should come once by rail, once by land returning by boat. commodation at Phillie can only be obtained if a dba.babtyeh happens to be there. The name of PhilllJ is derived from the old Egyptian, in which it is called, with the article, Pa-alek 0 <:::>, or usually mere-E3 Ll E13Ll e Iy Alek Ł This name thousands of times on the <:::>0 e island itself, with many variations, and probably means the island of Lek, i.e. of Clasing or of the End t, referring to the Nile-voyage hither from the N. The Copts called it Pilak or Petak, and the Arabs used to call it Bilak. Now-a-days none of these names are known to the natives, who usually call the island Anaa el-Wogild, after the hero of one of the tales in the Thousand and One Nights, which has undergone considerable change in the Egyptian version and has its scene transferred to Phillil. The boatmen relate it as follows. 'Once upon a time was a king, who had a handsome favourite named Ana, .1-WOlldd, and a vizier, whose daughter was named Zahr el-Ward, j.e. Flower of the Rose. The two young people saw and fell in love with each other, and found tunities of meeting secretly, until they were discovered through the prudence of the maiden's attendant. The vizier was violently enraged and, in order to seCure his daughter from the farther pursuit of the young man, despatched her to the island of Phillie, where he caused her to be imprisoned in a strong castle (the temt'le of Isis) and e!osely guarded. But Anas el-Wogdd could not forget hIS love. He forsook the court and wandered far and wide in search of her, and in the courSe of his travels showed kindness to various animals in the desert and where. At last a hermit him that he would Ond Zahr el-Ward on the island of Phil",. He arrived on bank of the river and beheld the walls of the castle, but was unable to reach the island, for the water all around it was alive with crocodiles. As he stood lamenting his fate one of the dangerous monaters offered to convey him to the island on his back, out of gratitude for the young man's previous kindness to animals. The lover was thus able to reach the prison of his mistress, and the guards suffered him to remain· on the island, as he represented himself to be a persecuted merchant from a land. Birds belonging to Zahr el-Ward assured him that abe was on the Island, but he eould never obtain sight of her. Meanwhile the lady also became unable longer to endure her fate. Letting herself down from her prison-window by means of a rope made of her clothes, she found a compassionate ship-master, who conveyed her from the island in which the lover she sought then was. Then followed another period of search and finally the meeting of lovers. A marriage, with the consent of the father, ends the tale. -The O"ri, Room on Philre (p. 2911) is regarded by the Arabs as the bridal-chamber.

Arabian Nights ends as follows: 'So they lived in the bosom of happiness to the advanced age, in whieh the roses of enjoyment shed their leaves and tender friendship must take the place of passion" t It seems as though this legend had arisen on Egypt soil, and as though it contained some echoes of the ancient mythology of Phillll, e.g. the search of Isis for her beloved Osiris and the disposal of the goddess on an island in the Nile. It is even more remarkable that Anas el-Wogo.d reached the island on a crocodile and that on the W. side of the temple of Isis is a relief (p. 2.94) representing the mummy of Osiris borne by a crocodile .. The rocky island of Bigeh, opposite Phillll, seems to have been an even earlier pilgrim-resort than the latter j yet there was probably a temple also on Phillil in comparatively early times. In the 4th cent. B.C. this must have been either unim ortant or in ruins, for the name of Nekht nebf (W ""=7 I Nect-anebus II., is the oldest name occurring as that of a builder, and that prince reigned as a rival king to the Persian Achlllmenides and recognized only by his countrymen, at the date mentioned. The work that he began was zealously continued by the Ptolemies, who had greater resources at command, but even they left ample room tor additional buildings and farther decorations at the hands of the Roman perors down to Diocletian. The principal temple, like the island itself, was sacred to [';', whose priests resided here down to comparatively late times as a learned COllege. As one of the graves of Osiris was situated here, it early became a pilgrimage resort for the Egyptians, one of whose solemn oaths also was by the Osiris of Phillll. When the cult of Isis as well as that of Serapis became known to the Hellenes and afterwards to the Romans, many Greek and Italian pilgrims tlocked to the shrine of the mysterious, benign, and healing goddess. Even under Ptolemy Physkon the priests were compelled to petition the king to check the superabundant stream of pilgrims, who consumed the temple-stores and threatened to reduce the priests to the sity of withholding from the gods their bounden offerings (comp. p. 2.84). On all the walls and columns of the temple are tions, placed there by Greek or Roman offlcials, tourists, and grims. They are most numerous in the S. part of the temple and in t In the Thousand and One Nights this tale occupies the S7ht to the SSOth nights.

History. PBILAi:. 29. Route. 283 ·the oldest part, dating from Nectanebus. We know also that the goddess of PhillB was worshipped by the Blemmyes (p. 302), who maintained the custom of human sacrifices until the time of nian. After Diocletian, who personally visited the island, had quered these restless children of the desert, he destroyed the fortifications of PhillB, and new temples -were erected in which priests of the Blemmyes and Nobades were permitted to offer sacrifices to Isis along with the Egyptian priests. And these tribes even obtained the right of removing the miraculous image of the mighty goddess from the island at certain solemn festivals and of retaining it for some time. Even after all Egypt had long been christianized and the Theba'id was crowded with monks, the ancient pagan-worship still held sway in Nubia, in spite of the Edicts of Theodosius. The Nobades were converted to Christianity about 640 A.D. under the auspices of the Empress Theodora, and shortly afterwards Narses, sent by Justinian to Egypt, closed the temple of Isis on PhillB, and sent its sacred contents to ople. At first the people of Philal adopted the orthodox creed, but when Egypt was conquered by IsUm, they exchanged this for the monophysite heresy. Although an inscription has been found in the pronaos in praise of a Bishop Theodorus (577 A.D.), who dicated a portion at least of the temple of Isis to St. Stephen, it is doubtful whether Philal was ever an episcopal seat. It is certain, however, that Christian services were held in the hypostyle. The inscriptions and reliefs were plastered over with Nile-mud or had crosses carved upon them, so as to spare the feelings of the ful and to exorcise the evil spirits. -Like Christianity, isUm was late in finding its way to Philal, and there is not a trace of a mosque or anything of that nature on the entire island. Nubia was tually conquered in the 13th cent. by the Egyptian sultans, who included the cataract-region in their private domains, and thus secured the temples from destruction. -Philal was described ill 1737 by Norden and Pococke, though at that time the natives were as hostile to strangers as they are now friendly and obliging. lsi8, the chief deity of the island, is usually represented in the triad completed by Osiris and Borus, but she frequently also appears alone. Everywhere, in her various forms, she occupies the foremost place, just as Bathor does at Denderah. The deities of Philal include Ra and Menth, the twin-gods Shu and Tefnut, Seb and Nut, Osiris-Unnofer (Agathodalmon) and Isis, Khnum and Sati, the gods of the cataracts, Horus the son of Isis, Bathor, and the child Horus. Thoth, Safekh, and other deities also frequently appear. PhilC! is the pearl of Egypt, and those who have several days to spend at the cataract, should certainly take up their abode upon it.

The view of PhillB from the river-bank is expectedly beautiful, especially to those who have just quitted the rugged rooks of the cataract or the arid desert; while, on the other hand, the views from the island, especially from its rocky S. end, are imposing and sometimes peculiarly wild. The buildings on the island whioh demand a visit are: 1. The Ł Temple of lsi,; 2. The Ohapet of Hathof'; 3. The RuiM and the Porlat of Diocletian, in the N.W.; and 4. The *Kiosque. -Bigeh and the Cataract ],land. also repay a visit. The Temple of 18i8. This beautiful struoture dates from various periods, and its different parts show an almost capricious irregularity in their sitions with reference to each other. The traveller is recommended to visit the various portions in the following order, but he is warned against lingering too long over any of them, if his time be limited or if his inspection have no special scienti1ic aim. It is better to obtain a good general impression from the whole, than to examine the details minutely. In order to understand the arrangement of tbe temple, it must not be forgotten that it wal preeminently a pilgrim -resort. The processions of pilgrims, whether they proached trom Egypt or from Nubia, were compelled to steer for the S. end of the island, for the rocks to the N. of it prevented anything like a ceremonial approach. The portals of the temple therefore faced the S., and the festal boats disembarked their sengers on the S. coast. We likewise begin our visit from the S., or more exactly from the extreme S.W., to which we proceed direct from the landing-place. Our attention is 1ir8t attracted by the strong erection of hewn stones facing the stream. The steps of a Stone Staircase within the quay-wall are still to be seen on the S.W. coast; and there was another staircase on the S. coast, to the E. of the building of Nectanebus. a. The Building of B'ectanebuB (PI. A). Two Obelisks flanked the entrance to the byprethral Fore-Oourt, which the pilgrim entered 1irst, and where he was received, and perhaps also examined and taxed. With the exception of the central portion of the flrst pylon (p. 287), dating from this same king, Nectanebus II., this is the oldest part of the whole temple. The obelisks, made of sandstone, instead of the usual granite, were small and stood upon stone chests. The W. obelisk is still standing, but the E. obelisk is represented by its chest merely. The E. obelisk itself was found prostrate by Bankes in 1815, and at biB request removed to Alexandria by Belzoni, despite the protests or Drovetti who regarded It as his private property.

Above tbis are two other inscriptions, only fragments of wbich are served, in whieb the granting of the petition by the king and the sequent royal decree are announced. This obelisk bas been of the greatest importance for the interpretation of the Egyptian bieroglypbics. Tbe names of Ptolemy Euergetes and Cleopatra. whicb occur in Greek on the pedestal, were discovered by Cbampollion in 1822 on the obelisk itself, and from tbe latter name be was enabled to add a few more alphabetical signs to those already tained from the Rosetta decree (Vol. I., p. 111). The W. Obelisk, as we have said, remains in Bitu though it has lost its point. Upon it is inscribed, in Greek, a petition from dotos, son of Agesiphon, to Isis and her fellow-gods, dating from the time of Neos Dionysus. There are also some Arabic inscriptions. The hyplilthral vestibule was bounded on each side (E. and W.) by six columns and one of the obelisks. The six W. columns are still standi.ng, but only three stumps of the E. row remain. Between the columns were screen-walls, half as high as the shafts, and with concave cornices and balustrades of Urlilus-serpents. The columns, only '},1/6 ft. in thickness, are 101/S ft. high, and have calyx -capitals supporting an abacus decorated with the mask, on which rests a small chapel. These capitals, which semble those of the Ptolemaic epoch, are specially remarkable, as they were erected by Nectanebus before the period of the Lagidlil. Nectanebus who maintained himself for some time in opposition to the Persian kings, appears to have delighted in comparing himself to the ancient Pharaohs, as we may gather from his lIrst name kheper-ka, which was also that of Usertesen I. of the 12th Dyn.; and it is possible that he adopted, in the Eame spirit, old and gotten artistic forms in his erections. It is certain that the mask at the top of the columns is only found earlier than his time on the monuments of the 18th Dyn. at Der el-balJ.ri (p. 223) and el-KAb (p. 236). The architects of the Ptolemieswere afterwards tracted by the abacus adorned with the countenance of the goddess ofDenderah, adopted it, and farther developed the sculptured capital, here lIrst introduced by Nectanebus. -On the W. and E. sides of each of the six standing columns are dedication-inscriptions. On the outer (W.) side of the most southerly column (next to the obelisk) is the inscription: 'The good god, lord of both worlds, Ra-kheper-ka, son of the sun and lord of the diadems, Nectanebus, the ever-living, erected this sumptuous building for his mother IsiS, the bestower of life, in order to enlarge ber dwelling with cellent work, for time and for eternity'. -On the outer side of tho E:3Ll third column the name of Phillil appears as Alek (with the article, P-alek), a form found at many other places, and the mistress of the island is named as n Sf-E:3 =:;, Digitized

286 pmL..£. Temple Isis, the life giving goddess of Aab, i.e. of Abaton or the holy land. The last name deserves mention here, for the spot known to the ancients as Abaton, which must have been peculiarly holy in their eyes, is named innumerable times in the inscriptions of the temple of Isis. It must therefore be looked for on Phil81 itself. The inscription on the Architra"e of the outer or West Bide states that the king erected this building for his mother Isis, and that he built the hall for her of good white hewn stone, surrounded with columns, with inscriptions throughout its whole extent, and, as the line below the architrave adds, painted in colours. The inner side of the architrave bears an invocation to Isis, mother of the gods. This little temple had doors on the E. and W. side., not, however, opposite to each other, and another on the N. side, next the main temple. The last leads into a spacious Pore-Court (PI. B), enclosed on the right and left by covered Colonnades. The W. colonnade (Pl. F) follows the bank of the river, while that to the E. or right (Pl. D) runs in the direotion of the centre of the 11rst great pylon, but not at right angles to it, affording an example of the variety of uial direction exhibited throughout the temple. When we remember that a portion of the 11rst pylon and the hyp8lthral space, which we have just quitted, were built by nebus, and that all the other parts of the temple are of later dsta, we have an adequate explanation of the great irregularity displayed in its plan. It is quite certain that the structures that now bear the name of Nectanebus (a portal and a vestibule) were not the only buildings on Phil81 under that king, for the construction of every temple, without exception, began with the sanctuary and ended with the doors. We may assume that an extensive temple stood here before its removal by the PersiaJl.s; and that the latter largely destroyed the works of their rival. The parts that were spared were then incorporated by the Ptolemaic builders, while the Romans united the work of the Lagid81 with the ancient vestibule of Nectanebus by means of the tapering peristyle court. b. The Colonnaded Court. This space is bounded on the W. side by a long wall, pierced here and there with windowB, which, based on a firm substructure on the river-bank, forma the back of a narrow, but unusually long Colonnade CPl. F; 100 yds.). The latter, built under the Romans, has a row of 31 (formerly 92) lumns, each 16 ft. high, on its E. side, and has a roof of good setted work. The colour of the hieroglyphics and representations is still remarkably vivid in various places, especially in the S. por· tion near the vestibule of N ectanebus. There appear Nero with hls cartouches, Claudius Olllsar and Germanicu8 Autocrator before Horus, Tasentllefert and Pinebtati (who also appears at OmboB, p. '261) worshipping the lord of Ombos.

The other inscriptions are of similar purport. At the S. end of the E. Colonnade (Pl. D) was a large Hall (Pl. C), of which only fragments of the N. and E. walls remain. It bears the name of Tiberius. The colonnade, which adjoins its N. wall, was never entirely completed. Only three of the capitals of the columns (including a very fine palm-capital) are finished; the rest are merely roughly blocked out, but they are of interest as showing us that the more elaborate carving was not taken in hand until after the capitals had been placed in position upon the shafts. The E. colonnade does not extend as far as the first pylons, but is separated from them by a small Temple of £3culapiu3, the tian Imhotep, son of Ptah (PI.

These, however, are by no means parallel to each other, while the edi1l.ees to the E. and W. of the peristyle are so entirely diJferent, that it ia at once apparent that the court was not constructed according to any preconceived plan. The requirements of the moment and the able space were taken into account, not any artistic tions. Nevertheless this court, entirely enclosed by buildings of the most varied forms, must be described as unusually effective. On the E. and W. are two oblong edi1l.ces, each with columns on the side next the court. That to the W. (left) is a distinct temple, forming a kind of peripteros; that to the E. was uaed by the priests. iThis court, which is mostly uneven, contains one spot cellently adapted for the pitching of a tent. Oook's parties usually lunch here; if there are more than one party at the same time, the second lunches in the kiosque (pl. R). e. The Temple to the W. of the Peristyle (pl.

290 BOIde 29. PHILM. with the concave ccimice and astragal, exhihitll an unusually ane inscription, carved in the grand Biyle, of which a duplicate occurs on the architrave of the E. colonnade opposite. This IfIICf'iption records that Ptolemy IX. Euergete8 U.Physkon (with numerous titles) and hie wife Oleopatra, princess and mistress of both worlds, the Euergetlll (divine benefactors), loved the giving Isis, the mistrest of Abaton, the queen of the Wand of Phil., \J Q E3 L1 and the mistress of the 8. lands. The king ill I (divine brothers), Euerget., "if I "if I' PhUopatorea, Epiphanes, Eupatores, and Philometores, erected and restored this beautiful monument, that it might be a festal hall for his (the king's) mother Usert-Hathor, etc., and a scene of joyful excitement, Td:h, for the mistress of . Phillll, that she might settle in it, etc. The above list of Ptolemaic surnames is especially important. At the top of the left colonnade, next the ftrst pylon, are some demotic and hieroglyphic DeCf'fIU, of the 21st year of Ptolemy phanes, one relating to the celebration of the suppression of a revolt and the punishment of the rebels, the other in honour of Cleopava, wife of Epiphanes. These inscriptions, of great scientific value though extremely lightly and almost illegibly carved, were discovered by Lepsius in 1843. Unfortunately they have been much injured by figures carved over them under Neos Dionysus. An upper story of Nile bricks, now in ruins, was built at some later period on the roof of this peripteral temple. It is entirely out of place and should be removed. f. The Building on the B. aide of the Peristyle (pl. M), tioned on p. 288, lies opposite the birth-house, and present!! a long Colonnade of 10 columns, with elaborate capitals, towards the court. In the rear-wall of this colonnade is 1lrst, to the left, a large doorway, leading through a vestibule to the outside of the temple, and then three lesser doors leading into three small bers, partly devoted to scientific purposes. At the 8. end, close to the pylon, is a fifth door, admitting to a room now half in ruins. To the left of this room is another chamber 
(Pl. 1; see below), and straight on is the Staircase (Pl. m) leading to the rooms on the upper story. Some of the latter are tolerably spacious, but ha ... e no inscriptions; whereas the lower story and the columns were adorned with hieroglyphics by Ptolemy xm. Neos DionYlAls. The tions in the various rooms are due to Tlberins, to whom Phillll in general is much indebted.

The names and the proportionate quantities (in "figures) of the drugs used in its preparation are recorded on the door-posts. The interior has no inscriptions. The other (entered by the fourth door from the pylon) is, on the other hand, very rich in inscriptions. This small room, extremely elegantly adorned with sculptures by the orders of Tiberius (here named 'Autokrator Kiares'), was the LibN'1I (pI. h) i and on the right door-post ia tbe legend: 'This is the library-room ŁŁ of tbe gracious Sa-" felb, goddess of bistory, the room for preserving the writings of the life-bestowing Isis'. The repnsentadons over the door must have been .pecially able to the Chrleli&ns, for they have all been carefully chiselled out.

To reaeh the top of the W. pylon, we ascend the staircase to the Osirill-orooml (p. 295), and then proceed leaving these on the right. The ascent of the fust pylon (p. 288) is, however, preferable in every respect. On the front of the E. wing facing the peristyle court is & circular 8t.d.e of reddish brown granite, ereoted to commemorate a lansh grant of lands, by which Ptolemy vn. Philometor (94 B.O.) enriched the temple. It was inscribed on the polished rear-wall of a monolithic chapel built into the pylon. The king, however, 88eml merely to have granted to the priests a new lease of the ancient property of the goddsi. On the pylon are some ColollfJl Figwra. To the right is King Noos Dionysus holding his enemies by the hair, before Horalisi and Hathor; beneath, smaller representations. To the left the king appears before Osiris and Isis. The grooves for the Ilag-staffs should also be noted. The Portal (Pl. p) to the temple proper, approached by a shallow llight of steps, was built by getes n. in imitation of the portal of N ectanebus in the first pylon. Within it the predecessors of the builder are recounted. The Temple of leis proper, entered by this portal, was built according to an independent plan, embracing a hypostyle, a naos with various dinsions, and a sanctuary, with two side-rooms. Ptolemy II. Philadelphus was the founder of this temple, to whose decoration the hostUe brothers Philometor and Energetes II. (Physkon) contributed most largely. It was only natural that both the weak but amiable Philometor and the vicious but energetic Physkon should interest themselves in the sanctuary of Isis, for both were much Interested In retaining Nubia. We are aware that the former maintained a military station to the 8. of Phil"', which afterwards grew into the town of Parembol4 (p. SOli). Later Ptolemies are also named here. We refrain from a closer examination of the reliefs and iDscription. in this temple, though they are not uninteresting from & mythological point of view. tenting ourselves 
with a reference to the detailed descriptions of the Ptolemaic temples at Denderah (p. 80) and Edrn (p. 2M) .. ' h. The ][ypoltyle (PI. N) contains ten columns arranged in three rows. The second and thUd rows contain each two eohunna to the right and two to the left; while the first row has ollly the two comer-columns, the space between them being left uncovered for the sake of light. The hall thus consists properly speaking of two portions: an uncovered fore-court with two doors, on the right and left, leading to the outside of the temple, and a covered part behind. The ('olumns are 241/2 ft. high and 133/, ft. in circumference. The uncovered portion could be shaded from the sun by means 01 a velarium; the holes for the cords are still nslble in the upper pari of the concave cornice turned towards the second pylon. The ing of this hall, which has been preserved on the ceiling and the columns, must have been very brilliant.

ofIlia. pmL&.· Sky-blue, light-green, and a light and a dark shade of red are the prevailing colours; but these were distributed according to conventional rules. Although vegetable forms are imitated with admirable fidelity, the artists did not shrink from colouring them with complete disregard to nature, simply becausc ancient convention demanded it. Light-green palm-twigs receive blue ribs, and blue flowers have blue, red, or yellow petals. Below the annuli on the shan is a kind of band (found also where), indicating that tbe vegetable forms surrounding the core of the capital were supposed to be firmly bound to the top of the shaft. The height and ornamentation of the lower parts of the shafts are the same in all the columns; but the capitals, some of which are beauUful capitals, are varied. On the Ceiling are astronomical representations. The entire hall bears the inscriptions of Ptolemy IX. Euergetes II.-Above the door in the back wall leading to the pronaos is a long Inscription, carved over the bieroglyphic.s by the Italian Expedition of 1841. The Christian successors of the priests of Isis have cut numerous Coptic crosses in the walls to signalize their appropriation of the temple and to guard against the cunning malice of the heathen deities. Christian services were celebrated in this hall. A Greek inscription in the doorway to the prona03, on the right, records that the good work (probably the plastering up of the reliefs and the preparation of the hall for Christian worship) took place under the abbot Theodorus. This was in the reign of Justinian. i. The Chamben of the PronaoB. The three successive rooms of the pronaos date from Ptolemy n. Philadelphus.

The doors on the right and left of this room admit to long, narrow, dark apartments, perhaps used as Treamre-Chambers. The entrance to that on the left (pl. w) is about '.1 ft. from the ground. The visitor IIhould enter, strike a light, and inspect the sculptures in this chamber which resembles a huge stone chest.

NODI, dating from Ptolemy and C!eopava.-If we quiUhe &tyle of the temple of Isis proper by the small portal in iis E. wall between the first row of columns and the second pylon, we see about 50 paces in front of us the Chapel of Hathor (Pl. Q), the smallest iIImple on th!! island. That i$ was especially dedicated to Bathor we learn from hieroglyphic insrriptions J of the time of the emperor Augustus, and 
from the Greek tion IEPTIA ETJOIHCEI'I -TH -A4>pnAEITH, 'Hienia directed (a prayer) to Aphrodite (Bathor),.+ The fact that the rear wall of this chapel has no inscriptions and the ruins behind it indicate that it was once joined to some larger ediAee; At the entrance stand two Ptolemaic columns, with a doorway between them, the side-posts of which, unconnected with each other at the top, reach to the bands below the capital.. This doorway is built up, and it is probable that the single apartment within the temple was used as a dwelling, as its walls are much blaokened. WUllin appear Ptolemy VII. Pbilometor and Euergetes II. with patra; and a180 over the entrance. On the B. side is the emperor before Hathor and Horsamtaui, and before Khnum and Hathorl; on the N. aide before Osiria and Iaia.

Bigeh enjoyed a very early reputation for peculiar sanctity, and we·have already seen (p.294) that one of the symbolical sources of the Nile was located here. Various Rock Inscriptions and also the glyphics on a granite Statue of Osiris found here record that as early as the 18th Dyn., under Amenhotep II. and Amenhotep Ill., this island was visited by pilgrims and was provided with temples. 'l'he deities chiefly worshipped in the latter were the ram's-headed Khnum, god of the cataracts, and a Hathor. Senem was not regarded &8 belonging to Egypt but to KU8h, i.e. Ethiopia, or Ta-ken8, with which the modern Kentls may be compared. Among the pilgrims, whose names are found on Bigeh, were several governors of opia, who were Ilsually royal princes. The ruins of the Temple visible from Philm, in which the name of Ptolemy Neos Dionysus is of most frequent occurrence, are now inhabited by an obliging Nubian family, only a few of whose members understand anything but Kent1s.

300 LOWER NUBIA. Hi.,ory. therefore who desire to proceed to the second cataract should stipulate in their contract (p. xxii), for a boat able to perform the entire voyage. Nubia extends from the first cataract to i.e. to N.lat. 16°, and is divided into Lower Nubia, between the first two racts, and Upper Nubia, above the second cataract. Upper Nubia, which with the Sftdan and Dbror was formerly subject to Egypt, is at present independent, and is not accessible for tourists. Lower Nubia belongs to the mudiriyeh of from which it is governed, so far as it is not under military (British) rule. It extends to about N. lat. 2.2.0. The cultivable strip, even in Lower Nubia, is seldom more than a few hundred yards wide, while it is generally much narrower, 80 that the desert approaches close up to the banks of the Nile. As a natural consequence the population is scanty j it is estimated to be not more than 40,000 between the first and second cataracts. The Nile flows for the first half of the distance between the cataracts from S. to N., for the second half from S.E. toN.W., and in Upper Nubia from N. to S. The Monuments of Lower Nubia are nearly all on the W. bank, where they were less exposed to hostile attack. The most interesting.is the temple ofAbu-Simbel, the last station before Wadi J;lalfah. The monuments in Upper Nubia are rarer but not less remarkable, as e.g. those at Gebel Barkal. History. The 1I.rst cataract forms the natural boundary of Egypt.

In hiB reign, according to the somewhat incredible story of Herodoma (II, 30), 'MO,OOO soldiers, discontented with the severity of their service, emigrated to Ethiopia, where they settled near Meroe under the name of Automoles or Sembrites, and did mnch to reftne the ners of the Ethiopians. Psammetikh II. undertook an expedition against the Ethiopians (Herod. ll, 160), to which references are made in Greek and Phoenician inscriptions in the temple of Simbel (p. 8M). The steles at Barkal mention two other Ethiopian kings, Bor-ai-ate' and NlUt08mtn, "hose reigns ca.nnot be rately dated. The former reigned for forty years, warred against the Re1&re'M and Madia, Africa.n tribes of DartAr and Abyssinia, a.nd erected temples j of the latter we learn that he was solemnly crowned in the temple of Napata. The early royal residence Napata now bega.n to decay, and B_ (Meroe) near Begerawiyeh became the capital of the pia.ns. From Diod0ftA8 (Ill, 6) we learn that under Ptolemy delphus a king of the name of Ergamme, shook himself free of the influence of the pries" a.nd caused them to be manacrad in the golden temple. This can hardly be the same Ergamenes whom we meet at Dakkeb (p. 816), for the latter does not seem to have flourished until the time of the Roman emperors. During the B0-man period, an Ethiopian invasion of the Thebaid led to the paign of Petronius (25 B.C.), in which Napata was destroyed. Queen Candace made peace with the Roman general (Strabo XVII, 04.). Towards the close of the 3rd cent. A.D. the country above PhUI8 was devastated by the BlemmYe8, a llerce Nubian tribe dwelling between the Nile and the Red Sea, who carried their depredations even into the Roman territory beyond Aasuan. To restr&in them the emperor Diocletian summoned the tribe of the No"ade. from the oasis 01 el-Khargeh (p. 348) to the Nile valley, and settled them in the district from Elephantine upwards, while the temples of Phill8 were assigned as common 8a.nctuaries to them a.nd to the Blemmyes. In spite of the aid of the Nobades, the flve towns of the Commilmum Romanum (prima, Phomicon, Khiris, Taphts, and Talmis) fen into the hands of the barbarians, who made Talmis (I}alabsheh, see p. 307) their capital. In the 4th and 5th cent. they ravaged the Thebaid, 80 that in 461' A.D. MaziminuB, the general of the emperor Marcian, was forced to conclude a peace on unfavonrable terms for 100 years, which, however, only lasted until the death of the general. Between li30 and liliO the Nobades were converted to Christianity j and Bilko, one of their kings, defeated the Blemmyes.

This, however, was of no long duration. Dongolah was frequently invaded by the robber tribe of the BMgiyeh. -lIma1l PaaM, son of made himself muter of all these provinces in 182.1. He conquered Dongolah out opposition, defeated the Sht1giyeh at Korti, and acquired Sennb also. This conquest, however, cost Isma'U his Hfe. At a festival given by him at Shendi, a hut in which he had been secured was set on ftre, and he and his companions perished in the llames. But this incident did not prevent the complete subjugation of the Sudan, which was converted into an Egyptian province, with the founded Khal1ftm as its capital. DarfUr, too, was conquered and annexed in 1874. But the war with AbY88inia (1870-76), a revolt in DarfUr, the rotten state of the Egyptian llnances, the rebellion of Arabi Pasha, the victorious advance of the Mahdi, and the death of the devoted General Gordon (Jan. 1881» led to the loss of all the Egyptian posseSsions to the S. ofW&di ijalfah, in spite of the British occupation of Egypt (1882.) and the belated expeditions to Dongolah and to Khartftm (18fM-86).

The extant Laf"ge TemJlu was built under the Roman emperor Augustus and his successors. The numerous inScriptions (in Greek, with the exception of one in Latin hexameters) date from the reigns of DOmitian, Trajan, Hadrian, and Antoninus Pius, and ot the later emperors Alexander Severus and PhUippus; they express the rence of the soldiers of the Spanish, Iturean, and Theban cohorts for the great god ManduliB. Including the inner girdle-wall the temple is '230 it. long and 1171/2 ft. broad. There is also an outer girdle-wall, with small temples at the N.E. and S.W. angles. Before the last stand 1lTe columns one behind the other. The inner girdle-wall joins the massive pylon, forming a eontinuous building with it. In tront of the pylon is a narrow platform, reached by a 1light of steps ning at the Nile, then by a paved passage about 100 ft. long and 20 ft. broad, leading to a second tlight of '20 steps. The entrance toO the temple ia blocked by fallen stones and the dwellings of natives, who have settled all about the entire temple. In the interior of the pylon are stairs and chambers, as at Edfu (p. '244). On paasing through the door of the pylon, which is not in a straight line with the rest of the building but at a slight angle with the axis of the temple, we tlnd ourselves in a fore-court, 66 ft. long, the iloor of which is quite covered with fallen blocks of masonry Ł. Of the double row of columns which once stood here, probably in 4, couples on each side, only a single column, on the left side, is now ereet. On each side of this court four narrow chambers have been constructed in the wall j and a door on the right communicates with the exterior passage round the temple. The walls of the entrance to the next room retire towards the top in the manner of a pylon. Here on the right the above-mentioned decree /)f Bilko is inscribed in bad Greek. On the nearest column is a long inscription in the Ethiopian tic character, hitherto undeciphered, which may perhaps be a replica or repetition of the decree. The English translation of BUko's Important Greek Inscription i. all follows. 'I, Bllko, eub-king (au,Alcntoc) oUbe Nobades and all Ethiopians, came twice to Talmis (Kalabsbeb) and Tapbl. (Tafeb).

For whosoever raise themselves against me, them I deprive of their wives and children'. On the pillar between the two columns to the right of the trance to the main temple is another Greek inscription. This is a decree of Aurelius Besmon, also named Amonius, military governor of Ombos and Elephantine, ordering the owners of swine to remove their animals from the holy Talmis. It probably dates from the year 248-9 A.D. -On the left side of the elegant entrance-door c-:::J . appears the Pharaoh (probably Augustus), over whom Thoth <>c:::> and Horus hut (or be1Jat) pour the' symbols ot a peaceful life f 1.

Leaving now the entrauce-wall with its four columns behind us, we find ourselves in the main building of the temple,· the portico proper, which is 40 ft. deep and 66 ft. broad. This portico is siderably higher than the three rooms behind it, from which a double staircase ascends to the roof (now fallen) of the portico. It has four, or including those of the entrance wall six, elegant lumnson each side, with varying capitals. Only two, on the left, are now standing in the interior. On the E. wall the emperor pears sacrificing to the gods of Talmis, and adjoining this scene is the above-mentioned relief of Amenhotep II. presenting wine and milk to -The next three rooms are small (171/2 ft. deep and 40 ft. wide), and have sacrificial scenes on their walls. Each probably contained two columns, those in the second room being still preserved. The staircase to the roof ascended to the left from the :Orst room. On the outside of the W. back-wall of the temple are various well-preserved representations, including the dess Isis with Ptolemy Caesarion, son of Julius Caesar and Cleopatra. The temple, like that of EMu, is surrounded by a passage, ing towards the rear and entered from the fore-court by doors on both sides j and, as mentioned above, there is also a secoud and wider passage outside the 1Irst one, with whieh it communieation by means of a door on the left side. This outer passage could be closed by means of doors. The whole strueture is a faithful reproduction of an early Egyptian temple, but dates from Roman times. The little *Temple of Bit el-Walli, situated upon a hill about 20 min. to the N., is much more noteworthy than the large Roman erection at J}alabsheh. The way to it leads along the verge of the mountain, level at first, but finally ascends steeply. The temple consists of a vestibule, of which only the side walls are now ing, a main chamber, entered by a central and two side doors, and a small adytum, adjoining the latter. In the vestibule our interest is excited by the warlike scenes on the side-walls. Thjl8.e indi,cate " DigitIZed by\..:.oogle

Gau's theory that there was formerly another edillce to the right, almost as large as the present one to the left, seems insufficiently supported, though suggested by existing remains. The present temple was built by the native king Ergamenes (the inner temple 0, compo PI. p. S17), Ptolemy IV. Philopator (Sekos B), and lemy IX. Euergetes II.

On the W. bank, opposite a dark mountain-peak, lies the Temple of Ofedfnah, also called Templll of Ma{lara{cah, after the village of ]ll[al],ara\tah, which lies a little bigber up on the E. bank. Dating from tbe Roman period, its Greek and demotic inscriptions show it to bave been dedicated to Seraph and Isis. It consisted of an trance-ball (now destroyed) approached by a broad llight of 14 steps, and of a main colonnaded building, 40 ft. long and 50 ft. broad. Part of the walls has fallen; but 3 columns to the right and 2 to the left of tbe entrance still stand, besides 8 columns in the interior. In tbe innermost corner, to the right, are traces of a staircase leading to the roof. A wall connects tbis temple with a smaller square structure to the E., on whicb is a curious representation: beneath a llg-tree whence the Greek name of the place, which was perhaps named Penuba in early Egyptian quity) sits a goddess with cow's horns (Isia-Hathor), before whom is a boy with a jug in his hands; above are three other gods.

TEMPLE OF SEB&AH. 32. Boute. 323 few without heads lie behind. Beside the two 1lrst are two colossal statnes of Ramses n., 101/2 ft. high, placed against pillars, bearing the cartouches of the king, 'beloved of Harmachis and Ptah' on the right, and 'beloved of Ammon-Ra and Ptah', on the left. The king's name appears on the girdles of both ftgures and on the chests of the sphinxes. Statues of the king, probably four in number (now destroyed), also stood in front of the pylon, which is 32 ft. high and 42 ft. broad. On the back of one of these statues it Is recorded that the king erected .this noble pillar in Pa-Amon (apparently the holy name of the temple) in memory of his father Ammon-Ra and adorned it with costly gems. On the outside of the pylon, as in various other Egyptian temples, are two colossal figures, which, however, are dlfftcult to identify Owing to the weatherworn state of the sandstone, of which the temple is built. On the right the king holds eight foes by the hair, menacing them with his weapon while they raise their hands in suppIice.tion: 'he smites the great ones of all lands'. The god Harmachis hands him the sword of victory. To the left is a similar scene, in presence of Ammon-Ra, who promises to the king victory over all alien lands. The large fore-court, which we now enter, is 65 ft. square. The interior 'is very interesting. To the right and left are corridors, each with 5 Osiris-pillars supporting an architrave. On the left (S.) side the roof of slabs is still extant, but on the N. side it Is wanting, so that the drift-sand has found entrance and now covers a considerable portion of the court. At the top of the back of the pylon occur the varying cartouches of Ramses II., and beneath the cornice his name occurs again, in anaglyphic characters. On the left (S.) wing of the pylon, the king presents a sphinx to Ammon-Ra and Muth, to the right he offers bread to Harmachis and Jusas. Round the court in the row nearest the ground appears a procession of the children of the king, each with the name appended, the sons bearing fans the daughters bearing sistra ,. There are two series, both ginning on the W. or back-wall of the court and running respectively to the right and left from the W. entrance to the main temple. On the W. wall, to the right of the temple-door, are 19 men (mostly concealed by the sand), on the N. wall 40 men and 8 women, and on the E. wall, to the N. of the entrance to the court 27 women, i.e. in this series 69 sons and 36 daughters. On the W. wall to the left of the temple-door are 19 men and 20 women, on the S. wall 33 men and 12 women, i.e. 52 sons and 32 daughters. If the n"ames are not repeated, as at Medinet Habu, Abydos, ete., 111 sons and 67 daughters are thus attributed to Ramses the Great. -The following room is the ftrst in the rook-hewn portion of the temple.

The following narrow room is joined by two side-ehambers and three other chambers in the bact-waD. In this room appears Ramses n. worshipping and senting offerings to various deities. Under a canopy afe tour gods. The foremost is Ptah, bare-headed and in his usual mnmmy-form, with 1 f and n· Be is named the Ptah of KiRg Bamaes m amon. Then, as at Dakkeh, follows the seated figure of a second Ptah, wearing as a headdress the buH's horns with two feathers between This Ptab is described as 'lofty with the two feathers and the horns'. Next is a female figure with the moon-disc (perhaps Bat-tati), and finally comes Bathor, goddess of the southern Nehet (sycamore tree), with horns turned upwards enclosing two feathers and the sun-disc. The colouring of the sacrillcial scenes in the side-chambers is well-preserved; and this is still more the case in the adytum, the central of the three chambers at the back. Both to the right and left in this room the king is represented sacriftcing before a richly adorned dhahabiyeh. The dhahabiyeh on the right has the hawk's head of Bar mach is as its emblem, that on the left the ram's head of Khnum-Ra. Both stand on ornamented tables. On the left the king is offering incense above an altar, on the right he is ing Ilowers. A large fan is borne beside him, and behind are dards with the heads of the two gods and of the king. -The tral picture exhibits Khnum-Ra seated in a boat beneath a canopy, with the kneeling king to the left and three cynocephali to the right. Beneath is a recess, in which the outlines of three gods may still be made out, although a figure of St. Peter, with a halo und a large key, has been painted over them. The king, who appears on the right and left, with Ilowers, has now the appearance of offering them to the saint. Beneath is an inscription, running both to the right and to the left and extending on to the side walls: 'The living Hor-Ra, the strong, the beloved of Ma, lord of the festivals, like his father Ptah, king of both lands, Ramses the Great, he has made it in memory of his father Ammon-Ra, king of the gods'.

Until a few yeats ago was the eMef emporium and port of shipment for the caravans crossing the desert to or from Abu l!amed, which lies 8-10 long days' journey distant (see belOW). This road avoided the three upper eataracts, which are not navigable when the river is low, and it also shortened the journey considerably by cutting olI the windings of the Nile. Russegger, Lepsius, and finally Gordon (1884) selected it on their way to Khartftm. A short excursion along this desert-route, between the hills, black with iron-scale, is not uninteresting; or the traveller may ascend (112 hr.; steep and stony) the hill of Awas el--Guarllni, close to On the summit is the tomb of the saint to whom the hill owes its name, a frequented pilgrim-resort. The view extends over the Nile valley as far as Den. A fort has recently been erected by the tish at Korusko. On the bank of the river is a colIee-house. The desert, route from Xorusko to (227l11.) Abu J.lamed aud Berber is described in Lepsius's Letters from Egypt and Ethiopia (see p. xxv). From Abu J.lamed to Berber tbe hire of camels was formerly 6(j piasters each, afterwards increased to 80 and 90 p. Among the stages on tbis route are e/·Bab, a range of sandstone hills extending for two days' journey; ""alI mall with its greenish flne·grained rocks continuing the preceding I Ba(n' and Wadi Delalo, where dum-palms are found. The route intersects the Gebel Botl by means of tbe wadi e.·8q{.·, witb a few rubber and and then the Gebel 8enellat by means of the W4dl lIIfiral. The last, the half-way point, contains some brackish water, the only water met witb on tbe entire route, and a few huts. Next follows the wide plain of el-Mtlnderall, bounded by the lofty hills of Abu 8iJ!a1I, tben the stony hills of Ad .... Autb, and the bonndless plain of Adererad, which extends to Abu J.lamed, with the low Gebel Farlll on the left and the Gebel MoiraA on the right. Mirages, called by the Arabs Bah,. 8nllitan or 'waters of Satan" are frequently seen on the way. Abu Hamed on the Nile is reached on the 8th, Or at latest ou the 10th day. . A little beyond the Nile valley trends totheN.W., so that the N. wind which prevails in winter frequently retards navigation. On the left bank rises a picturesque chain of hills. In this reach vellers have a chance of seeing crocodiles, which frequent the banks and lay their eggs in the clefts of the shore-. Recently, ever, they have become somewhat rare. On the W. bank the inconspicuous Temple of'Amlldak, 8 M. from comes in sight. It lies deeply sunk in the desert-sand, while on the opposite bank a eultivated strip with many trees stretches between the river and the hills. Passengers by Cook's steamers have an opportunity of visiting tbis temple. The Temple or 'AmUah has a very unpretending exterior and seems at first hardly worthy of a visit. Yet it is in reality of great interest both for scientific and ordinary travellers as an excellent ample of the graceful and elegant architecture of the 18th Dyn., der which it was built. Nothing is left of the front of the hall except the doorway; and the structure of Nile bricks adjoining the latter indicates that the temple has been used a8 a mosque or as the tomb ofa saint.

On the inside of the doorway is the name of Seti I. (19th Dyn.). Also in the doorway appears the praying figure of Betau, royal prince of Kush, who according to the royal cartouche above, served under Ramses II. The Antechamber itself consists of three rows of pillars, arranged in three couples on each side, and behind is a row of proto-Doric (p. 12) columns. The side-pillars on the right and left are connected with the side-walls. Most of the pillars exhibit the cartouches of Tutmes IV., distinguished from that of Tutmes m. by the three strokes signifying the plural. On the first engaged pillar to the left Tutmes IV. is mentioned as 'beloved by Ra kha kau (0 s UllJ U), Usertesen III., lord of Sekhem', a king of the 12th Dynasty. On the outer and inner sides of the two traves over the central pillars are dedication-inscriptions by mes IV. On the N. side of the architrave on the right, we read: 'The living good god of the Vnma (genuine), who defeated Ethiopia, brought the boundaries like him who was not created (ptah), a brave king with his sword, like Mentu, of a steady heart above many, he makes the mountains quake'. On the S. side of the left architrave are the words: 'Thoth, lord of divine words, speaks to the great cycle of gods in Pa Ra (probably the home of the gods): Come, behold the great and holy monument, carefully hewn, the divine temple of millions of years, made by King Ra-men-kheperu mes IV.) for his father Ra-tum, the great god, who made him'. The inscriptions on the oiher architraves are similar. On the two lumns to the left are the names of Tutmes m. and Amenhotep II., so that the columns seem to be older than the pillars and architrave. The Beko8 beyond the antechamber, is broad but shallow (241/2 ft. by 61/2l. On the outside of the doorway here also Amenhotep II. is commemorated; on the inside Seti I. is named a8 the restorer (r sma) of this momiment meant for Ra and Harmachis; and over the door on the inside, Tutmes III. To the right on the inside of the entrance-wall is Tutmes m. braced by Isis, and then Amenhotep II. offering drink-offerings to Ammon-Ra.

to 32. Boute. 327 dedicated to these two deities, as is also indicated by the tations to the right and left of the entrance-door. Above the small door on the right are the dedications of Tutmes m. and tep II. The three apartments contained scenes of worship, scenes from the founding of the tempi e,and sacriftcialscenes. The traveller should notice the carefully executed portraits of the three kings who took part in the erection of the temple, Tutmes m., Amenhotep 11., and Tutmes IV. On the back-wall of the sanctuary is a stele of great historical importance. At the top is a relief of Amenhotep II. presenting two vessels of wine to Harmachis and Ammon-Ra; beneath is an scription of 20 lines, from the 3rd year of the reign of tep II. After a flattering account of the king and his achievements (repeated on a stele found at Erment and now in Vienna), the completion of the temple begun by Tutmes 111. is mentioned. Line 12. 'Behold the king adorned the house of the god (which had been erected by) his father, King Tutmes III., for all the divine fathers, built of stone. as an enduring work, with a protecting wall of bricks around it. The doors were of the linest acacia·wood, the gateways of enduring stone, with the object of commemorating for ever the great name of his father Tntmes III. in this temple. King Amenhotep II. celebrated the feallval of the laying of the foundation-stone in honour of all his cestors, while he dedicated to him a massive gate-tower of hard stone in front of the protecting-wall of this splendid dwelling of the gods, a lonnade round it of hard stone as II lasting work, many aacriflcial vessel. and utensils of silver and brass, stands, altars, a bronze caldron, sie rs, dishes, and censers. Thereupon the king caused this stele to be prepared and placed in this temple in the place where (stands) the statue of the great Horns, the king, and he caused to be graven on it the mighty name of Amenhotep II. in the house of Ibis divine fathers, after he returned from the land of Upper Syria, where he overthrew all his adversaries, in order to widen the boundaries of Egypt on his first compaign. Still more remarkable is the narrative at the end of this scription: 'The king had returned home, with his heart full of gratitude to his father Ammon. With his own haud he had struck down with his club seven kings, who were in the region of the land of Takhis. They lay pinioned on the fore-deck of the royal ship, the name of which was 'Ship of Amenhotep II., maintainer of the land'. Six of these enemies were hanged on the walls of Thebes, and their hands the same. The remaining enemy was carried up the stream to Nubia, and hanged on the walls of the town of Napa/a, in order to make the victory of the king manifest for ever among all the tribes of the land of the negroes, since he has taken possession of the tribes of the S., and tamed the tribes of the N., even to the ends of the whole earth, upon which the sun shines, without finding any opposition, according to the command of his father Ra, lord of the throne of both lands. Such things has King Amenho-tap n. done" From BrtJ,.ch, History of Egypt, pp. 890, 891. Those who ascend to the roof of the temple will ftnd a memorial of Rerodotu, the 'father of history', not, however, inscribed by himself, for he himself informs us (11.29) that he came no farther than Elephantine. The worn aspect of the letters indicates that the inscription (as follows) is of considerable antiquity. DigitIZed by Coogle

The top of the hill commands an attractive view olthe town and the Nile. Near its foot lies the small and unfortunately much injured Rock Temple of Derr. The vestibule, the sides of which were formed by the smoothed rocks of the hill, and which was 4'},1/2 ft. deep by 46 ft. broad in the open air, contained a triple row of pillars, of which the hindmost alone is stsnding. This row has Osiris-ftgures lIogainst the pillars (as at Medinet-Habu, p. 175, etc.). The two front rows and the gateway are now represented only by fragments a few feet in height. On the back of the left side of the gateway are some traces ot a warlike scene, with chariots .and warriors. . The right side-wall of the vestibule was covered with warlike representations, now much damaged, in three rows. In the topmost row only the legs of the figures are now left. In the second row Ramses II., founder of this temple, can be distinguished in his chariot accompanied by a lion, before a group of prisoners. The lowes( row showed the king launching arrows against his tieeing foes. We see the fugitives veying their wounded to the mountains, where a herdsman's family, surrounded by their domestic animals, wait in grief and anxiety for their son. On the left wall also are remains of three scenes., ing one in which the king leads two rows of captives to Harmaehis, The third row of pillars, hewn out of the rock and still standing, bore dedications from the king to various gods. The representations on the back wall of this hall, to the right and left of the entrance into the dark excavated part of the temple (lights necessary), are specially effective. . On the right side the king holds by the hair some foes, bending in presence of Ammon-Ra, while between the king's legs is his lion, here said to follow the king and to alay his enemies. The heads of the king and the god are unfortunately destroyed. To the left of this scene are two smaller ones showing the king before Ptah and (Sekhet) before Thoth, Beneath is a row of the king'a daughters with sistra, corresponding to a row of his sons, with fans, headed by Amenhikhopuhf, on the left wall. The ohlef scene on the left wall, above the king's sons, shows the king fighting agat1l1lt hi. foea in presence of the hawk-headed Harmaehis, with the lion biting the leg of one of the foes.

The trave above the pillars contains the customary tion. On the right we read: 'The living Hor-Ra, the strong lord of both lands beloved by Ma, who rules Egypt and has conquered the nations, the gold-hawk, rich in years, great in victories, the king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Ramses II., has reared in memory of his father Harmachis the Hat Bame88u meramon in Pa Ba. 'Pa Ra' is thus the holy name of the spot and 'temple of Ramses mon' the name of the sanctuary. On the left architrave Ammon-Ra is mentioned instead of Harmachis, as lord of the throne of both lands, so that the temple must be regardeli as dedicated to both deities. On the six pillars are ftgures of the king befor.e 'rum, Ptah, Khnum, and other gods. On the right side-wall is the boat machis borne by 12 priests and conducted by the king; on the left side-wall the king, in 1\ boat,offering incense. From this chamber a large door, surmounted by the winged sun-disc, leads into the sanctuary, and doors to the right and left admit to smaller ments. Four seated ftgures occupy the rear-wall of the sanctuary, viz. (beginning to the left) Ptah, Ammon-Ra, the king, and machis with the hawk'. head. They are all represented full face, and would be difftcult to identify were it not for the inscriptions adjoining. -Not far from the temple is a small rock-stele, cated to the king's son Amenemheb, with the ftgure of a temple. Beyond Den the Nile valley again turns to the S.W. To the right is the island of Tomas. Crocodiles now become more ous, looking from a distance like tree-trunks or like huge frogs. A nearer view is only to be obtained by rowing on ahead of the biyeh in the felukeh or small boat. At Ellesiyeh (E. bank), also called ed-Duknesrah, is a rock-tomb of the 18th Dynasty. On a stele here, dating from the 481'd year of Tutmes m., the king presents offerings to Horus, lord of Mum 1 , and to Sati, mistress of Abu. The wall-paintings represent the king seated between Muth and Uaz; then offering to Horus, lord of the land of Khent, to Horus of Mam, and to Thoth and Ilathor. On the W. bank, opposite I{etteh, we next see an ancient ruined fort. Then to the right is the verdant island of Abu Bas, and to the left the village of -18 M. Ibrlm. To the E. rises a comiderable chain of hills, and to the W. (left) is a narrow strip of palms and castor-oil plants, beyond wbich is the desert.

On the E. part of the S. wall is inscribed a record of the presentation of lands for the maintenance of the statues of the king in the town of 1 Emiid, which was apparently.the name of this place or of 'Amadah. On the E. wall is a royal prince of Kush, standing, fan in hand, before Ramses VI., and announcing to him the gift of Pan" .. f, who presented the adjacent statues of the king and two silver anointing-vessels. In the lower row, Pennut and Ta Kha, his wife, the singer of Ammon, present an offering before their deceased relations, the men being represented above, the women below. These family scenes are continued on the E. part of the N. Wall; above is the worship of Harmachis, below that of Osiris. On the W. part of the N. wall and continued on the W. wall and half of the S. wall are scenes relating to the worship of the dead. Pennut appears on his knees before a mountain, from whieh the head of Hathor, a goddess of the under-world, projects among lotus -dowers. Within the mountain is a chapel with a tapering roof, aud in front of the mountain is the goddess Ape, holding a frog in her hand. On the W. wall is the preparation of the mummy of the deceased, and the sentation of the deceased and his wife to Osiris, by Horus, son of Isis. Beneath, the fields of .Aalura are being tilled I and Harmachis, Tum, and Khepera, seated upon a pedestal, are receiving homage. On the W. half of the S. wall are the balances of the dead, the entranee to the grave, and the laying of the deceased in the vault by a long train of mourning relations. A little above Anibeh (p. 329) a fiat-topped hill of some size rises steeply from the Nile on the E. Upon this stands the partly ruined fort of :JI:a.!r Ibrim, dating from Roman times. A visit to it is interesting. The ascent is made on the N. At the top are some blocks with the name of Taharka of the 25th Dyn., and a basilica with Byzantine capitals of granite. lbrim is identified with the Roman Primi' Pcwva or Premis, a fortress stormed by Petronius (p. 302), who afterwards restored it and garrisoned it with 400 men, with provisions for two years. At the beginning of the 16th cent. the sultan SeUm placed a garrison of Bosniana here, whose dants were defeated in 1811 by the fieeing Mamelukes. Finally Ibrahtm Pasha captured the fortress. In the S. slope of the mountain, not far above the river-bank, are llve grottoes hewn in the rock, all of which except the most northerly, bear inscriptions. The llrst (on the S.) shows over the entrance the cartouches of Tutmes Ill., 'beloved by Horus, lord of Mam 1 and by Sati, mistress 'of the land of KMnt'. This grotto belonged to Nthi, overseer of the palace and royal Bon (probably only a title), and overseer of the S.land. Beside a much damaged relief ofNehi presenting booty or tribute from the S.land to the king, is the inscription: 'Bringing of the tribute of the S. lands in gold, Ivory, and ebony, by the gracious overseer, the privy councillor .ŁŁŁ. , the royal son, and president of the S. land ...

ABU-SIMBEL. 38. Boute. 331 Nebi'. In the recess at the end of the eave TutmeslII. sits between Horus and Sati. Immediately to the left is the second cave (about 10 ft. deep), much less skilfully executed, in which appear ten persons before Ramses. Among these are Setau, prince of Kush (whose name is found elsewhere in NUbia), and a number of scribes and officials. The third eave, which lies a little higher up, also shows the cartouche of Tutmes III. The recess contains the somewhat roughly executed figures of four seated personages; to the right the king and Sati, to the left the king and Horus, lord ofMam.-The fourth cave (from the S.) is the most important. It belongs to hotep II., who appears conducted by Horus, lord of Beheni, to a row of gods including Khnum, Sati, and Anuke, the gods of the cataracts, and Horus, Hathor, and Heben. -To the S. of lbrim a few steles are found, one showing a victorious king in his war-chariot. The mountains presently retire, leaving room for a strip of vated land. Numerous or water-wheels are seen. To the left (E.) appears the village of Djimeneh, beside a pretty wood. Farther on, on the same bank, lies (NUbian 'Three tains'), a small place among palms, with a somewhat uncivilized population. At et-Gharb, on the W. bank, 7 M. from the river, a large force of dervishes was defeated with the loss of their cannon by the British on Aug. 3rd 1889; several thousand slain were left on the battle-field, and their weapons and clothing were sold by the neighbouring natives. Cook's tourists may visit the battIe-fleld if they desire it. The district we next enter upon is very monotonous and almost uninhabited; and navigation is rendered difficult by rocks. 1'0 the left lie Gurguntli and three shekhs' tombs; then the villages of Debut and Feraig. The river-bed becomes very wide at places. On the right we catch sight of the colossi that guard the temple of Simbel. 331/2 M. Abu-Simbet, on the W. bank. 85. The Rock-Temples of Abu-Simbel. Cook's tourist-steamers usually reach Abu·Simbel in the evening of the third day, in time to permit of a visit to the temples before night. Next morning they proceed to Wildi J;lalfah. On the return-voyage they again spend the night at Abu -Simbel, starting next morning at 9 or 10 o·clock.

Temple. ABU-BIMBEL. 33. 333 106 ft., in order to form the imposing of this temple. At the top we see a row of 22 cynocephali (some destroyed), which we learn from other Egyptian temples to recognize as shippers of the sun-god. Below these are the cartouches of the king, surrounded with Urmus-serpents. Then follows the short dication inscription of Ramses the Great, which begins in the middle and runs in both directions; on the right it styles the king 'beloved by Harmachis', on the left 'beloved by Ammon, king of the gods' Ł. Still lower , in a recess in the centre of the temple-wall, is a full-relief statue of Horus (Harmachis), with the sun on his head. and the symbols of life in his hands, while below, to the right, is the goddess Ma, to the left the symbol 1 uaer, thus expressing the king's name in picture-writing. To the right and left is the king again, presenting figures which also express his name, and shipping the god. Below, and somewhat indistinct, are the double cartouches of the king. Our attention is most forcibly attraoted to the four seated Cmos" (pl. a, b, 0, d), hewn out of the rock, with their backs against the cliff. That to the left of the entrance (pl. b) has unfortunately been violently deprived of its head and arms', which now lie on the ground in front. The colossus on the other side of the door (pl. c) was restored by Beti II. Each of those figures is not less than 66 ft. high, their varioull limbs being in proportion. In spite of the mous scale the general effect is successful, and the countenances have a pleasant and intelligent expression. All four represent Ramses the Great, as is testified by the cattouehes on the breast and arms and between the legs. To the right and left of each are standing figures, mostly of women; to the right and left of the trance, Noferlari Merl-en-mu', consort of Ramses; between the legs of the injured colossus, prince Amenhikhopuhf ('Ammon in his sword'), who is introduced in the temple of Derr as the oldest son (aemes) of Ramses II.; to the left of this colossus Tull, the king's mother. Beside the colossus farthest to the left are two daughters of the king, viz. Nebt-tati, on the left, and on the right; between the legs is an unnamed female figure. The figures at the aides of the oolossus to the extreme right, the names of which are concealed by the sand, probably correspond to these. In 1817 zoni spent 14 days in freeing the temple from the sand that had drifted into it from the desert ·behind. Burckhardt, however, had .mentioned it previously. It was again laid bare by Lepsius in 1844 and by Mariette in 1869, but the sand has already covered great part of it to a considerable depth. l3etore we enter the temple Our attentiou fa claimed by a Greek soriptlon which Is found on the letlleg of the lujured colossus, along with varlQus other Greek, Carian, and Phrenician Inscriptions.

Tbe writers of the other Greek tions were partly Ionians from Teos and Kolopbon, partiy Doriana from Rhodes, a Sidonian, and a Carlan. Providing ourselves with candles, or still better with a nesium lamp, we now enter the rock-temple, the interior of which, with its still vividly coloured pictorial decorations, is no les8 markable than the exterior. The walls of the first hall (pl. F), which is 08 ft. long by 54 ft. broad, are covered all round with presentations, which were first chiselled in the stone, then covered with a' thin coating of stucco and painted. The ceiling is supported by eight square pillars, against which stand Osiris -figures of the king, with the scourge and the crook in his crossed hands. The ceiling itself is adorned with vultures and the names of the king. Above the entrance is the remarkably simple dedication-inscription, on the right to Harmacbis, lord of the land of Khent, on the left to Ammon-Ra, king of the gods. The pictorial scenes in this hall are symmetrically arranged, so that those referring to events in the N. of Egypt are placed on the N. (right) side, those to events in the S., on the S. (left) side. A similar arrangement was adopted in the exterior hall of the temple of el-Walli (p. 310). On each side of the entrance-wall within are reprasentations, such as are commonly found on the pylons of more recent temples; as f.g. at Edfu and PhillB. The king aims a blow with his club at a number of foes, whom he holds by the hair, while they raise their hands in supplication. On the left are represented N. tribes, on the right S. tribes, easily distinguished by their facial istics. Harmaebis stands before the king on the left, and Ammon, handing him the sword of victory, on the right. Hovering above the king is a protecting vulture. On a stancfard behind him is the name Ka mkht met"i ma, 'the strong bull, beloved of the goddeas Ma'.

The llrst represents the king in his chariot at the storm of a fortress. The horses with handsome harness are galloping, while the king launches an arrow against the fortress. Above him is the guardian vulture, and behind him are his three sons Bamles, and Bahiuaflem'f, with their bearers in chariots. The defenders of the well-drawn fortress are pierced by arrows; one is falling from the walls. A herdsman takes to lligbt with hiB herd. Beside the king's horses are the words, referring to the king: 'The good god, son of Ammon, the advanCing lord of the sword, protector of his soldiers, shield of the fighters, bravely knowing the plaee of his hand, lIrm in his war-chariot like the lord of Thebes, a lord of victory he slays hundreds of thousands, one bull against numberless (foes), he sweel.'s away the confederates, he defeats the rebels on the summit of thelr mountains, he penetrates into their valleys like the grasshoppers. Thou eausest them to be cut 011' in their dwellings. Thou destroyest their seed with the royal sickle'. A second picture exhibits the king on foot, treading upon a prostrate enemy, and piercing a Syrian with a lance so that bis blood gushes forth. The king is represented as a young man of vigorous frame, probably as at the beginning of his warlike career. The inscription runs: 'The good god who breaks in pieces the nine tribes of the bow, who exterminates the lands of the N., a strong hero against the nations, with a brave sword like Mentu. He leads the land of the negroes to the N. land, the Amu to the land of Khent (Nubia). He transplants. the people of the Shasu to the land of ... , he plaees the land of Tehen at the mountain-ridge. He 1I11s with his victories the temples that he has built with the booty which he won when he overthrew the land of Syria, and annihilated the land of Retennu, thrown down upon its back'. The third picture exhibits the triumphal return of the king from battle, His cbariot is preceded by two rows of fettered tives -black and brown people from the S. (i.e. Nubians and St1-danese) -clad in skins and wearing caps of straw or reeds. The king follows calmly in his chariot; his horse, named Nekhtu em WaB (Victorious in Thebes), paces proudly along; and beneath the horse is the king's lion, which bim in battle. The inscription is as follows: The living and good god, who tames the rebellioust smites the land of the S., and annihilates the land of the N. A brave king with his sword he drives far back those who have crossed his borders. His maJesty comes to (distant) lands, he places many in terror'. Farther on we read 'He slays their chiefs, he eauses the groes of Wawa to say 'he is like a flame in its uprising, he (spares) not the Retennu'. A large picture on the opposite (N, wall) deals witb the warlike events connected with the storming of the fortress of Kate.h, on the Orontas (Aranuta), with which we have already become acquainted in the Ramesseum (p. 161), and at Luxor, Karnak, and Abyd08.

Many of Ibe enemy, bolh Kheta and Libyans, have fallen into the water. To the extreme right, above the blue-painted river, is Ibe king In hi. chariot, addressing gracious words to his officers, who count the severed huds and limb, of Ibe Kheta and Nabarina before him and bring feltered prisoners. A narrow strip below represents the chariot -fight. Beneath, to the left, Is the stockaded camp, into which, according to the adjOining Inscription, the enemy forced their way bnt were repulsed by the single legion of Ammon, commanded by the king, who had been lulled into security by the false reports of two spies, and had despatched several of his regiments in another direcUon. In Ibe piclure to the right the king sits upon his throne, among his courtiers. To the right and left of Ibe royal person is the account of an event in the 6th year of his reign, already known to us from Ibe Ramesseum (p. 161). It relates that two Arabs (Shuu) tered the Egyptian camp, pretending to be refugees from the Kheta, and seeking service under the Pharaoh. They stated that the Kheta lay al Khirabu (Helbon i.e. Aleppo) to the N. of Thunep, and were in terror of the Egyptians. This information was false, and the two sl?ies were flogged (in the lowest scene to the right), in order, as the inscrlption says, that Ibey might say where Ibe miserable Kheta lurked. The spies were next brought before the king On his golden throne, and cross-examined, and finally confessed Ibat the Kheta, with numerous allies, lay behind Katesh. The king assembles his generals, relates what the spies have told, chides his ofllers for belng.o imperfectly informed, and orders the recall of the troops that had been sent elsewhere. He himself puts on his armour, IIltacks the enemy, slays them, and throws them into the river. Two pictures on the back (W.) wall of tbls main hall show the king presenting the enemies In fetters to the gods. On the left are two rows of negroes and Nublans before Ammon-Ra, the deified image of the king, lind Muth; on the right the Asiatics (Hittites) before Harmachl8, the 1Igure of the king, and II lion-headed goddess (Sekhet). The adjoining scription runs: 'Bringing of the tribute by the good god (.... the king) for his father Ra, when he came out of the land Rheta, annihilating the rebellious lands and smiting the enemies In their dwellings, with silver, gold, khesbet (lapis-lazuli), mafek (malachite), and precious otones, as the conquest of every land hlld been commanded him'. Between the two last pillars In this hall is a stele of the 301b year of Bam.es II., on which, beneath a relief, is a long decree in favour of King Ramses, issued by the god Ptah Totunen. This decree was repeated almost word for word by Ramses m. on the pylon of the temple of Medinet Habu. The other chambers of this temple are less interesting, and their examination is rendered troublesome by the swarms of bats that fly against the lights. They contain only the usual scenes of offerings, most of them unfinished. As the accompanying plan (p. 332) shows, two parallel chambers (pl. 0, N) run off from the N. side of the main hall, while from the ends of the back wall lead two oblique passages (Pl.

We now climb over fallen stones and heaps of sand to the smaller temple, which lies a little to the N. The ·Smaller Book Temple of Abu-SiJDbellies close to the river. The oliff has here been smoothed for a breadth of 90 ft. to make room for the of this attractive temple of Bathor, which in modest oontrast to Ramses's huge monument, will not fail to duce a satisfactory impression. The six statues on the do not project boldly like the colossi of the great temple, but stand in niches supported on projecting pillars. Moreover it is not only the king that is here represented; 
to the right and left of him stand female figures equally large in which we recognize his consort fertari Merienmut. The latter holds a sistrum in her hand and wears a double headdress with horns twisted round a disc, such as is worn by Bathor, goddess of love, whose representative the queen is. The figures at the corners represent Ramses again; on the left in his usual form with a dagger in hiB girdle, and on the right as a fied king, with a crown consisting of the double feather springing from the sun, and the twisted horns -m... Besides the six lossi there are a number, of much smaller statues of the children of the king and queen. Beside the colossi on the right and left of the door are the two eldest sons of the king, viz. (on the right) khope.shf(Ammon in his sword) and (on the left) Rahiuanemif (Ra at his left hand); beside the outer colossi are the princes Meritum (right) and Merira (left); and beside each of the colossi of the queen are statues of the princesses Meritamon (right) and Honttaui (left), with sistra in their hands. The first and third pillars on the right bear interesting inscriptions: 'Be (the king) has made the temple in an excavation (@ 0 8het) in the mountain, in everlasting work, in the land of Khent' 'Frontier-land'or'Bow-land', and 'His Majesty has commanded to make a temple in the land of Khent, in an excavation in the mountain j never was such a thing done before'. A narrow portal admits to the temple, which, to judge from a relief and inscription beside the door, was dedicated also to Ammon and a Bo.rus (em beb).

King Ramses and his great consort Nofertari Mer-en-mut, the)' have made the temple on the holy mountain MNW\ Tu ub' (the name of the moun-I 0 MNW\ tain of Abu-Simbel). On the right, 'the living and good god, great in terror, the brave lion, lord of the sword, has overcome the bellious lands';etc. The pictures on the E. wall (entrance-wall) ofthis hall resemble those in the great temple; to the left, the king, before Borus who hands him the sword of victory, seizes an overthrown Tehennu(N. tribesman) the hair to slay him; to the right standing before Ammon, he sla)'s a negro. The legends are almoet word for word the 8ame as those on the architrave. But in both the pictures in this temple, there appears behind the king the form of his consort fertari, who is named the Erpat ua"., the great princelS, of every grace in her heart, the beloved palm, mistress of both lands, loved of the king, and llnited with the ruler. Several portraits on the pillars (to the right) show her to have been of great beauty. She is represented wearing the fan-crown, the disc and hom crown, and the serpent-diadem, holding in her right hand a sistrum with the head of Bathor, and a 1l0wer-stem in her left. On the S. wall ihe king appears between the deities Horus, lord of MaAa c:::=o t and Seth, who bear long toothed staves, with the notches for the years, and the symbols of etemity. Bere also appears Bathor with a harp, generslly called mistress of Ablhck j which perhaps was a name for bel. Three doors lead hence into a narrow apartment, which 
tains a picture of the queen between Isis and Bathor. On each side of this room is a recess, and another at the back. In the lui is a remarkable figure of Bathor standing in a temple, with a human head and above it a cow's head with homs surmounted by the disc and two fans.

Since her name (Ba-ma-uameferu) is enclosed in a royal cartouche, it is probable that she became the legal wife of Ramses. Friendly tions with the Kheta prince KMtasar were established in the 21st year of the king's reign by the peace mentioned at p. 142. Beside it is a small tablet of the general Ammhi, with the prince &ti, the king's mother Tua, and the princess Bafit-anJa. Farther back wa.rds the E.) is another large stele, with the winged sun-disc neath which Ramses the Great is shewn before Ammon with the double crown, before Harmachis (Hor akhuti, Horus of the two horizons), and before Horus, lord of Ha t the great god. In the following 23-line inscription the king, who spreads abroad fear a.nd terror, annihilated the la.nd of Kush, and subdued the land ofKheta., is compared to the gods Horus, Mentu, and Seth. Immedia.tely to the left of this passage a rock-chamber was covered in 1874 by a party of travellers including Miss Amelia B. Edwards, the well-known writer, who has described it in her interesting Thouaafld Milu up tM Nile. The first chamber, 2.5 ft. deep, is adjoined by another rock-cave, iii ft. deep a.nd 21 ft. broad. This little Temple was dedicated by Ramses to Thoth and Harmachis, the former of whom is here called lord of Khmunu (Hermopolis Magna) in Amonhari (perhaps a name for bel). Both gods are represented in golden coloured dhahabiyehs, before which the king stands worshipping (to the left the boat of Thoth, to the right that of Ammon-Ra). The name of Usertesen II. o 9 Ba-kha-kheper (12th Dyn.), a king celebrated in Nubia, is also found here. The theory that this was the library of the king, of which Thoth was president, is unfounded. Still farther to the left are a number of steles incised in the rock, some of which are cult to reach. One of them dates from Seti II. The farthest to the left is a double stele of the 38th year of Ramses II., inscribed by a prince of Kush named Setau. 84. From Abu-Simbel to the Second Cataract. Compo the Map, p. 801. 381/2 M. About 3 M. above Abu-Simbel, near Feraig on the E. bank, is a small rOCk-temple, dating from the reign of King Ho_ (Hor em heb), the last king of the 18th Dynasty. This temple, which fa.ces the W., was once used as a Christian church; a figure of Christ may be seen on the ceiling and one of St. George on the wall of the main chambeI:. The structure is also sometimes called the Temple Of GelJd Addeh (Champollion), and sometimes the Temple of hudak (prokesch), after a village lying farther to the S.

The four clustered columns which support the ceiling of the main chamber recall the proto-Dorio columns of Beni\lasan (p. 12). A stone bench runs round the walls. On the W. wall is Anuke suckling the infant King Horus, with the words: 'I am thy mother, I give thee milk, it brings to thee peaceful life, youth for thy limbs and strength for thy arms.' Beside her stands the ram's-headed Khnum, lord of the fresh water in Tu-ab. On the N. wall (left) King Horus appears before the ibis-headed Thoth and four different forms of the god Horus, viz. as lord of Mim, of heni, of Bek, and of Maha -all names of places in Nubia. Over the door into the left side-chamber is the cartouche of the king, 'beloved of Ammon-Ra and of Thoth'. On the N. wall the king is led by the hand by Seth, with the ass's head and the god Horus, with the symbol of life. Some of the pictures are now scarcely cognizable. On the W. wall, to the right of the entrance, is the king before Thoth, who promises him strength, health, and victory. The two side-rooms have neither pictures nor sculptures. The Saracen fortress of Addeh (W. bank), sometimes called Skalauf, is named MCUlhakit by ChampoIlion. In the monntains to the S. of it are some almost inaccessible steles and a rock-cave, which is wider than it is deep. The cave belonged to the scribe Pa-uar, prince of Kush and president of the S.lands, fan-bearer at the king's left hand. Two-thirds of it are occupied by a broken seated figure of a god. On the inner side of the entrance is the kneeling figure of Pa-uar before Anuke, mistress of Amonhari. On the walls we see one of the sun-worshipping kings (p. 28), viz. King Ai ( 0 I -<:sz>-)I Ba kheperu ar mat (0 1 Ii 1)1 of King Horus, with sacrificial vessels before Ammon, 
Ptah, and three different forms of Horus. Then prince Pa-uar appears again before Anubis, Sebek, and King Ba kha lea (0 e U)I sen III. (12th Dyn.). Part of the inscription with the name mon is defaced. On the rocky slope to the right of the entrance to the grotto is a proskynema dedicated to the gods of the district, by Kaza, son of a Tutmes. The hill of Shataui is the last spur 
on the E. bank of the range of hills running close to the Nile from Ibrim, and presenting some curious pyramidal formations. At this point the chain bends wards towards the desert.

The British mandant will on request kindly telephone to the fort opposite to have the necessary camels in readiness; but donkeys must be taken from the E. bank. The route at ftrst skirts the stream, passing the above-mentioned temple of Horus of Behent, then turns inland 
towards the mountain ridge, ftnally ascending with considerable steepness to a plateau, where the donkeys or camels are left. The summit of the hill is reached on foot in about 5 min. more after a somewhat steep climb. A rock on the stop bears the names of some famous travellers, including that of Champollion. The view of the broken cataract, which extends for 5 M., is very interesting. The stream here forces its way through ferreous sandstone, not through granite as at Assuan. The boulders at the foot of the rock are coated with dark ferreous Nile mud. The view southwards to the blue hills of New Dongolah is not less attractive, and kindles the desire to visit Upper Nubia, which contains numerous most esting antiquities between this point and We think of the temples of SoZeb and 8e8ebi, the temples and pyramids of GebeL Bat'kaZ, the ftfteen pyramids of Nut'i, Mef'oe with its group of ramids, and the temples of Nagah and All these, ever, are at present forbidden regions for the tourist. At most he may visit the ancient fortresses of Semneh and Xummeh, situated in the Ba!n tl-lJagef' (beny of stones), 37 M. from Wadi J,lalfab. These contain buUdings of the 12th Dyn. and the remains of two temples built by Tutmes III.; aud they are interesting also for the records of the height of the Nile under the 12th Dyn., which show that 2600 years before Christ the Nile rose about 25ft. higher than it does to-day. To viait these spo\! we take the railway to (2S M.) (2 hra.

The expedition from Wildi l,ialfah and back takes 2-8 days. Permission Crom the military authorities is sary, and is somewhat unwillingly granted as Semneh lies beyond the lines. It is much to be hoped that the time will soon come when the way will be open as far as Khart1i.m, which fell into the hands of the Mahdists on Jan. 27th 1885, when the brave Gordon met his death.

Riding Camel. or dromedaries travel about 28 1II. in 12 hrs., or considerahly more if pressed (comp. p. 75); ordinary camels only about 19 miles. The camels should be divided into convenient groups, and the traveller should make sure that he has a comfortable saddle for his ride of eight days or more. A tent, a generous supply of tinned provisions, and water must also be provided. Water may be carried either in casks (bermil), leather skins (whleh, however, impart a disagreeable flavour to their contents after a day or two), or still better in iron coffers lined with enamel (la!lha). The services of a trustworthy caravan-leader should be secured by application to a consular agent or other reliable authority; and guns, powder and sbot, and a supply of money in smaH coins and lIari ..

The oasis and the oracle oC Ammon were celebrated from a remote antiquity. Bacchus Is said to have been the 1Irst to consuU the oracle; and in the legend oC Perseus and Andromeda, the latter was said to have been offered to the sea-monster to save her conn try , in obedience to a response of this god. Hercules presented a great offering to Ammon. Semiramis consulted the oracle on her expedition to Egypt. The law-giver Bocchoris (Bek-en-ranC; 28th Dyn.; 8th cent. B.C.) expelled the Jews Crom the land at the bidding of the god. Psammetikh I. enrolled the Carians with plumes oCcock's Ceathers in obedience to his response. Herodotus relates (111, 25, 28) that Cambyses sent 50,£00 men to take the Ammonites slaves and to destroy their oracle with fire. This force reached the city of Oa,;" &Iso called the I.land of Ike BI" .. d, after 7 days march, and then vanished into space, apparently being overwhelmed by a whirlwind. The oaslo and its oracle are, ever, best known from the visit of Alexander Ill. GI'.al, recorded by do"" (XVII, 49), Quinl"" Curti"", and N'-tan after Aristobulus. After Alexander had made himself master of Phrenicia by the battle oC IS8Us, he marched to Egypt which submitted without resistance. Desiring to consuU the famous O,·acl. of Ammon, he undertook the adventurous march through the desert. Ambassadors from Cyrene met him with a valuable gift of war-horses. His supply of water came to an end after four days, and he was only saved from perishing by an unexpected Call of rain. The way was pointed out to him by crows, flying on the right side of the army. He passed the Bitter Lakes, then 100 stadia (about 10 M.) farther the so-called Oili6& of Ammon, and another day's journey brought him to the vicinity of the temple. Diodorus thus describes the place. 'The monites dwell in villages, but in the midst of their land is a castle fended by a triple w&ll. The 6rst (i.l. innermost) wall encloses the lace of the ruler; the second the women's apartments, with the dwellings oC the women and children and the p&lladia of the place, with the temple oC the god and the sacred spring; the third encloses the abode of the spearmen, etc. A litHe beyond the castle another temple of Ammon has been erected under the shade of numerous large trees. Near it il a spring, called Bp"iug of Ih.8tm on account of its peculiar properties. It is warm in the mOrning, cold at midday, and hot at midnight. 'I'he Image 
of the god is encrusted with emeralds and other gems, and gives its oracular responses in a curious way. It is carried in a golden boat On the ders of eighty priests, who direct their course according to signs from the god. Women and girls accompany the god with songs'. When Alexander entered the temple he was bidden welcome by the oldest priest in the name of the god. Alexander accepted the welcome and promised to worship the god, if he gave him the lordship of the whole earth. The king then asked whetl,er &II the murderers oC his ther had been punished. The oracle replied that no one could aim at the life of him that had made him (i .Ł. of the god); but that the murderers of Philip were punished The 0..,;. of BiUJaA, formerly called also Banlaria (aCter Iskander, xander the Great) lies, according to Jordan's calculations, 9ri ft. below tbe sea-level in N. lat. 29°12' and long. 25081' E. of Greenwich.

The Lifayah are forbidden to enter Akermi, in consequence of their having suddenly seized the town about 40 vears ago', though they were afterwards repelled by the byin. Mo(lammBd Djari, the richest man in the oasis, resides at Akermi as bead of the natives. The ruins now to be found are very scanty. The triple-walled castle described by Dlodorus (see p. Mo) appears to be identlfted with the loftily situated Akermi, also called BI,arldv.h. An early Egyptian structore, discovered here in 18/iS under some modern houses by the Scottisb traveller Jamu Hamillon, was easily recognized as the fore-courl and chamber of a temple or palace. The interior walls were covered with hieroglyphics, hut so blackened wilh smoke that the kings' cartouches could not be recognized. In the thickness of the wsU was a narrow passage, 6 ft. long and 2 ft. wide. In an adjoining street was a coloasal Egyptian gate. Rohlf' confirmed this discovery in 1889. Passing along a narrow, winding passage, he observed a building with foundation-walls of hewn stones, and to the W. of It he came upon the large edillce, the outer walls of which are vlslhle from outside the village, while the inner wall extends to the great square of Akermi. A rough passage admits to a fore-court, 15 ft. long and 10 ft, broad. Two large Egyptian gateways (181/. ft. high) lead to the holy of bolies, which is entirely .tructed by houses; tbe gateways can he passed only through the houses. Rohlfs found a large number of pictures and inscr!ptions here, and copied SOme of them by candle-light. The ceJla was 00 ft. long, 181/. ft. broad, and 181/. ft. high. A secret passage, 2 ft. wide, within the B. wall communicated with the great well of Akermi. Ahout 900 paces to the S. of Akerml lie the ruins of Umm fi.B1t!dh (white mother), facing the town and lying from N. to S. In the time of Cailliaud and Minutoli the mins consisted of the left wing of the way and a covered portion behind.

The exlant remains date from a late period; a fragment bearing a royal cartouche appears to date from Neclanebus I. Mlnutoli farther mentions the corner-stones of a Glrdl. Wall near the temple; they are still to be' found at the N.E. angle. The girdle-wall was 77 paces long and 66 paces broad. It apparently belonged to the second temple mentioned by Diodol'US (see p. 840), for in a pretly grove only about II. M. to the S.E. of it is the Srm Spring, known also to Herodotus (IV, 181). This oval spring, about 110 paces in ference, is now called' .AI .. Hamm4m. The story of the peculiar properties of this spring, repeated by all the ancient writers, in virtue of which its temperature varied al. different periods of the day, rests upon error. For the water has a uniform temperature of 78,/.° Fabr., though it may times appear warmer than it really is, in the often very cold nights, while at midday it may seem almost cold in contrast to the heat of the burning sun. Rohlfs failed to lind In Slwah any con6rmation of the slatements of the natives, reported by St. John, that some of the houses rest upon more ancient buildings. -To the N. of Slwab is the Gebel AfIlIIJll, or hill of the dead, a limestone hill about 100 fl. high and 1800 yda. in ference, perforated with hundreds of vaults, graves, and catacombs. Some of the vaults are large enough for a hundred or more corpses. All the graves have been rifled, and heaps of skulls and shattered skeletons lie around. Half way u\, the hill, on the E. side, is a solilary tomb of more pretensions, with Ita entrance adorned with pilasters. Beyond a fore-court Is a spacious sepulchral cham ber, with two side-rooms, and adorned with a vivid green garland of vine-leaves on a blue ground. In the background are some defaced chiselled figures. At Beled ..... R6m, to the W. of Siwab, Is another cemetery excavated in "hill. Here also are the remains of an ancient Egyptian temple er-R6m), 62 ft. long by 15'/' ft. broad, without any hieroglyphics. A little to the N. of this . temple are some scanty remains of a late period, on the hill '.Am6di .. (Two Columns).

The oasis stretches from N. to S. for about 90 M. (M hrs. travel), and from E. to W. only 12 M. (4-6 brs.), and its population was esUmated by Sebweinfurth at lIMO. The nati ves who pay an annual tribule of SOO purses (500 piastres or 104 Ł. eaeh), or 16601., to tbe Egyptian government, are of a dark complexion and are far from good looking. Every summer they are subject 10 an intermittent fever, which is fatal 10 many. They speak Arabic thougb they are not pure fellabin from lhe Nile but are mixed with the Libyan race.

OIUU. KHARGEH. 36. Boule. 351 describes it as being without inscriptions or representations, though Hoskins reports otherwise. In the N. and S.W. angles are two separate spaces with double chambers, one above the other. The next room is the most remarkable part of the temple. This is the Bacrijicial Challiber, a narrow apartment with a row of four columns supporting the roof, while four others are engaged in the entrance-wall. The builder was Darius, who Is here named in a second cartouche, 'the beloved of AmmOB of Bib, the strong-sworded" whilst elsewhere he is usually styled 'the beloved of Ra and Ammon' (see below). On the inside of the wall, to the right, the king is shown kneeling and presenting two vessels of wine, before the ram's-headed Ammon, lord of Hib, )luth, and )lonth. Two finely carved lines ot hieroglyphics beside this scene .tale: 'This is Ammott of HOl, the great god, strong with the sword; may they (the gods) grant constant peacefnl life'. Beneath is the empty cartouche of the king. On the left side the cartouche beneath a similar inscription is tilled in with the king'. name; while the accompanying representation shows the king presenting wine (of the oasis) to OsiriS, Horus, Isis, and Nephthys. The highly interesting inscriptions and representations on the walls of the Darrow chamber lend it a peculiar importance. Thus at the top, to the left, of the S. wall is the Persian king in an attitude of worship, presenting a rich offering to the deities. Between him and the gods i. a long list of offerings, in horizontal lines. Beneath this scene, and ginning in the N .E. corner, is a Song of Praise, composed by the king in honour of the sun -god Ra in very pantheistic terms. This song, in 46 lines, was first published after copies by Robe,'! Ha/l, the companion of Hoskins, and translated by B. Bi"ch (Transactions of the Bib!. Arch. Society, Vo!. V, London 1816), then more completely by Brug.'" in his 'Reise naeh der groBen Oase' (p.p. 216 seq., Plates XIV, XXV-XXVII). On the E. Wall (back-wall) are sacrificial scenes On both sides, corresponding to each other, to Ammon-Ra, )luth, and Xhunsu. Ammon has the ram's head like the god of the Oasis of Ammon. Towards the N.W. corner of this wall is a mystic inscription, with the title above it: 'The mysterious sayings of Ammon which are on the tables of mulberry·wood.' This text refers to the secret characte,· of ,\mmon, the pantheistic god of the oasis, whose oracular importance appears from the passage 'his voice is heard, but he is not visible to all who draw breath' (line 8K). On the door-posts on each side of the entrance to the next room is an inscription in the so-called ... igmalic (i.e. secret) characters, of which a duplicate is found on the outside of the S.W. wall of the temple. This next room has four columns, and on each side are two side-rooms. The builder was again Darius. The central door in this room admits to the Banctuary, the small door on the right to another room, which evidently was once connected with the sanctuary, for the mystic representations of the two rooms, as reported by Hoskins, are parts of one whole. The partition-wall must be a later addition. The door to the left admits to a staircase, leading straight on to a crypt, and ascending to the left to the Osiris rooms, which are on the temple -roof as at Phil"" Denderah, and Edfu. posite the last flight of steps is a finely-executed inscription: 'List of the sacrifices made by Xing Darius in the golden hall for Ammon of Bib, the great god, strong with the sword'. Another list beneath contains a catalogue of the sacrificial wines from the various districts of Egypt; at the top the Wine of the Oa.i.. Of the three Osiris rooms, the middle one contains the most interesting representations. At the top of the N. wall is Osiris lying on a bier, beneath him are four canopl, to the right lsis and Nephthys; in the section below the Dead Oliri. lies on the ground with Isis and N ephthys kneeling beside him. The laUer are represented as saying: 'Thou art in millions of years, thy soul Is raised to heaven with the soul of Ra. I am the light by day, thou art the moon at night'. To the right is the bull Api., running with the Osiris-mummy on Its back' to the left is a frog (\laI! t) as the presentative of Osiris.

Betlura ( 0 P : )1 ' which closely resembles one of the names of Ramses II. (p P Q + } )1. Lepalus proposes to recognize in this the name, not of the builder of the inner chambers, but of Dariu. I. (521-486 B.O.); but aI this king is expreaaly styled the 'beloved of Ammon Ra, lord of Hib, strong with the sword', .he is doubtless to be identified with Darius II. who is mentioned withiu the temple. Beneath, Darius, accompanied by Hallior with a sistrum aud year-rings oll'ers to Ammon Ra, lord of the thrones of both the lands of Apt-alu (Thebes). On the outside of the N. wall of the temple is another cartouche of Darius (if W BamBri. Whether this longs to another Darius than that named in the other cartoucbes, perhaps Darius I., Or whether this belongs to Darius n. and the name Sdt.ra to Darius I., must remain undecided. H. Brugsch has proved from an Inscription found at Luxor (Stele Maunier), of the 25th year of Pinozem I. (1033 B.O.), that the oasis was used from an early period as a place of banishment. In Ohristian times the schismatic Hellonm (435 A.D.) was banished hither (p. 00). Christian monks settled here, protecting themselves against the attacks of the duins from a place of refuge on the top of the temple, traces of which were seen by Hoskins. At Nadur"h, a little to the S.E. of the great temple, are the ruins of a temple of the Roman period, 9 paces long by 12 broad. It has three doors, above the central and more carefully built of which is the winged 8un-disc. Within the little building is ,found the name of the emperor Anlonin,", which also occurs at lIiur <e-g",,,,,, (see below). He is here said to conduct to the god the lana of Kuu or Huu with its possessions and the W. land with its wines. On the outside are a few Ooptlc names. Fully an hour to the N. of the .town of Khargeh, 17. hr. from the great temple, lies the extensive Christian Necropolis, resembling a city with its regularly laid out streets, but nOw utterly devastated. At the most only a few mortuary chapels are worth visiting. Some of the smaller of these may have been the mausolea of particular families, but the larger were probably sepulchral chapels in which religious services were held in memory of the dead. About 1/. hr. to the N.W. of the necropolis is MU'!"/tlh Desh, an ancient Christian monastery, built entirely of brick except tiie main portal, which is of hewn stone. To the N. of it Is a HIIPogeum, S6 ft. long byiG ft. broad, with three chambers on each side. About 2 hrs. to the S. of Kh&rgeh is the little village of O.nlltlh, with 250 inhabitants. The houses are covered with branches of the orange-tree and pomegranate-tree in place of roofs. The streets are 10 narrOw as to make it difficult for a laden camel to pass through them. About 1'/. hr. from the village are the ruins of a temple, dating from the time of the Ptolemies (Euergetes, Philopator, and Lathyrus), and dedicated to the .Thebau triad, Ammon-Ra, lIuth, and Kbunsu. The ruins, prettily altuated on a hill, are now known as Kasr O,,;lah or KaIr W"li (drawillls of it, see Hoskins, plates XVIl-XlX, anA Cailliaud, pI. XIV). About 1",. hr. .ther is the picturesque ruin of Ai .. u-gay""', a temple, enelosed by a rongh briek wall, 230 ft. long and 88 ft. broad. The entrance is on the S. side. Within the wail is a kind of court of unburnt bricks 50 ft. long and 17 ft. broad, at the approach to which are fragments oi stone with part of a Greek inscription.

Ed-Dlkhel lies "-5 days' journey from Farlfrah (Callliaud, Rohlf.), Ii long days' journey from Asd(\! (Edmonstone), and 8, or at most &, from el-KhArgeh, The last·named route is described below, The oasis was visited in 1818 by Drovetti, in 1819 by Edmonstone, and in 1878 by Rohlfs, with Zittel, J'ordan, and Ascherson, starting from Farafrah, The aseent amid the picturesque elUJ's 01 the so·ealled BtSb d-Cail.liatuI, on the last mentioned route is very impressive. The oasis has at present about 17,000 inhabitants. It Is very rich in date-palms and olive-trees, and produces wheat, barley, rice, dura, and dukhn, though not sufficient for its Own consumption. Large acacias ((!Unl-trees), and frult·trees, such as aprieot and walnut treel, llourish. The chief villages are and B.d,lItd. (see below). The route from el-KhArgeh to Dlkhel leads N.W. to (iii hra.) '.Ai .. .Amdr, there turns due W, to hrs.) Tlnidah, at the E. extremity of the oasis, and proceeds via (A hrs.) BaJad, (fl.l/. hra.)

Here are the shattered remains of a small temple in the lJiaeco-Egyptian style, on which Wilkinson discovered the name Caesar. According 10 Cailliaud's measurements the temple is 711/. ft. long and 81 ft. broad. II consisted of a vestibule, and a larger room with a smaller one behind it, with three doors leading 10 three otber chambers, the central one being the adytnm (plan in CailJiaud's Voyage a Heroe n, XLn, 1). Inside the girdle-wall of the temple is .. scanty spring with a somewhat unpleasant taste.

From this point the oasis of Dakhel stretches towards the W., interrupted twice by the desert, so as to form, striclly speaking, three oases.
