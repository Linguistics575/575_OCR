PREFACE,

The present volume forms the second part of the Edi-
tor‘s Handi’zookfar Eguﬁt, the ﬁrst part of which has reached
a second edition in 18%.

The materials upon which this Handbook to Upper Egypt
is chieﬂy founéed were contributed principally by ﬁ-ofessw
Georg Eben of Leipeic, and Professor Johannes Diimichen of
Straesbur , and their work, winch was main! ' ﬁnished in
1877, has con revised, augmented, and broug :3 up to date
in all practical details by Pro essor August Eiseanhr of
Heidellrefg, who has twice viewed Egyyt for this express

' one. 0 Prof. Ebers the editor is in chted for the account
of t o Nile—voyage as far as and including Piliko; Prof. Dii»
michen contributed the descriptions of the temples of Den—
derah and Edfu. of the town of Keneh, and of the caravan—
routes thence viii. the quarries of ﬁamﬁmﬁt to Binge: on the
Red Sea; while the routee in Lower Rubin and to theWest-am
Cases are Wholly iron: the pen of Prof‘ Eisenlohrl

The praetieal introduction to the ﬁrst volume, and the
sections on the geography, history, and art of Egypt, there
oublished, apply of confse also to the districts of Upper
Egy 1;. The special introduction to the pmsont volume deals
chie y with the Nile voyage and the necessary preparations
for it, preceded by a brief survey of the chief steamer—routes
between Egypt and Europe and a note on the new Eg} ,tian
monetary system, introduced since the. publication 0? the
Handbook to Lower Egypt A list of works on Egypt is
milled, and, to obviate the necessity of too frement re~
ferences to the ﬁrst volume, also a chronological list of the
rulers of Egypt down to the close of the Ptolemaic period.
and a selection from the royal cartouchos of most frequent
occurrence in Upper Egypt. Finally the Arabic Alphabet
is given, showing the system of transliteration adopted in
this Handbook.

The MAPS and PLANS have been an object of especial
care. The former are based upon the large mapa of .Ke'eperig‘
Legisi'w, ami 1357mm; the latter chiefly upon the plans 0:
Lepss’us, though with the necessary additions and corrections,
while some have been specially preparcﬁ it PM Eiaer'JOhr:
Page-8
v1 PREFACE.

HEIGHTS above the sea-level and other meaeuxememe are
given in English tee: or miles.

Though nearly every page of the Handbook has been
compiled from personal observation and experience , and
although the conservative East is not nearly so liable to
changes as the more progreeeive Wesl, the Editor makes no
claim to abgolute accuracy in every detail; and he will feel
indebted to an traveller who, from personal experience,
may be able to méicate errors or omissions in the Handbook.
The same remark appliee equally to the PRICES am} various
items of expenditure mentioned in the volume. The expense
of a tour is much more directly affected by the circumstances
of the moment ami the individuality of the traveller in the
East than in Euro we; though it may here be addeﬁ that the
arrangements of l essrs. Cook and Gaza (pp. 21v, xv), of
whieln most visitors to Upper Egypt will avail themselves,
oﬁer a comparative immunity against extortion. A carefully
drawn no contract will similarly protect those who prefer to
hire a dhahablyoh for themselves.

and some gold coins, and that ﬁnds» new form the only legal cur-
rency throughout the whale country, Wham thair wine is uniform.

In Corral: there are also pieces of 1[z and 1/. Millieme (called also

(or hnkshish by tourists.

The diﬂerence between Tariﬁpimtres and Current-pinata; has been
legally abolished; but it still lingers among shopkeepers, so that pur-
chuers should he coreful to ascertain in which reckoning the prices of
goods are stated.

The Pound Sterling (Giné‘h mam» is worth 97 iastres 5 milliéme;
the French Nam Franc piece (Rim, de ived from 'apoleon Bonaparte)
77 pin. 1‘]: mill.; the Turkish Pound ( 'l‘.‘ Ma'idiyeh) 875/4 piastres. A
"purse‘ is equivalent to 500 piastres or about 1 3.

Before starting on the Nilejonrney travellers are recommended to
provide themselves with at least 40 or 50 ﬁnnes‘ wnrth of small Egyptian
coins (especially 1/: piutrss, t and 2 milliome-pieces, and copper). Even
in Cairo a commission is charged on the exchange.

III. The Nile Journey.

The ascent of the Nile may be made either by Steamer or by
Dhahabi‘yeh. The former is recommended to those who have not
more than three or fun weeks to devote to a visit to the Nile valley
and the monuments of the Pharaohs; and in fact for the immense
majority of travellers , especially for those who do not belong to a
party, the steamers are the only practicable means of making the
journey. Travellers, however, who desire to make a closer acquain-
tanoe with the country, who have abundance of time (to Assufm and
back at least 7-8 weeks), and who are indifferent to a considerable
increase of expense, should hire a dhahabiyeh (p. xix).

The company met with on board the steamers is generally un-
exosptionahle, though, of course, it is always wise to use some little
exertion to secure an agreeable and sympathetic cabin-companion.
The trunks to be taken into the cabins should be small and handy,

for ﬂu: acmmmoﬁaﬁon is Malawian: limited. Greater cartels reafﬁrm
in the choice of companions for the dbahabiyeh—voyage, for the close
and censtant intercourse in rather narrow quart-era and for per-
haps two months at a time is apt to produce somewhat strained re-
imam; between those who are not originally sympathetic. The
‘dhaha’biyeh Liavil‘, indeerﬂ. is famous in Egypt for causing these
who have embarked as frienrls to disembark as fees. In especial trav—
ellers with scienﬁﬂc aims should avoid travelling with those whs
have no particular interest in the gigantic remain}; of antiquity, and
who are thus constantly wishing to push on hurriedly from sheer
ennui. In all cases it is prudent to distribute the various cabin!

and seats on the divan by lot before starting.

the enly means of a satisfacmﬂiy close examinatian of the country
and its monuments. A party of 4-5 liaisons wiii be {011ml advisable,

A large seiecticn of good dhahabiyehs is to be found at Cairo,
en the left bank of the Nile bath above and beiow the new bridge
at Bﬁiﬁk. Travellers who take tha train from Cairo to Asaii}; should
despatch their boat from Cairo about a fortnight in advance, fer

xx NILE JOURNEY:

The chartering of a private clhshabiyell is mach cheaper though
much more troublesome. The ﬁrst step is to engage a. Dragoman,
not without a careful enquiry as to his record at the ccnsuleie and
from the hotel-keoyers. and an examination of the testimonials from
previous travellers. There are about 90 dragomaus in Guirc, all
more or less intelligent and able, but searcely a half of the number
are trustworthy. Most of them speak English or French, and e few
speak Italian.

The following are well spoken of1Hauan Speke Ahmed Ramadan.

It cannot lye loo strongly impressed upon the traveller that it is essential
for him ta show from ‘he very beginning that He is and. intends to '6.
main the master. Even the best dregomu‘na are inclined to retromze Sheir
clients, a tendency which must at (man be quashed,

The next step is to select a suitable dbehabiyeb assisted by the
dregoman. A contract is than made with the dragoman, either e11-
tmsting him with the entire preparations. or aseigniug to him only
the duty of engaging and paying the re‘is and crew, while the trav-
eller retains the commissarlat deyartment in his own hands. The
re'is or steersmen is a most important functionary upon whcse skill
during the often slormy passage the safety of the vessel depends.
”he crew number from R to iii according to the size of the éhnlm~
biyeh. The vessel is either hired by the day [far 2- pers 5—3l.,3 -
er 4;) 8:5 6-7l ) m: chartereri for the wholr- return—voyage to As suan
(far ‘2 pers 300 350L, 3 or 4. pure. 3504005.). in me former case
the dragomm will try to travel as slowly am possillln to protrael his
engagement; in the latter case he will press on, 50 as to save
beat-hire and boarﬂ, The latter arrangement is preferable, km: the

ﬁght of halti .g for léu20 days in the course of the journey should
carefully be stipulated far, The dragaman must also provide don»
keys and camels for the excursions. Farther details are indicated
in the following draft-contracts, in which it is believed that nothing
of importance has been overlooked. The contract must be signed at
the traveller‘s consulaie, either with the dragoman alone if he has
undertaken the whole of the arrangements, or with rhe dragoman
and re'ie, when the traveller has hired the dhehabiyeh and Paysbaard
to the drag omen.

without taking the trouble to investigate its claims. Finally, how-
ever, Lepsius, equally at home in both ﬁelds, stepped into the frsy
and his second masterly essay may be taken as the last word on the
subject. He shows that the development culminating in the poly-
gonal ﬂuted columns of Benihasan can be traced step by step in
the cavern-structures of the Egyptians of the ancient kingdom, and
the also shows that, though the Doric Column of the Greeks is

with paintings. Mast of the representations were painted on a thin

may conclude that it was overlooked. The fact that the portrait-like

more true to nature than in any other Egyptian monumeni nay be due
to tins gruaior liberty of divergence from the hieratic eanon allowed in a
reign which was so unfavourable to the prisstly dogmas. These reliefs
excited the special admiration afﬁne Greeks. A Eellane who visited them
inscribed his name as admiring the art of the priestly stone-cutters

dened the subjects with the weaknesses of the prince so that his dew
farmitiea might not appear as anything unusual. Amenhotep IV.

one, and may have instilled her fellow-countrymen at the Egyptian

A. broad arm of the Rain“ Yﬁsnf (p. 3-5) flows through the middle
of the town. The mosque of Kait Bay, on she N. side of the 9mm,
now somewhat dilapidated, is the only interesting building of the
kind. It contains numerous aniiqne columns, brought from the
ancient Arsinoé, some of which have shafts of polished marble with
Arabia inscriptions, and Corinthian and other capitals. Beiow the
mosque, on thebank of :‘ue Ban: Yﬁsuf, are some remains of ancient
masonry, No ancient inscriptions have been discovered here, but
the walls of some of the houses contain fragments which must
have belonged to ancient temples, At the W. end of the town the
Balu- Yfianf radiates into numernus branches, which water the
country in every ireutien. The dilapidated mosque of $91? situated
here forms a piomresqne faregwnnd.

period, have been found here, including numerous smail terracotta

fragments of Homer, Euripides, Thucydides, also of a Christian
esteehetieal book), many are Arabic from the 2nd cent. of the He»

Mile-«Persian, and Masonic—Ethiopian characters. Several fragments
in hieratlc and hieroglyphic characters, the oldest from the time of
Ramses 111. (about £300 Bil), have also been discovered. As the
writings are for the mast psi-t eax-papers, it has been supposed that
they belonged w a tax ofﬁce of she town at Crowdﬂnpolis, where
aid papyri also were need. A large number of the papyri found
haze were acquired by Consul Travers for the Berlin Museum, and
even a larger number by Timed. Grai‘ and'Archduks‘Bsiner for the
