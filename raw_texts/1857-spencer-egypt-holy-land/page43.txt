16 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

the world has become familiar in connection with the name
of one of Rome’s greatest of generals.

We spent considerable time in looking at Pompey’s Pillar
from various points of view, and particularly in searching for
the inscription, which formerly might have been comparatively
quite legible, but is now certainly difﬁcult to be found—prob-
ably ere long it will have become entirely erased. It was not
till a second visit, and on narrow inspection, that we suc-
ceeded in detecting some parts of the words which are given
by Wilkinson as the inscription which denoted the uses to
which the column was appropriated, and the date of its erec-
tion on its present site. By the aid of a ladder, and chalking
out the letters, Mr. Salt and the distinguished scholar just
named were enabled, a few years ago, to make a complete
copy of the inscription, which is on the side facing the old
port, or Eunostus portus, and between the base and the shaft.
It is as follows:

ascertained that there was, in the time of Diocletian, a pre-
fect whose name was Pompeius, who, it is thought, erected
or dedicated this column to the glory of his victorious master.
Dr. Clarke traced the Greek characters so as to substitute
Hadrian instead of Diocletian, and discovered that the name
of the prefect was Posthumus .rather than Pompeius. Some
have inferred, from its Arabic title,.Amz’td es-Sowarz', that
the column is connected with Severus, and some have even
attributed it to Julius Caesar. It is most likely, however,
that Sir Gardner Wilkinson is correct in this, as well as
other things in relation to ancient Egypt; he, you will ob-
