JERUSALEM, April 17th, 1849.
My DEAR 8.,

IF I have not wearied you beyond what you can pardon,
I hope that you will give me your attention still further to
another and considerably longer excursion than that to Beth-
lehem and its vicinity. I had hoped to have been able to
include in my letter dated yesterday an account of a visit to
the Dead Sea, the Jordan, Jericho, etc., but so many busy
thoughts were stirred up in my mind by being actually in
the city of David, where our Lord and Saviour was born,
aud so attractive were the themes suggested by these sacred
localities, that I was induced to dwell more at length than
was perhaps desirable upon Such things as must touch every
Christian heart: there was no alternative, therefore, but for
me to throw myself upon your indulgence, as I now do, and
to beg that you will go with me, in spirit at least, to regions
hardly less interesting than those around Bethlehem.
