VIEW FROM THE SUMMIT. 41

Nearer by, the large and rather fine bridges, built by the
Saracens over the canals which lead from the Nile to irrigate
the country, formed a prominent feature ; and almost at one’s
side, the Second Pyramid, the Third, and the many smaller
ones scattered around, together with that mysterious idol, the
Sphinx, engaged our attention, and afforded abundant food
for serious reﬂection. In many respects the View was pleas-
ing, and in all instructive; yet, though I felt the force of
What was before our eyes, and acknowledged the deep interest
attaching to these mighty monuments, and the eventful and
important history of this land, my mind was ﬁlled with
mournful emotions, and I gazed long and steadfastly at a.
scene, which it is out of my power adequately to describe.
Death, death, ruin and decay—these formed the prominent
characteristics; death, without hope of renewal—ruin and
decay, without expectation of re-enlivening power and energy.
The tombs of the dead, the ruins of once mighty cities, the
scant remains of former greatness and glory, the degraded
descendants of a mighty people, all were about me and before
my eyes; and the words of the prophet seemed to write
themselves deeper than ever in my memory :—

“The sword shall come upon Egypt,
And great pain shall he in Ethiopia,
When the slain shall fall in Egypt,
And they shall take away her multitude,
And her foundations shall be broken down.

Thus saith the LORD,

They also that uphold Egypt shall fall;
And the pride of her power shall come down;
From Migdo! to Syene, shall they fall in it by the sword,
Saith the Lord GOD,
And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate,
And her cities shall he in the midst of the cities that are wasted.
And they shall know that I am the LORD,
When I have set a ﬁre in Egypt,
And when all her helpers shall be destroyed.“

* Ezek. xxx. 4, 6—8.
