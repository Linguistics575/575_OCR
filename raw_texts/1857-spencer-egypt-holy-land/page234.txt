CAIRO, March 19th, 1849
MY DEAR 8.,
IT is one of the most delightful of a Christian traveller’s

privileges, to ﬁnd in the places of his sojourn, the services of
the English branch of the Catholic Church, conducted in
their purity and integrity ; and to be permitted on the Lord’s
day, to assemble with even the few who meet together for this
purpose, and to offer up united prayers and praises, in the
very words which have become consecrated by long use, and
thorough conviction of their entire accordance with Holy Writ.
I shall ever esteem it as one of the brightest spots in my re-
collections of Egypt, to have been favored, not only with an
opportunity to kneel in the house of God, and listen to His
servant, who there expounds His Holy Word, but also with
the privilege of becoming acquainted with the learned and
excellent Missionary and his family, who have been laboring
for many years, so zealously and so effectively, among the
Coptic Christians of Egypt. I have been partaker of so
many acts of kindness, and been treated with such warmth
