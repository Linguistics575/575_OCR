A GLIMPSE 0F CAIRO. 31

during that time, we have been busy in making arrangements
for our trip up the Nile: hence we have given but a small
share of our time and attention to the city, where we are
sojourning. We have been several times to the bazaars;
have ridden and walked through the streets or lanes on vari-

perhaps is it a ﬁt subject of regret; but you will believe me,
that I could not reconcile my mind to omit the Pyramids,
even though I did not expect to satisfy myself with one or
