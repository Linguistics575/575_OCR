THE GHAWAZY AT ESNEH. 105

pages with any accounts of scenes, which are only equalled
by some of the outrages upon morality in certain portions of
Paris. That it may not be supposed that my language is
stronger than the occasion warrants, I beg to use the words
of Mr. Lane, than whom it would be impossible to ﬁnd a
higher authority: “ The Ghawazee often perform in the court
of a house, or in the street before the door, on certain occa-
sions of festivity in the hareem ;, as, for instance, on the occa-
sion of a marriage, or the birth of a child: They are never
admitted into a respectable hareem ; but are not unfrequently
hired to entertain a party of men in the house of some rake. In
this case, as might be expected, their performances are yet
more lascivious than those which I have already mentioned.
Some of them, when they exhibit before a private party of
men, wear nothing but the shintiyan (or trousers), and a tob
(or a very full shirt or gown) of semi-transparent colored
gauze, open nearly half-way down the front. To extinguish
the least spark of modesty, which they may yet sometimes
aﬂ'ect to retain, they are plentifully supplied with brandy, or
some other intoxicating liquor. The scenes which ensue
cannot be described. I need scarcely add, that these women
are the most abandoned of. the courtesans of Egypt.”* Sir
G. Wilkinson uses language equally strong, and characterized
by indignation and warmth. But I need not dwell upon so
ungrateful. a topic; and, had I not felt compelled, as a Chris;
tian and a minister of the Gospel of truth and purity, to
utter words of warning and remonstrance, not a sentence
should have'escaped me in regard to the matter. Having/as
Itrust, discharged my duty, let me dismiss the subject en-
tirely; and in my next, let me introduce you to ancient
Thebes, and its world-renowned ruins.
