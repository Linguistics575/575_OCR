,another, stand out to view in the maze of the many roofs of
houses, some with low .vaults, some ﬂat, and surrounded by
distinct, perforated walls, which again we pursue, until we .
,cast a calm look into the great court of the Haram, inacces-
sible to us, and contemplate the beauty of the mosks, of the
octagonal Sakhrah, covered with the most beautiful oupola
imaginable, and of the Aksa, reminding one of the Basilica
form of the Christian churches, surrounded in solemn silence
and almost melancholy, by the lively verdure and ﬂourishing
trees, such scarcities in these parts. If we turn our eyes tow-

limits the horizon in a wide sweep, commencing at the moun-

visible. Nearer to us, and in the same direction, lies a ridge,

lastly, towards the east, we have the valley of the Jordan
beneath us, where a green streak on a whitish ground marks
the course of the river towards the Dead Sea, into the mirror
of which we here and there look, between the undulating
hills on this side, and see how it reﬂects the rocky shores be-
yond. And if we follow the eastern boundary of theplain
of the Jordan from north to south, there is a continuous chain
of mountains, as far as the steep cliffs of the Dead Sea, above
which rises, deeper in the country, Jebel Shihan, with its
