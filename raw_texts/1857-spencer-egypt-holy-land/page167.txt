140 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

silence the principal portion of this grand temple, simply ask-
ing you to go with me a while into the large hall of assem-
bly, and look at it a little more closely. We have entered,
you will recollect, through the pylon or doorway, crossed an
open court or area nearly three hundred feet in width, with
a double line of columns down the centre, and have come
to the propyla and entrance leading into the great hall: no-
tice for a moment what a wall is before you, rising up aloft
some eighty or ninety feet, and being more than thirty feet
in thickness; what immense blocks of stone are these, what
strength they possessed, what towers of defence against as-
sault they must have proved! what lintel stones are those
over the doorway, more than forty feet in length! Let us
enter the hall and look about us. It “measures,” says Wil- .

avenue of twelve massive columns, 66 feet high (without the
pedestal and abacus) and twelve in diameter; besides 122
of smaller, or (rather) less gigantic dimensions, 41 feet 9
inches in height, and 27 feet 6 inches in circumference, dis-
tributed in seven lines on either side of the’former.” Stop
for a while and examine one of these columns, so massive,
wrought with so much skill, and adorned with such a variety
of sculpture: what singular design has been displayed, what
strange conceptions of art, what surprising accuracy in exe-
cution, along with equally surprising errors and faults: go
which way we will, and the coup d’wz‘l is strikingly grand
and impressive; so many of the. columns are standing and in
good preservation, that we could not have a ﬁner specimen
of Egyptian architecture than this, and the few that are
prostrate or half fallen, afford us an opportunity to look at
them and wonder as much as we will at the powerful means
employed to cut out of the quarries and put in their present
places such extraordinarily large blocks of stone. Notice the
sculpture on one of these columns; generally it is in intaglio,
sometimes in has relief: what singular beauty and nobleness
