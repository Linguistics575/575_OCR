NABLUS IN ANCIENT DAYS. 421

While I am writing, the dragoman is bustling about, and
making preparations for our departure. Standing not far off
are some of that wretched class of persons, lepers, holding out
their boxes for alms, and begging most piteously for aid.
Poor creatures! how deeply do your sufferings move the sym-
pathies of Christian hearts, and how earnestly do they make
one long for the Divine power and compassion of Him who
heard the cry of the leper, and said, “I will; be thou clean!”
Despite the ill-treatment we have met with in this an-
cient city, we cannot but acknowledge its beauty of situ-
ation, and its consequence as the chief town in Samaria. It
is said .to contain about seven thousand inhabitants, among
whom are a hundred and ﬁfty Samaritans,.and if we may
judge from appearances, possesses considerable wealth and
resources. Its present name is derived from the title which
it received in honor of Vespasian, viz. Flavz'a Neapolis,
whence the Arabic Nabulus, or Nablus. Anciently, it was
called Shechem, Sychem, or Sychar, and calls up the recol-
lection of events which transpired ages ago. Abraham
dwelt herc. Jacob pitched his tent before this city, and
bought a parcel of a ﬁeld, which afterwards he gave to his
son Joseph. Here Joseph’s brethren came, to feed their
father’s ﬂock; and not far hence, they consummated-their
wickedness, by selling their brother into slavery. Here J otham
uttered that beautiful parable to themenof Shechem,»respe,ctc
ing the trees; which went forth to choose a king. — And here
our blessed Lord came,.at the urgent prayer, of the people,
and abode two days in their midst, proclaiming unto them
the life-giving words of His Gospel. But I need. not enlarge
upon these topics; and my time issvery short. In a little
while, we shall be all ready,-.and in the saddle again. urMay
God bless you, and permit me to reach the haven of ,rest,
whence I will write you again! .
