PROCESS OF BUYING AND SELLING. 187

with whom we have dealt before. He is delighted to see us,
presses us to mount the mastabah and take a pipe; the latter
‘we decline, courteously of course, and beg him to show us
the burnoos. I ﬁnd one which ﬁts me tolerably, and I in-
quire the price; being a customer, he does not advance on
what he means to take more than eighty or a hundred pias-
tres, and for the same reason, I do not offer him less than a
hundred below what I purpose giving: then begins the
speechifying; he expatiates upon the superior quality of the
article; beseeches me to handle it and see; and declaring
that he cannot for a moment entertain my offer, diminishes
his price, nevertheless, thirty piastres. I listen with the ut-
most gravity, assure him that I do not particularly care about
the burnoos, and am in doubt whether to buy one or not; but
on reﬂection, I advance my offer twenty-ﬁve piastres. This
only excites the Turk, and the phlegmatic merchant gets on
his feet, and with a gesture of impatience at my hardness,
solemnly declares his ultimatum, which is sixty piastres less
than the original price asked. At this point I determine
upon my course; as I do not specially need the garment at
this time, I say to him, rather indifferently, “\Vell, as you
please; in consideration of having traded with you before, I
will tell you what I will do; I will give you a hundred and
seventy-ﬁve piastres for the burnoos, and no more.” This,
by the way, is within ﬁfteen of what he has offered it to me
for; he shakes his head, and says, no; so I get up and'take
my leave, to try elsewhere; but hardly have I got ten,feet
away from his shop, before he calls me back, and says, “lVell,
well; allah akbar ; take it; you are an old customer, and I
can’t refuse you.” So, by this roundabout and time-losing
process, I get what I want at about a fair price: and so, in
fact, is the way with nearly every purchase which one makes
in Cairo.

On the whole, I am notlsure but that you will be wearied
with this attempt to give life to scenes which must be viewed
