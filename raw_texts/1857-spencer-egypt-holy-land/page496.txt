THE VILLAGE on sun. 467

and the whole aspect of nature lowering and gloomy; and
though it be fanciful to associate such things with the ruin of
ancient cities, we have felt at least that they were no unmeet
accompaniments to a scene of unmitigated desolation.

It is quite impossible in the brief space which I have allot-
ted to me in the present letter, to pretend to enter at all at
large into the many deeply interesting questions respecting
Tyre and its history, which are suggested by its name and
importance in past ages. At present I can only speak of
two or three matters, hoping at some future period that I may
be able to take up the subject again, and treat it more fully
and satisfactorily. The present town is small, lying on the
north~east side of the peninsula, and evidently in a depressed
and miserable condition: the south portion of the island (as it
once was) is literally a mass of ruins; and the western and
southern sides are occupied by a few hovels amid the rocks,
and used, in accordance with prophetic language, as places to
spread nets upon. We walked through many of the narrow,
crooked lanes, and thought that We had never in any oriental
town witnessed greater ﬁlth, misery and degradation; not~
withstanding, here and there is a palm tree, and occasionally
the dreariness of surrounding objects ‘is relieved by some of
the beautiful Pride of India trees in retired portions of the vil-
lage. A few boats of ﬁshermen were lying listlessly in what
is now the harbor on the north-east, near the causeway which
joins the island to the main land; and as is evident, there is
little or no commerce or trade, and no sort of activity or life
in the town of Sﬁr.* While exploring the portion of the ruins
near the present southern wall, we came unexpectedly upon
the remains of an ancient church, which was all the more in-
teresting to us, from our recollections of Eusebius’s statements
in regard to the famous cathedral erected or existing here in

* Recent travellers estimate the population ofSﬁr as high as 3000 or 4000, of
whom about half are Christians. If I may venture to guess, having no data on
which to base an opinion, I should say that the population did not exceed 1500
in all.
