472 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

the city seems to have enjoyed a large commerce under the
empire, and St. Jerome speaks of it as the noble and beauti-
ful city of Phenicia. It was taken by the Saracens about
A.D. 639, during the khalifate of Omar, and is said to have
possessed a considerable trade under the Mohammedan rule.
It was taken by the Crusaders, A.D. 1124, and continued in
the hands of Christians a city of importance and strength,
until A.D. 1291, when the Mamelukes seized upon it, plun-
dered it of everything valuable, and left it in a dreadful state
of misery and degradation. In 1516 it fell into the hands of
the Turks under Selim'; and ever since that date it has been
sunk in ruin and deprived of all its wealth, grandeur, and
importance. So that, though the vengeance of God is some-
times long delayed, it is none the less certain ; and His word
is exactly and literally true, and has been for hundreds of
years, when He said of Tyre, “They shall destroy the walls
of Tyrus, and break down her towers; I will also scrape her
dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock. It shall
be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea:
for 1 have spoken it, saith the Lord God :”—“I will bring
forth a ﬁre from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and
I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all
them that behold thee. All they that know thee among the
people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and
never shalt thou be any more.”at

As we ﬁnished reading the prophetic word,'and noting its
precise fulﬁlment, we turned away from the scanty remains
of haughty Tyre with mingled emotions of sadness. sorrow,
and self-abasement; and we breathed an earnest aspiration
that our beloved city and country may take warning, and
remember always that “ righteousness exalteth a nation;
but sin is a reproach to any‘pecple.”l‘
