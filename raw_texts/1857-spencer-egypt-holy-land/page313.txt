JERUSALEM, April 13th, 1849.
MY DEAR S.,

I HAD hoped that my limits would admit of entering
upon a description of several prominent objects in the Holy
City ; I had thought, that I might be able to give something
of a connected account of the interior of the city, and the
buildings and localities of importance, such as the mos]: of
Omar, the Temple-area, the Armenian, Latin, Greek and
other convents, the Tower of Hippicus, etc. ; but I ﬁnd that
it will be quite out of my power, and I shall be compelled to
pass over in silence, several points which require large space
fairly to examine, and to conﬁne myself to a few of the topics
of interest, which it would be unpardonahle to omit entirely.
Probably, you will see little cause to rcgret this present ne-
cessity on my part, for the excellent work of Mr. W. H
