GIZEH AND ITS VICINI'rv. 35
masses of stone stand wholly alone, on the edge of the desert,
and without a solitary object with which the eye is familiar
to serve as a contrast or comparison ; and hence the specta-
tor is readily deceived, his imagination leading him to expect
more than the reality warrants, and his eye being unaccus-
tomed to judge of heights and distances, except by compari-
son with well-known objects. But however this may be,
there can be little doubt about the fact itself, which is noticed
by nearly every writer whom I have read in connection with
the Pyramids.

The village of Gizeh, from which the Pyramids usually
take their name, is at present of no importance, and presents
nothing worthy of a visitor’s attention. Once, it appears, it
occupied a position of considerable consequence, and was
rather distinguished for some features which are now utterly
lost. Wilkinson mentions that the custom of hatching eggs
in ovens, which we know was practised in the times of the
Pharaohs, is still in vogue, and to those interested in such a
sight, it might be an inducement to spend a few hours in
Gizeh. For ourselves, however, we preferred getting away
from the importunate beggars, the crowds of donkeys, camels,
water-carriers, children, loads of vegetables, and so on, and
as soon as was practicable, we arranged our party in its usual
order and rode briskly forward. The path Winds over an ex.
tensive plain, across broad ﬁelds of grain and ploughed lands :
now we pass a small village with its grove of palms, its mud
cottages, its heaps of rubbish and ﬁlth, its pigeon or dove-
cotes, its unattractive and generally repulsive-looking inhabi-
tants; now we have to cross some half-ﬁlled canal; anon we
approach the tents of some Arabs of the desert; and fre-
quently are beset by children demanding bakhshz‘sh, or an-
noyed by the furious barking of a pack of lean, wolﬂsh-looking
dogs: all this time the Pyramids are distinctly in view, and
though you are certainly drawing nearer to them at every
step, you are astonished to ﬁnd that they are miles distant,
