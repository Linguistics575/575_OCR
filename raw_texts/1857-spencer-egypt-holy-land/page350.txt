THE DOME OVER THE HOLY, SEPULCHRE. 321

appeared to Mary Magdalene; also, where He appeared to
the Virgin Mary; the place where the crosses were discov-
ered by Helena; the exact spot marking the centre of the
world; etc. etc.: but as these are manifestly without founda-
tion, save in that desire—here, I fear, not disinterested—of
ﬁxing every event and circumstance to a local habitation, we
can well dispense with putting on record what will excite,
in some, sneers of contempt, and in all, stir up' feelings of
sorrow mingled with indignation. Let us look with some
care at the few things here of real importance to us and to

of the church, and now serves as an arch of passage between
the rotunda and the choir, which is in possession of the Greeks.

the mysteries of our Lord’s passion, and all having in them
some highly valued relics or supposed testimonies of Christian
verity. Let us glance a moment at the ediﬁce, or house of
stone, standing here over the spot where the Holy Sepulchre
is thought to have. been. Lamartine describes it as “:an
