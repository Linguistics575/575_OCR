attained some elevated position, either among the hills, or
amid the massive ruins of Karnak or Luxor,’I have been
compelled to admire the extent, not less than the beauty, of
this plain or valley, which is nearly thirty miles in circum-

the ancient Egyptians, or their taste and judgment in the
selection of a site which would most ﬁtly display~their pro-
