80 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

style, as you will easily imagine, but usually consisting of
the various articles which can be obtained in this part of the
country. Beef is a meat we can very seldom get, as the
pasha has forbidden the slaughtering of animals so valuable,
and at present so scarce, as the buffalo breed of oxen, 860.:
hence, as sheep and goats are numerous, mutton is our sta-
ple, and for variety, we have chickens, now and then a tur-
key or goose, and pigeons, or such birds as may be shot by
any of the party when on shore. Vegetables are not easily
obtained; potatoes are very dear, and must be brought from
Cairo; but onions, coarse beans, and salads, are found in
abundance all along the river; and as already our potatoes
are gone, we have to depend upon those articles, for which
Egypt, in the days of Moses, was celebrated, and for which
the rebellious Jews longed so eagerly.* Dinner being an
important meal, it is.protracted generally as long as possible,
not so much on account of the attractive fare set before us,
as because it is something of an object to get through with a
portion of time, where there is so little variety to relieve the
monotony of day after day, and week after week’s limited
amount of occupations and enjoyments. During the long
evenings, after tea, as the air is damp and chilly, we usually
conﬁne ourselves to the cabin, and peruse and reperuse the
scanty stock of books which we have brought with us; or
attempt to write; or engage in conversation, or something
of the sort, till the hour of retiring, which is usually at ten
or eleven o’clock.

You must not infer, my dear 8., from this meagre outline,
that all days pass stupidly and lazily with us, in the mere
succession of getting up, eating, drinking, smoking and sleep-
ing. By no means; we do have inklings of adventure every

’* “ The children of Israel wept again, and said, who shall give us ﬂesh to
eat’l We remember the ﬁsh which we did eat in Egypt freely: the cucumbers,
and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic: but now our soul

is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes."—
Numb. xi. 4-6.
