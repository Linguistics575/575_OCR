414 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

ere night set in ; and the knowledge of the {act that the!»
mountain-sides are infested with petty thieves and vagabonds,
induced us to hasten away towards the city. .Turning to "the
west, we entered the lovely valley between Gerizim and Elanl
on either hand. Gradually ascending the slope towards the
city, we were gratiﬁed with the View, of the profusion of
