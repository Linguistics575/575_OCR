our: SHEIKH AND HIS ~MARE. 379

time I have mentioned the very respectable person so named,
and the noble Arab mare which he bestrides as only a Beda-
wy can. Let me remedy this oversight without delay‘
You may recollect, that this part of Palestine is usually
counted unsafe to travel in without an escort; and the Beda-
win ﬁnd it to their advantage to keep up this idea, as it
brings them into notice, as guards or attendants, on the
principle, I suppose, “ set a thief to catch a thief,” since they
themselves are the very enemies against whom they offer to
protect you, if you pay them a good round sum. For some
time, we doubted whether we would not go at our own risk,
deeming ourselves—such is the vain self-conﬁdence of our
countrymen—abundantly able to protect ourselves, and quite

oriental courtesy, took the lead for the rest of the journey. I
assure you that he was a picturesque and striking object, and
attracted a good deal of our attention. His mare was of the
best breed, and full of life and ﬁre, and yet docile and gentle as
a lamb. He himself, clad in the usual Bedawy dress, had ona
brilliant crimson mantle, and a silken covering for the head,
fastened and arranged in that peculiar manner which half
covers the face, and permits you to see underneath only the
glittering black eye, casting forth its duick, sparkling glances,
