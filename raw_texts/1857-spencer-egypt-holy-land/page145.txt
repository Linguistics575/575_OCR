118 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

been ﬁnished by the sculptor; the various Egyptian divini-
ties; and such like matters, are points on which I must not
attempt to enlarge, and respecting which the larger volumes
of Wilkinson and others can alone give satisfaction. At best,
too, though I made two visits to Belzoni’s tomb, and spent
Some hours in examining it, I must confess that I have but
a confused recollection of the vast variety of hieroglyphical
decoration, the strange profusion of serpents and reptiles of
different sorts, the singular and mysterious ceremonies alluded
to in some of the sculptures, the numerous gods and goddesses,
the various ﬁgures of men and animals, and the many groups
which are scattered throughout the halls and chambers; .I
could not, however, help being struck with some peculiarities
in the representation of human ﬁgures, and noting them at
the time. The shape of the head is excellent, and proves ,at
once that the Egyptians were no more connected with the
negro race than ourselves: the expression of the face, too, is
pleasing, and in many cases very sweet and attractive ; but the
ﬁgure is very remarkable for extreme tenuity, and a slenderness
of waist in the female, which is beyond anything attainable by
the modern devotee of fashion. In other respects, while one
could not but admire the artistical skill displayed in the design
and execution of these ﬁgures, taking into account the early
period at which they were drawn and sculptured, there was
much room for regret that the knowledge of perspective was
not more extended among a people who manifested talent of
1such high order in the arts in general. If I have an oppor-
tunity by and by, I may recur to this point again: now, I
must leave this,,as well as some minor matters relating to

typify the four divisions of the world, or the whole human race. Earlier writers,
quoted by Dr, Russell, give a different view of these sculptures, supposing that
the period referred to is the time of Pharaoh Necho, who conquered Jerusalem
and Babylon (see 2 Kings, xxiii. 29, etc), and his son Psammis or Psammuthis,
who made war upon the Ethiopians: hence the people indicated would be the
Jews, Ethiopians, Persians, and Egyptians. The opinion of Wilkinson is,
however, entitled to the greater weight, from the fact that no Egyptologer ex-
cept himself, has devoted the time and attention to Thebes which it deserves.
