A STONING IN NABLUS. 415

which was very vexatious and annoying, but of no great con-
sequence: the result of all this, as you may suppose, was,
that ver‘y soon a considerable excitement was got up against
us in this fanatical city. The old people, and parents in gen.
'cral, began to come out to the doors to see what it was all
about, and as, by their smiles and laughs of encouragement,
they pushed the younger ones on to extreme steps, so it hap-
