34 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

For some little time we rode along the bank of the Nile,
opposite the beautiful island of Rhoda, where, according to
Arab tradition, the-daughter of Pharaoh came to bathe, and
saw the ark of bulrushes in which was the infant Moses,
whom she saved from the ruin which had been denounced
against the male oHspring of the oppressed Hebrews. In
this same island is the celebrated garden of Ibrahim Pasha,
which has become quite well known as indicative of the skill

and here, too, the inhabitants of Cairo love to resort for par-

means of which the daily rise of the Nile is ascertained and

500 feet in height, and more than 740 feet broad at its base;
and indeed, throughout the remainder of our ride, while these
massive ediﬁces were in full view, which was for more than
two hours, I was quite unable to realize the truth, as it is
established by the measurement of scientiﬁc men, and with
difﬁculty persuaded myself that these were really the vast
monuments of other days with which our thoughts had be-
come familiar, and which we were so anxious to inspect.
What may be the precise reason why the Pyramids appear
so much smaller and less imposing than we imagine they
ought to be, it isnnot very easy to say ; the common explana-
