174 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

however, that I have deceived myself, and that you prefer the
excellent and complete description of Mr. Lane’s, to the ram-
bling and often dull remarks of mine on these topics, I give
you full liberty to pass over the whole, and to leave me to
suffer the just punishment of my presumption.

Let me ﬁrst invite you, if you will, to imagine yourself stand-
ing at the window of my room, and gazing upon the panorama
which constantly passes before your eyes. You are looking out
upon the Ezbekiyeh, a large park or plat of ground, planted with
trees and arranged into walks: it is irregular in shape, being
about half a mile in extent either way, and as you see, it winds,
as it were, for a considerable distance, both right and left; the
ﬂowers and fruit trees, and the shady walks, make it a de-
lightful place of resort for those who are fatigued or annoyed
with the bustling, noisy streets. In former times this whole
space was a lake, during the season of the high Nile; bute
large canal which surrounds it, and at present is, as you see,
dry, has drained it, and not only removed a disagreeable pool
of stagnant water, but furnished to the Cairenes a beauti£ul
public square and garden. Our street is one of the few wide
enough for vehicles of any size to pass and repass, and
most of the hotels for foreigners are collected together in
this locality. You will readily see how great an amount of
travel on foot and on horseback, on donkeys and in carriages,
must here take place during the day.

’ Well, then, very early in the morning, the donkey boys
assemble with their useful steeds on the opposite side of the
street, and keep a sharp lookout upon the doors and windows
of the hotel; every once in a while they make their selamét
(the usual “ how-d’ye-do,”) to me, or some other passenger
who has patronized them the day before, and endeavor to pre-
vuil upon me to engage for an indeﬁnite period an animal
which has perhaps shaken me almost to death,.or——as on one
occasion—precipitated me over his head, or has other and
equally valuable qualities. Near by, under the same trees
