380 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

and the bronzed, haggard cheek and expressive mouth of the
wild son of the desert. He seemed to delight in setting forth
the excellences of his mare; and as his crimson mantle ﬂoated
in the wind, when he rushed by at lightning speed, or lay in
graceful folds, around him, as instantaneously he stopped his
milk-white steed by a slight touch of the bridle, he was cer.
tainly an object worth looking at, and helped very much to
relieve the tediousness and dreariness of the way. I may as
well mention here, while it occurs to me, that so far as Icould
judge from appearances, we had no need whatever of the sheikh
and his men; but I will not be too sure, that if we had re-

but I cannot, and I must throw myself upon your indulgence,
and beg you to imagine what it must be, and is, in reality.

You will readily belieye me, that our Saviour’s touching and
truthful parable, which has the scenelaid on this very road, lost
