MUSINGS UPON DAVID’S CAREER. 355

for the glory of the Lord God of Hosts: how wise, and
prudent, and valiant, and surpassingly skilful in playing
upon the harp, did the noble youth become, so much so that
Saul loved him greatly and made him his armor-bearer, and
the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David with
a love surpassing that of women. I could easily fancy him,
returning from the novel and wearisome splendor of a court,
to the peaceful and happy occupation of once more feeding
his father’s sheep on these hill-sides of Bethlehem: I could

many a sigh for the peaceful hours when his soul had been
wrapt into communion with Him whose praises he has
sung, in strains of such marvellous sweetness and beauty.

It needs not that I dwell upon the various points of inter-

Bethlehem itself on our right, and gazed upon it in its pic~
turesque position.on the side of a hill near the top; at another
we passed, at intervals, near several small villages, situate in
retired spots among the mountains, and not infrequently in
some deep dell, shut out, as it were, from the neighboring
world: in general, we rode for hours amid scenery of the
most varied as well as most interesting kind; now making
