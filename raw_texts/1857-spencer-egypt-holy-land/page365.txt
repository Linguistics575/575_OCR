336 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

the Capitoline Jove, on. the holy mount where the Lord’s
house once stood, and the latter he permitted, if he did not
direct, to be insulted and rendered contemptible, striving'to
blot out the memory of Calvary and the tomb of Christ, by
placing over them the idol fanes of Venus and Jupiter*—a
singularly unwise and unsuccessful effort; for not only were
these localities well known to the Christians in Jerusalem, as
is evidenced by this act on the part of the Roman tyrants, but
so gross and outrageous profanation of sites revered by them
on account of what had there transpired, naturally and neces-
sarily served to deepen and perpetuate the memorial of the
place where the Lord poured out His blood, and where He tri-
umphed over death and the grave. It cannot, therefore, be
doubted, that the very means taken by the persecutors and
enemies of the cross to trample under foot the faith of Christ,
tended materially to preserve the recollection of places such as
these; and though Hadrian appears to have relented some-
what, and to have forbidden the prosecution of Christians in
Palestine, without just cause, it does not appear that any
change was made in respect to the shrines of Jupiter and Venus,
or that Calvary and the tomb were ever relieved from the
odious connection with heathen folly and impurity; nay,
rather, it seems not improbable that the peculiar species of
insult which forced those who came to pray near the place
of cruciﬁxion to be apparently devotees of idols, afforded great
gratiﬁcation to the dominant party: may we not well believe,
that under such circumstances, our elder brethren in the faith
never could forget what those fanes were meant to lord it
over and to destroy utterly?

It is not necessary for our present purpose to enlarge upon
the trials and persecutions of the Christians under succeeding

* Mr. Milman, in his “ History of Christianity” ([1. 308), thinks it improbable
that the emperor wished to insult the Christians by this step; as it is amatter
of opinion, merely, on his part, it needs little consideration in this place;
I prefer to follow the generally received historical statement.
