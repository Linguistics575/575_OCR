402 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

looked our last upon the Tower of David ; skirted the western
wall; turned to the right at the north-west angle, and after
another survey of this portion of the wall and ground, joined
the main road, which leads almost directly to the north of
Palestine. We did not now stop to examine the various
localities near the road ; we had before visited the Grotto of
Jeremiah, the broad plain beyond the Damascus Gate, the
ruins in the neighborhood, the tomb of Helena, Queen of
Adiabene, :the tombs of "the Kings, &o., and now we were
leaving them all, and our feet were no more to tread the hills
and valleys about Jerusalem. Crossing the olive grove,
where the green grain gave tokens of life and industry, we
passed the supposed tombs of the Kings, and entered upon
the rocky path beyond. Ere long we reached the heights of
Scopas, and under the brilliant light which even the declining
sun affords in Syria, we gazed upon the Holy City for the
last time. It was a long and an earnest gaze; for only about
a mile distant was the city of the Lord our God, silent, sad,

been our stay l—struck upon our sight; we remembered what
we had beheld and enjoyed, and we thought with sorrow,
that we should see them again no more forever. The dome
of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Tower of David,
the Mosk of Omar, the minarets here and there, were prom-
inent objects in the view, within the walls; while outside the
city, the valley of J ehoshaphat stretching away in the distance,
the heights and slopes of the-Mount of Olives, and the sombre-
hued mountains of Moab, from this spot just visible, served
to add as well to the beauty as the interest of the scene. We
could not look upon all these things without deep feeling, and
We halted for some little time before we could bring ourselves
to turn away and 'look no more. I will not attempt either to
describe or to analyze my emotions; Iwill only tell you what
I did, and how apt and meet seemed the Psalmist’s words,
