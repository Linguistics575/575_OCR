26 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

how deplorably governed—so far as the prosperity and wel-
fare of the people at large are concerned—is this land, blessed
in so high a degree with a fertile sail, a lovely climate, and
means and resources for wealth of which the present race
appear to have no conception.

About midnight we arrived at Atfeh, a small, dirty village
of no great consequence, where the canal joins the Nile by
means of two locks. At this season, the boats have to de-
scend to the level of the river, some four feet or more below
the water of the canal; but during the inundation, of course
the Nile runs into the canal, and ﬁlls it to a much greater
depth than it is at present. I ought to have mentioned above,
too, that the cisterns and reservoirs at Alexandria are sup-
plied with the Nile water by means of the Mahmi’idieh canal:
this fact, added to that of the continual drain on the canal by
lowering vessels to the river, and raising them to the canal
through the locks, tends materially to interfere with its capa-
bilities for navigation, and at the period called the low Nile,
the canal is very shallow, and will hardly admit the passage
of heavy boats. Considerable delay, and a great deal of noise,
shouting and barking of dogs, occurred in passing the locks,
transhipping the luggage and disposing of the passengers, in
one of the most contemptibly little and inconvenient steamers
which it has ever been my lot to be on board of ; but delay
is so common, inactivity so almost universal, and steam nav-
igation so comparatively recent in this part of the world, that
I am not sure that it is right to complain; but whether it
be or no, it would be of little or no use. The Egyptians
have a way of their own of doing everything, and that way,
as you may imagine, is usually the worst of all ways which
could be devised; and notwithstanding the inﬂuence of

'Europeans, particularly English and French, is very great,
still it will take severacl generations before the skill and
enterprise of Christian nations will be able to accomplish
