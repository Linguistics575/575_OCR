BOAT LIFE ON THE NILE. 77

in general, requires to be watched and made to know that he
has a master. "

These are particulars hardly worth relating, and certainly
of little consequence in themselves; but as illustrative of life
on the Nile, and the multifarious preparation required for a
journey of this sort, may not be deemed quite out of place.
In truth, it is rather a serious matter to get entirely ready
for some two months’ absence in a boat, where you are com-
