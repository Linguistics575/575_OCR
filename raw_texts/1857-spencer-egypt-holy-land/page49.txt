22‘ EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

and a long and illustrious line of successors, ruled over and
fed with food convenient the Church of God, and Where,
alas, for ages, heresy and Mohammedan imposture have tri-
umphed over the truth, as it is in Jesus; where, too, the
bigoted fanatic, Omar, condemned to the ﬂames the world-
renowned Alexandrian library,* to his everlasting infamy,-
and our unutterable less; desirable as I might esteem it to
tell you of our visit to the bath of Cleopatra, or to the Cata-
combs near the sea-shore, those remarkable subterranean
burying-places, on which so much speculation has been be»
stovVed; Alexander’s tomb, as it is termed, a spot which it

Macedonian conqueror’s ashes; the vicinity of the city, where
the pasha’s fortiﬁcations astonish one by their extent, and, if
I may say so, their inutility, and where the broad plains pre-‘
sent an appearance both interesting and painful,—interesting
by the peculiarities of oriental scenery, and painful in conse-,

consisted of 700,000 vols, which were ordered to be distributed for heating the
public baths, for which purpose they answered during six months. Gibbon and‘
some other writers question the truth of this statement, and the modern Moham-
medans deny it strenuously; but the weight of testimony ﬁxes this act of Van-
dalism where it is usually placed, and as has been justly said, “ the Caliph Omar
will forever bear the odium of having devoted to destruction that library, whose
num'erous volumes are said to have sufﬁced for six months for the use of the
4000 baths of this immense city.” Milman’s note upon Gibbon (vol. iii. p. 522)
