328 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

wards, probably, to embalm it properly ; Joseph owned a gas.
den near to Calvary, and in it was a new tomb, hewn out of
the took; into this, because of the lateness of the hour, the;r
laid the sacred body, and placing a great stone against the
portal of the ,sepulchre, they, and the pious women who had
been looking on, went to their homes, and rested, according to
the commandment, on the Sabbath-day, which began at six

the Jews’ preparation-day, for the sepulchre was nigh at
hand.” ,

'Now, we are here met, at once, with a very serious difﬁ-
