ARRIVAL AT GAZA. 245

on account of the quarantine. I demanded Why, when Egypt
was perfectly healthy, they stopped us for this purpose: he
laughed, and said, “for the money, to be sure I” which is
undoubtedly the fact. After an hour’s detention, we went
on towards Gaza, in charge of,a soldier on horseback: the
road is over a broad and fertile plain, with sand hills between
us and the sea on our left: at a quarter past ﬁve, we crossed
the Wady Gaza, which is a considerable stream in winter,
but at this season is dry. The bed is of a ﬁne sand and gravel.
Gaza appeared in the distance, and looked rather well, on the
hill, on which it is partlyvsituate. ~Albeit not in the poetic
vein, we did think of Tasso’s lines :

That leads to old Pelusiurn, Gaza stands;
Built on the shore, it overlooks the bay,
And on the east the bordering tract commands,—
A fruitless waste, a solitude of sands,
Which, like the waters of the tossing main,
The breathing whirlwind spreads o’er all the lands;
And scarce the pilgrim can his course maintain
Against the frequent storm that sweeps th’ unstable plain)“

and were met with the disagreeable intelligence, that we
had to spend ﬁve whole days, and parts of two other days,
seven days in fact, in this vile prison-house. The rooms are
damp, and when it rains, wet and nasty; and you can imag-
ine what a trial it was to us, who had ridden nearly ﬁfteen
hours that day, to ﬁnd such accommodations, and such a re-
ception, when we arrived, fatigued and half sick, as we nearly
all were. ,
Gaza is a name which will call to your mind some of the
many interesting portions of the Old Testament history. It
was once a city of great importance, and ﬁgured largely in
the eventful life of Samson, the mighty champion of his
