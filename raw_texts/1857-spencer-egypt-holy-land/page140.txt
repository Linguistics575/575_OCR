WEST BANK OF THE NILE. 113

city. On the west side of the river horses are supplied,
though I cannot say much in their favor as respects speed,
bottom, or other “qualities; they answer, however, very well
for present necessity, and carry the traveller over the ground
quite as fast ashe desires. For some distance we rode along
the shore, and could not but admire the prospect which was
aﬂ'orded by the river, stretching away in both directions as
far as the eye can reach, the opposite bank, with the ruins
of Luxor near by, the lofty, towering propyla of Karnak in
the distance, and the range of hills which bound the view on,
the east still farther off; after a while we turned off from the
river’s bank, and following the course of the valley, passed in
full view of the vocal Memnon, which we did not now stop
to examine, and in the course of an hour and a half came to
the foot of the hills, or mountainous range, in which are the
tombs of the kings. It took us some time to ride through
the vast collection of gravel, sand, and chalky formations
which lie strewed around, and it was by no means difficult
to fancy ourselves in the midst of the chambers of the dead,
so desolate and wholly removed from everything which has
life is the necropolis of ancient Thebes. May it not, too, in the
opinion of, the early Egyptian teachers of religion, have had
a. good effect upon the living, thus to see continually before
them, as the inhabitants of this great metropolis must have
done, the vast dwelling-place of the dead, and to know that
soon they likewise must occupy the space allotted to them in
the tomb? From all that we know of the better features of
their religious system—unhappily that is very little—it ap-
pears evident that they turned their attention quite as much
to the subject of death and the preservation of the perishing
body, as to care for the living and the every-day concerns of
this ﬂeeting existence.

We made it a point to enter Belzoni’s tomb ﬁrst of all,
both on account of our respect for the distinguished man who
discovered it, and because it is in itself very remarkable for.
