486 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

over which I have no control. One thing, however, is certain,
that I can never forget the profound and solemn interest of the
last few months, during which we have looked upon so many

nations of the West, as they are but agents in the hands of
the Supreme Ruler of the universe, so they are, .unconsciously
