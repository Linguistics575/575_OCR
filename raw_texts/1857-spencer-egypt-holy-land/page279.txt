252 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

more commanding elevation, in the midst of the bright and
verdant ﬁelds of grain for miles in extent, gave a picturesque-
ness and beauty to the scene, far beyond the power of words
to express. In truth, the land of the Philistines, through
which we were passing during the day, appeared to me one
of the most lovely tracts of country which I had ever seen;
and its exceeding fertility served to remove from my mind
some of the wonder which I used to feel at the vast, and, as
it were, almost numberless population, which it aneiently
possessed, and which warred with the children of Israel so
frequently and so successfully. The beauty of the country,
too, as well as the ease and facility of travel over so level and
fertile a tract, seemed to me decisive of the question in re-
gard to that passage in the Acts, where Philip was directed
to “arise and go toward the south, unto the way that goeth
down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert ;” for it
would be quite out of the question to term a road or way
desert, which passed through a country like this. I have no
doubt, therefore, that the reference is to Gaza itself, which
at this date was partly in ruins, and might properly be termed
’e’gqyog, desolate, desert, &c.

As we rode along, I could not help thinking over various
portions of Holy Writ, in relation to the history of the chosen
people; and I saw abundant occasion to recognize the hand
of God, in His proceedings with the rebellious descendants
of those who were so severely punished in the desert. You
recollect, that it was the express command of J EIIOVAH, that
they should go up and destroy utterly the inhabitants of the
land, whose iniquity was full, and the cup running over.*

f “ When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou
guest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittit’e‘s,
‘and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaenites, and the Perizzitee,
and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than
thou; and when the Loan thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt
smite them and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them,
nor Show mercy unto them; neither shalt than make marriages with them;
