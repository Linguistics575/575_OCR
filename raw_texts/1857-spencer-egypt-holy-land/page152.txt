more to notice the singular symmetrophobia, as it is termed,
which characterizes many of the pillars or columns in these
temples. Here, in one of the large courts, as at Philae, it
seemed not a little curious, that no two columns are alike,
and that the artist has bestowed more care and labor to make
each one different froni the other, than to give them all that
elegant symmetry and ﬁnish, which, to our notions, render
the Grecian styles so attractive. “The next area,” says
Wilkinson, “is far more splendid, and may be looked upon
as one of the ﬁnest which adorn the various temples of Egypt.
Its dimensions are about one hundred and twenty-three feet
by one hundred and thirty-three, and its height from the
pavement _to the cornice thirty-nine feet four inches. It is
surrounded by an interior peristyle, whose east and west sides
are supported by ﬁve massive columns, the south by a row
of eight Osiride pillars, and the north by a similar number,
behind which is an elegant corridor of circular columns,
whose effect is unequalled by any other in Thebes. Nor do
the colors, many of which are still preserved, tend a little to
add to the beauty of its columns, of whose massive style
some idea may be formed, from their circumference of nearly
twenty-three feet to a height of twenty-four, or about three
diameters.” It is this grand court which the artist has
usually chosen to sketch and present to our view. There is
something rather grand and very interesting in the sculptures,
of a historical character, on the walls of this vast court, com-
mencing at the inner face of the tower: they are much too
elaborate and extensive, for me at present to undertake to
describe them; and as the author of “Modern Egypt and
Thebes” has devoted a number of pages to an accurate de-
scription of the battle scenes here sculptured, I must beg
to refer you to them, as on every account worthy a re-perusal.
What struck me the most was the spirit and skill of the
artist, who has succeeded in depicting scenes of this kind in
a manner worthy of the later and better days of art; and,
