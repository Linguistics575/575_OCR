TRACES on CHRISTIAN CHURCHES. 97

in the main temple, over the entrance to which is sculptured
that striking symbol, the winged orb, where I discovered two
or three crosses of St. John, cut into the wall near the door-
way, and inscriptions in Greek under them, stating the fact,
that at one period our brethren in the faith of Christ here as-
sembled to worship. This room is about forty feet square,
and is adorned with ten noble columns, measuring fourteen
feet round, and covered with carvings 0r sculptures of Various
sorts, many of which have been defaced, or plastered over as
an easier way of hiding them from view. The capitals of
the columns are all diﬁ'erent in design, and have a singular
effect, though it can hardly be considered good taste thus to
seek ornament in an ediﬁce of this sort. Doors are on either
side, leading into smaller chambers, which once appear to
have been elaborately adorned; the light comes from above,
there being no windows in the room, Near one of the walls
I saw a splendid block of granite, about ﬁve feet in length,
which was probably used for an altar when the Christians
occupied: this apartment as a church. I took some pains to
decipher the inscriptions which testify to the fact just stated;
they are cut into the solid wall, but not deeply, and are in
the usual uncial characters. One of these, as a matter of
curiosity I subjoin :—

‘ The above inscription may be found on the west side of the north entrance
to the portico. I am sorry that I cannot inform you at what period this inscrip-
tion was put here, or when bishop Theodore ruled over the church in this vi-

cinity.
