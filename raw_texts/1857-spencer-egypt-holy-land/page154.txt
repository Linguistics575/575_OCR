usually termed it. We left our boat about daylight, and
mounted on horses, rode briskly over the plain towards the
Colossi, which, in the clear light of early morning, appeared
to loom up very grandly. Just as the sun sent forth his ﬁrst,
bright beams, and began to illumine the scene with a glory
unequalled at any other hour of the day, we arrived in front
of these colossal statues, and with ears attent, listened for'
that sweet-toned salutation with which, as so many have tes-
tiﬁed, the “Son of Tithonus” was wont to greet the sun’s
daily appearance. We were not of imperial rank, though-
part and parcel of the “sovereign people,” and so were not'
treated like the emperor Hadrian, whom the obsequious co-

so poor as to do it reverence.

The position of these Colossi is very ﬁne, and doubtless in
the days when they were uninjured and surrounded by the
magniﬁcence which characterized Thebes under the Pharaohs,
they formed objects of wonder and admiration to all beholders.
They are about a mile and a half from the river, which they
look towards, and stand in the middle of a broad plain, and
not very far from the various ruins of which I have spoken
above. It seemshighly probable that these and other colossi
formed part of the dramas or paved approach to the temple,
now no longer existing, on this bank of the Nile, which fact
would accord with the name of “Royal Street,” which, as
