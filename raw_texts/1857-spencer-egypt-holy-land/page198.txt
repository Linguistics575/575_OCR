JOSEPH AND HIS BRETHREN. 171

consequence, nor in the present state of hieroglyphical learn-
ing and research into Egyptian history and antiquity, do I see
how the objections“ of Sir G. Wilkinson to this view can be
answered. Ho informs us that the hieroglyphics above these
strangers, represent them as “ captives ;” that they have the
number “ 37” written over them; that the person who should
.be Joseph, in case it were a representation of the scene sup-
posed, has a name totally unlike his Egyptian name, “ Zaph-
nath Paaneah,” and is styled in hieroglyphics, “Nefothph,”
or “ Nehoth ;” and ﬁnally, that the names of the father and
mother of this individual are too distinctly speciﬁed to admit
the claims of Joseph. These appear to me fatal objections,
and though it is not impossible that they may all be answered,
and this grotto may, after all, assume an importance, which
a settlement of the question in the way desired, would confer
upon it, I dare not believe that I have, indeed, looked upon
a picture so touchingly attractive as this would be, were it
really the representation of the meeting of Joseph with his
brethren. It is true, however, that I gazed upon these an-
cient paintings with an interest too deep for words: and it
was not for a considerable time after my companions had left,
and had called me to come with them, that I could consent
to turn away from this grotto, and look no more upon what
may be, perhaps is, connected so intimately with the history
of the great and good Joseph. You will allow me, I doubt
not, as a ﬁtting conclusion, to refer you to the sentiments of
two eminent living writers, whose spirit of reverence for Holy
Scripture cannot be too highly commended in these rational-
istic days: “I do not pretend,” says Wilkinson, in reference
to the question of who these strangers were, “to decide, nor
do I see sufﬁcient reason for supposing them to represent that
event (viz., the arrival of Joseph’s brethren) ; but should this
ever prove to be the case, they will be looked upon with un-
bounded interest, and be justly deemed the most curious
painting on the Egyptian monuments.” The learned W.
