OUR ROUTE FROM GAZA. 251

during the day. Perhaps no one thing reminded us more
forcibly of the fact, that we had left Egypt, where it very
seldom rains, and where one never thinks of providing against
it, than this circumstance, that now we were compelled to
provide against wet, and to watch with some anxiety the
