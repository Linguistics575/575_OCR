484 EGYPT AND THE IIOLY LAND.

diﬂiculty, and almost nothing the result in the end. And it
deserves to be well weighed by Protestants at home, that no
mission of theirs to/the Oriental Christians has succeeded to
any extent commensurate with the means, the men, the time
devoted to their conversion or restoration to the purity and sim-
plicity of GvoSpel truth: may it not properly be asked,—are
we ever likely to succeed any better? are our efforts be-
stowed upon a ﬁeld of labor from which we shall reap any
harvest? are we really and truly doing God’s work in thus
seeking to eﬂ'ect a change in the corrupt Churches of the
East, from their ancient Apostolic constitution to the system
known only among us Protestants? and shall we not have to
abandon the ﬁeld to those who, agreeing with the Orientals
in their views of the ministry, are ready to carry to them the
words of exhortation, the truths of Holy Scripture in all their
depth and fulness?

I venture to throw out these remarks for your considera-

Presbyterian and Congregationalist friends, who have desired
my opinion, being willing to trust to my candor: they are

rowness of bigotry which refuses to acknowledge good any-
where but among ourselves. I repudiate and abhor such a
spirit. I acknowledge, and beg particularly to state, that
much good has been done in Syria by the American mission;
Beirut and all this district feel and know how much has been
done for the cause of education, and for the beneﬁt of the poor
both bodily and spiritually ; and the community in general
are deeply indebted to the quiet but ﬁrm inﬂuence for good
order, sobriety and religious truth, exerted by our countrymen
in the city and neighboring mountainous districts. For these
things I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice; but I hold it to be no
more than my privilege to say frankly, and yet decidedly, that
I am apprehensive that with the good they have done are
mingled the seeds of evil, which will spring up yet to trouble
