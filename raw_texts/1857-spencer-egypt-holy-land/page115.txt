88 EGYPT AND THE HOLY Lani).

erect, ﬁnely formed, and by no means deﬁcient in beauty: I
might enlarge upon the magniﬁcent skies of southern Egypt,
more glorious, or at least more marvellous, than aught ever
seen in our cold regions; where the stars sparkle like suns,
and the surface of old Nile seems to glitter as if ﬁlled with
diamonds, wrapping the beholder almost into extacy, and lift-
ing the devout soul up in aspirations of praise and gratitude
to Him who created all these things for His own glory. I
might indeed tell you a long, long story, and whisper in your
ear that, after all, one becomes tired of the monotony and
tediousness of living in a boat for months; but it needs not;
you, I will not doubt, have had enough, and more than
enough, to satisfy you that life on the Nile must be rather
stupid, if my attempted description of it is any certain index
of its true character and attractions; and I am quite sure
that you will feel no special regret if I end here Without an-
other Word. In my next letter, I hope to interest you in
something of a very different nature from that which has
formed the staple of the present letter.
