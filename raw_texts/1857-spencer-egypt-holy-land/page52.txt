MAHMUDIEH CANAL. 25

has” been the custom for travellers to take a boat, which is
dragged by‘ horses when there is no wind, until the Nile is
reached, and then the wind, or the labor of the men, is eni-
ployed to complete the voyage to Cairo: but at present, since
the overland travel to and from India has increased very much,
and is on the increase, the “ Transit Company,” under the di-
rection of the pasha, agree to convey passengers for a stipulated
sum, by'means of steamboats, from Alexandria to the metropolis
of Egypt. It was in one of this company’s vessels that we took
passage, along with a noisy and rather riotous party of cadets,
on their way to India, and were tugged by two small steamers
ahead, attached to our barge or boat by a large rope, until we
arrived at the point where the canal joins the river, when we
were transferred to another small steamer for the remainder
of the voyage.

The scenery along the Mahmﬁdieh canal is, on 'the Whole,
rather uninteresting and monotonous. The villages scattered
here and there present so strange an aspect, with their mud
walls and heaps of dirt; the fellahin appear to be so miserable,
and suffering from destitution and want of all those things
which strike a European or American as essential to happi-
ness and comfort; the almost unvaried and uniform prospect
of broad plains, diversiﬁed occasionally with small hills of
sand, and far away in the distance, on either side, the bound-
less barren desert, are so little calculated to please the eye or
satisfy the imagination, that, could you behold the scene, you
Would not be surprised that I desire to pass rapidly over it,
and invite your attention to other things: at the same time,
I confess that there are now and then spots of brightness and
even beauty; the verdant ﬁelds of grain, the occasional orange
grove, the gardens abounding in vegetables and ﬂowers, the
stately palms, the acacias or locusts, the picturesque country
residence or villa of some wealthy citizen, are reliefs to the
general tediousness of the canal—passage, which delight all the

more from their infrequency, and help to make one forget
