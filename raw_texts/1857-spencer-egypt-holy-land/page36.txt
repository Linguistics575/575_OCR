ALEXANDRIA AS IT NOXV IS.’ 9

that almost necessity of a free and uninterrupted passage for
England to her East India possessions, by way of Alexan-
dria, Suez, and the Red Sea, the change will become still
more marked, and according to our ideas, the improvement in
the city still more important. But as it now is, there is
something very melancholy and unpleasant to one accustomed
to clean and paved streets, to broad avenues regularly swept
and washed, and lighted at night with gas, to elegant ediﬁces
for both private and public use, and to the numerous con-
veniences which mark the reﬁned state of society in the west
of Europe. In Alexandria the streets are unpaved, and con-
sequently either very dirty or muddy; the soil is of such a
character, that either of these conditions is excessively an-

since an unusual quantity of rain had recently fallen, and
the streets and lanes of the city were not a little muddy and.
disagreeable. In general there are no broad streets or avenues,
most of the passages from one part of the city to the other
being narrow, crooked, and arranged with an apparently total
disregard of public convenience. As may be supposed, the
mud reposes quietly, until it is dried up by the inﬂuence of
the sun and wind, and the continual trampling and scattering
of it-by the barefooted fellahin; and the dust blows about to
the inﬁnite annoyance of everybody, until a fall of rain con-
verts it into a thick, clayey, and very adhesive mixture. At
night it is impossible to go out without a servant and a lan-
tern; and, save here and there an occasional glimmer of a
light in some Frank residence, the city is shrouded in dark-
ness and a gloom, which I can hardly characterize in any
other way than as oppressive and disagreeable in the extreme.
If we except the Frank quarter, or that part where the con-
suls and most of the foreigners reside, it is astonishing to
notice what an air of miserable desolation—the term is not
too strong—many portions of the city present: half-ﬁnished

houses, portions of walls, and heaps of stones and dirt, lying
