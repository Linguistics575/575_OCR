THE ROAD TOWARDS THL JORDAN. 377

horses. They looked at us with curiosity, but said not a.
word, either good or bad; a remarkable change from former
days, when it was really unsafe to venture far away from the
Holy City in this direction, and when Christian travellers re-
sorted to disguises in order to pass this road and visit the val-
ley of the Jordan and the Dead Sea. The unevenness of the
road prevented our proceeding at a rapid rate, and I believe
made me notice more carefully than I should have done other-
wise, the force of centrast. Near Jerusalem and all around the
Mount of Olives, the hill- sides are terraced up for the purposes
of cultivation, and though one does not see the fruitfulness
and beauty which might be expected or of which the country
is capable, still, there are evidences of life and industry, to
some extent, in the gardens and ﬁelds under culture; but
when the traveller passes over or around the Mount of Olives,
descends its eastern or southern slope, and finds himself
among the hills and deep rﬁvines beyond, he cannot~but be
struck with the contrast presented by what is before him.
Here and there is a small patch of ground on the hill-side, or
in a deep valley, which has some thin and scanty herbage
upon it, or some grain springing up with promise of future
harvest; but in general, and, almost entirely, on every side,
there is one dreary, desolate, barren look; the rugged preci-
pioes, the stony road, the rocky beds of the mountain torrents,
the very few and dead-looking trees now and then visible,
the white and almost glaring clayey soil and dust, and such
like features of the scene, are different from everything which
I have ever seen elsewhere in the Holy Land ; and the change
from even partial "cultivation of the ground, and from the life
and beauty of many spots about Jerusalem to such an entire
cutting oFf from the world, such unfruitful and sterile regions,
such unmitigated solitude, is calculated to produce, as it cer-
tainly has upon my mind, an ineffaceable impressionﬁ“ At
