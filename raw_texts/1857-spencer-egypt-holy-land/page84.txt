STATEMENT OF HERODOTUS. 57

with Herodotus, have related the traditions which were cur—
rent in their days, and have furnished some facts of a rather
curious nature, and made several statements which it seems
impossible to reconcile with truth. The “father of history”
(BC. 443) enters into a long and, on the whole, sensible
account of the Pyramids. He informs us that the First or
Great Pyramid was erected by a despotic and proﬂigate mon-
arch, named Cheops, that the time occupied was twenty years,
and the number of men employed 400,000: he goes on to
explain the probable mode in which the immense stones of
the Pyramid were elevated to their proper position, expressly
declaring that alone of them were of less dimensions than
thirty feet, and that the Whole structure was ﬁnished from
the top downwards. He concludes his statements respecting
the Great Pyramid with a rather ridiculous story, which one
might think was something of a jest of the interpreter at his
expense, viz., that the outer surface of the Pyramid contained

measurements which have been made of the Great Pyramid at different periods,
and it may possibly serve to justify the expressions used above; inasmuch as
there is here no room for mere speculation, but simply the determining a certain
number of feet and inches: now mark the result.

Perpendicular Height. Length of Sides.

The two distinguished scholars last quoted are undoubtedly worthy of implicit
conﬁdence; but even these diﬂ‘er by ten and twelve feet, one from the other. Is
it not possible to have the Pyramids measured so accurately as that we can be
certain on this point? I would suggest, also, that perhaps the ancinut writers
do not speak of the perpendicular height of the Great Pyramid, but if the he
clined height, i. e., the distance from the base along the side up to the W
