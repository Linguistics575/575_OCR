200 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

and devoted to the second process. The one-eyed operator
placed me on the top of a round stone seat, and then began
to lather me with soap and water over the head and neck, in
such abundance as nearly to choke me, and for some moments
to deprive me of breath. He uses for this purpose the ﬁbres
of the palm, much as we would a sponge; these ﬁbres are
White (those of Egypt are brown), and as Mr. Lane states,
are brought from the Hejaz. After a thorough washing and
cleansing with water almost cold, from a small reservoir near-
by, my Arab attendant had the assurance 'to ask me for
bakhshish, which, as I told him—not very clearly I fear—was
a very great piece of impudence, all things considered. I was
next led back into the large room above spoken of, covered
with four napkins over the head, shoulders, and loins, and
then conducted into the apartment where we had undressed.
Here, laid at length on our carpets, we’ luxuriat'ed in the de-
licious languor produced by the hot bath, and according to
our respective tastes took coffee, inhaled the fragrant tobacco
from the bubbling sheesheh, or lay half asleep dreaming of
those far away in freezing New York. In the course of an
hour or so we had taken our ﬁll of this sort of enjoyment,
and after giving the grumbling bath-men about five times the.
usual price (to a Turkor native it is two or three piastres,
= nine or fourteen cents), we left them, and emerged once
more into the open air.*

Here, however, let me close for the present; we have be-
gun to make our arrangements for leaving Cairo, and ven-
turing into the vast desert on the East; our thoughts are
turned toward the “land of promise,” and I ﬁnd myself a
good deal occupied in getting various matters in readiness for
the expedition. But I mean, notwithstanding, to write you
once more before bidding a ﬁnal adieu to Egypt.
