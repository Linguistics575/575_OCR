dens, or used as thresholds at the gates and doors of houses,
or laid upon the front of waterng troughs. One ﬁne Corin-
thian capital of white marble, lies inverted in the middle of
a street running from north to south, along the eastern foot

Jerusalem. Tischendorff calls it “a busy city, with a popu-

it as low as two thousand; probably, at the extent it does not
exceed eight thousand.

Here I must close this rather discursive letter. On the
day after to-morrow we shall be released from our disagree-
able prison-house, and once more breathe the air of freemen.
If God spare my life, I shall next address you from the Holy
City, that most deeply interesting of all the cities of the

earth.
