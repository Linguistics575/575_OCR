408 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

muleteers were'tolerably good-natured and willing, and as
Antonio was a very thorough-going fellow, we succeeded in
getting under way in pretty fair season; and after the ﬁrst
morning, had no reason to complain of needless delays on the
road. In less than an hour we passed Beitin, or Bethel, on
our right, but did not turn off to examine it at all, our object
being to reach Nablus before night, if possible. The air was
warm, but not to be termed hot, and, excepting occasional
clouds, the weather was clear and delightful. In general, the
country was very hilly, and ofttimes very picturesque and
beautiful. The road, which, as you understand, is only a
bridle path for horses, camels, 860., no vehicles ever bring

for the scanty labor they bestow in tilling the ground.
Leaving on our right Ain “Yebrud, which stands on a
conical hill in a narrow valley, and Gophna on our left, we
skirted the precipitous sides of a deep ravine, and arrived at
Yebrud at half-past eight. We were now entering the por-
tion of country belonging to the tribe of Ephraim, and were
continually, reminded of the change from the generally barren
and sterile regions about Jerusalem to the more fruitful and
better watered country to the north. The hill-sides are tern
raced up and brought under cultivation; and the villages, as
seen at this season of the year, surrounded by their gardens
