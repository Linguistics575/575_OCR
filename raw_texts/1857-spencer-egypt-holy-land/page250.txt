EGYPT PAST AND PRESENT. 223

her seat among the nations.” As she is now, I know not
more apt and ﬁtting words to tell her story in, than those of
that quiet but deep thinker, Sir Thomas Browne, in whose
quaint but striking language let me say farewell to the land
of the Pharaohs :—-—“ Of their living habitations they made
little account, conceiving of them but as stpz'tz'a, or inns,
While they adorned the sepulchres of the dead, and planting
thereon lasting bases, deﬁed the crumbling touches of time,
and the misty vaporousness of oblivion. Yet all were but
Babel vanities! Time sadly overcometh all things, and is
now dominant, and sitteth on a Sphinx, and looketh upon
Memphis and old Thebes ; While his sister, Oblivion, reclin-
eth demi-somnous on a pyramid, gloriously triumphing, mak-
ing puzzles of Titanian erections, and turning old glories into
dreams. History sinketh beneath her cloud. The traveller,
as he paceth amazedly through those deserts, asketh of her,
who builded them? and she mumbleth something, but what
it is he heareth not. Egypt itself is now become the land of
obliviousness, and doteth. Her ancient civility is gone, and
her glory hath vanished as a phantasma. Her vouthful days
are over, and her face hath become wrinkled rind tetrick.
She poreth not upon the Heavens; Astronomy is dead unto
her, and Knowledge maketh other Cycles. Canopus is afar
off, Memnon resoundeth not to the sun, and Nilus heareth
strange voices. Her monuments are but hieroglyphically
sempiternal. Osiris and Anubis, her averruncous deities,
have departed, while Orus yet remains, dimly shadowing tbs
principle of vicissitude and the efﬂuxion of things, but recei.
eth little oblation.”i‘
