466 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

As we draw near to Sﬁr, or all that remains of once proud
Tyre, we could not but be struck with the remarkable fulﬁl‘l-
ment of prophecy, which declared so plainly its coming ruin
and desolation; and as we thought upon its past history, and
contrasted with it its present degraded position, we felt again,
as often indeed one must feel in the East, the truth, power,
and exactness of the Word of God. Tyre, at one period, was
unrivalled throughout the world ; its commerce, its resources,

what we now see, and enclosed a space where now the waves
of the deep blue Mediterranean dash over the remnants of broken
columns and fallen palaces. While thus engaged, and while
thus receiving fresh evidences of the truth of prophecy, we
have seen the dark, threatening clouds hanging over our heads,
the winds rising and lashing into foam the waves of the sea,
