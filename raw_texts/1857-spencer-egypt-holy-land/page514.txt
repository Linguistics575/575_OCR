PROBABLE RESULTS 1N THE EAST. 485

the peace of the Church and produce harm instead of good.
The unsettling of the minds of a body of people ; the insen-
sibly leading them to undervalue and despise the authority
and ofﬁce of the priesthood; the setting them aﬂoat on the
sea of private judgment, exposed to shoals, rocks and quick-
sands ; the exciting of hatred on the part of the constituted
ministers of the Church; the giving Orientals our learning
without their having naturally or by education our checks
and balances; the rendering them prone to doubt, if not dis-
believe, because they ﬁnd so many points which others regard
as settled and sure, utterly baseless, as they now think; and
such like; appear to me to be grave and serious things, and
almost necessarily resulting out of the attempts to convert
the Orientals to Protestantism, instead of striving to purify and
remove the corruptions of the Eastern churches, on the basis
of the Episcopal constitution of the body of Christ. Time
will at least show whether these sentiments be wrong or not;
meanwhile I trust that our own Church will not be negligent
of her duty in these matters ; for I am thoroughly persuaded
that it must be mainly through her agency and that of the
Church of England, that error shall be removed and corrup-
tion taken away from the Eastern Churches; and the Scrip-
tures be brought to light, studied, read, understood, acted
upon; and the clergy be rendered duly alive to their sacred
ofﬁce and duly ﬁtted for their sacred functions, in this inter-
esting portion of the one body of Christ Jesus our Lord. God
grant that the day of renewal may not be far distant!

I shall not, at this time, undertake to tell you of our ex-
cursion to the Nahr el-Kelb, or Dog River, the Lycus of the
' ancients, with its interesting mementoes of other days—its

inscriptions, caves, sculptures, &c. ; neither shall I enlarge
upon general matters connected with our stay in Beirut; but
with a word or two as to the impressions left upon our mind
by our visit to Palestine, I shall close the present letter.
