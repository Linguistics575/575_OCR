viii PREFACE.

especially from its peculiar features, as being conveyed in
familiar letters, very interesting. * * * * * * *

The Writer is evidently a truly modest man, yet an inde-
pendent thinker for himself, and who has everywhere chosen
to use his own eyes and convey his own impressions on the
deeply interesting scenes brought under his view. There is
no aim at fme writing, no tendency to over coloring, but
everything is conveyed with simplicity and strict ﬁdelity;
and there is a. certain vividness, arising from the matter
being written on the spot, while the subjects were fresh in
the traveller’s mind, and absorbed all his thoughts.

From the personal knowledge which I have of the writer,
I should say that every dependence may be placed on the
complete accuracy of the representation which he makes
of the state of things in those countries. Truthfulness, an
earnest seriousness and candor, as they form, I believe, the
characteristics of the man, so they stamp every page of the
writer, whose book will be found especially interesting to
Bible students, from the attention of the pious Writer having
been uniformly directed to the illustration of the Holy
Scriptures.

Upon the whole, I feel assured that you will have no
cause to regret having undertaken the republication of the
work in this country. I am, dear sir, with much esteem,_
yours very truly,

- S. T. BLOOMFIELD.
