DISTURBED STATE OF THE COUNTRY. 429

tine. The fact is, that the government is weak, and well nigh
contemptible, and the villages are continually engaged in
feuds, and broils, and disturbances: only the day after we
passed, two villages along the line of road were at open war-
fare, one with the other, and a clerical friend and his com-
panion fell into that very uncomfortable position, viz.,between
two ﬁres, and managed to escape only by abruptly turning off
and leaving the ﬁeld of action to the mutually infuriated com-
batants. Providentially they soon got out of the range of the
ﬁre-arms, and after a day’s wanderings, they knew not where,
they lighted upon the road once more, and pursued their jour-

fruits of the earth, we left the territory of Ephraim, and en-
tered that belonging to the half-tribe of Manasseh. Passing
Burk’a, with its olive groves, we traversed a broad plain, saw
the village of Fendekumieh, having several fountains near it,
ascended the hills again, passed Jeba (between which village
and the one last named there was a ﬁerce dispute, and the
day following a battle), lunehed under the olive trees, and at
half-past twelve reached Sanur, situate on a high conical
hill. It is a striking object, and even to an unscientiﬁc eye,
wears the appearance of great natural strength, which art
oouldﬂeasily render impregnable. It is now only a petty vil-
