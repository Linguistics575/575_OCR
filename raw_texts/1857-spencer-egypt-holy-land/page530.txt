Met Dr. Wainwright’s and Mr. Minturn’s boat. going up to Thebes;
also, another American boat; head wind all day; rained considerably

~ between 4 and 6 P. M.

Monday, February 19th.

8 A. M. 46° cloudy and disagreeable.
12 M. 50° do. do.

4 P. M. 49° do. and strong N. wind.
8 r. M. 48° do. do.

Wind came up about 9 A. M. and blew us up against the bank;
could not move at all; very uncomfortable day; got off at evening, and
some time early on the next morning, February 20th, we arrived at
Bulak, after nearly two months’ absence.

Norm—The thermometer hung in the open air, in the alcove in
front of the cabin, exposed to the winds which blow more or less
all the time on the Nile. On shore, the temperature was much
warmer (as a general thing), and some days the mercury rose to 110°
and 115° in the sun, during our excursions. The evenings, on the
whole, were damp and chilly; and sometimes even when the mercury
indicated 65° to 70°, the air was raw and disagreeable on the water.
But, with these exceptions, the trip is one of the most delightful and
instructive which can be imagined. The total expense, including bark];-
shish (an indeﬁnable but important portion), amounted, for our party
of three persons, to a little over $500.

A PILGRIM’S CERTIFICATE.

I subjoin the original, more as a curiosity than for any value belong-
ing to it. The Latinity is rather crabbed, though on the whole quite
respectable for the monks of Terra Santa.
