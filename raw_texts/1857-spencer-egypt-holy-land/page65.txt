38 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

the mind; and it is net too much to say—though rather
common-place—that I was overwhelmed with the sight, and
lost in wonder and surprise. \Vhat immense labor, what an
amount of toil for hundreds of thousands, what astonishing
skill and ingenuity must have been exerted in their erection!
How strange does it seem to look at the Pyramids and turn
