ITS PLEASURES AND PAINS. 233

unnatural and so hard upon the muscles of that part of the
body, that you are soon fatigued and soon convinced that you
can never endure it for any great length of time. And when
towards evening you dismount, running the same risk of a
fall as when you went through the operation of getting upon
your camel’s back, you ache all over so badly, your limbs are
so stiff, and you are so completely fagged out, that you are
ready to lie down almost in despair, and groan bitterly over
the prospect before you.

This is usually the ﬁrst day’s experience : on the second,
you ﬁnd camel riding more tolerable; on the third, you be-
come quite reconciled to it ; and subsequently, when you are
entirely at home in your place, riding in any one of a half-
dozen different positions which you may choose, forwards,
backwards, sideways, cross-legged, and so on, and are so
much at ease as to read comfortably, and even make notes
as you go along, you get rather to like this kind of locomo-
tion, and actually ﬁnd that you can go through more on the
back of a camel than on horseback; you are convinced, too,
that for a long journey, the former is preferable to the latter
in many respects, and has advantages which cannot be at-

to conceal from you the fact that I found it a tedious and
wearisome thing thus to ride day after day, at so slow a
rate. I will confess to you that I suffered not only from the
ordinary discomforts of this sort of travelling, but was very
much troubled with pain in my side, sometimes in one, some-
times tho other. I was but little satisﬁed to go at a pace of
between two and two and a half miles per hour, which is the
usual rate of a camel’s walk; and I felt the want of that
pleasurable excitement which generally attends other and
more common modes of travel. Hence, while the other gen‘
tlemen in our expedition, experienced much enjoyment in rid-
ing on camels, I am obliged in candor to say, that, so far as
I was concerned, I was not at all sorry when it was over,
