172 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

Osburn devotes several pages to this interesting tomb or grotto,
which he calls “the tomb of Pihrai,” a person who held a high
military ofﬁce, in the reign of Osirtasen I. This monaroh’s
reign “ belongs to the time of Abraham or thereabouts.” The
learned author’s view of the signiﬁcation of the painting on
the walls, is well expressed in few words :—-“ Without enter-
ing at all into the various conjectures which have been haz-
arded, as to the nation to which these captives belonged, we
at once adopt the plain indication of the text, and assume,
that it represents the tribe or clan of the J ebusites, who,
subdued by the prowess of Pihrai, had sent an embassy to
Egypt, to solicit peace.”=

With these remarks, I must bid adieu to the various topics
which have occupied my letters for some time past: it will
be my design next to address you from the metropolis of Egypt,
and to speak of those things which relate to the living rather
than the dead, and which, just at this time, have an import-
ance far beyond any previous period in their history.
