138 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

ing a feature in the scene, unlike What the eye ever before
beheld: think, too, of the ‘vast propyla, the lofty obelisks,
the extensive courts, the sanctuary of red granite, and such-
like things, and you may perhaps catch an idea of that, which
I have no words adequately to describe, and with which every
traveller, from the enthusiastic Frenchman down to the most
phlegmatic German or Englishman, is enrapturedf’" enter,
if you will, in imagination, and walk amid the ruins: see
what destruction the hand of violence has wrought; notice
the portions of columns strewed about, the broken walls, the
massive stones lying under foot; measure the'eircumference
'nf a column, or the size of a lintel stone, and realize what
immense blocks the ancient Egyptians managed to elevate to
great heights: pause awhile in the grand hall, with its pm
fusion of columns and its decorations, even yet worthy of
admiration, and count its pillars: see what towers rise be-
fore you, and not far beyond, what a magniﬁcent obelisk of
the most beautifully polished red granite, points its lofty head

" M. Denon uses the following language on catching a ﬁrst view of these
ruins: “At nine o‘clock, in making a sharp turn round a projecting point, we
discovered all at once the site of ancient Thebes, in its whole extent. This cele-
brated city, the size of which Homer has characterized with the single expres-
sion of the hzmdrod—gated—n boasting and poetical phrase, which has been re-
peated with so much conﬁdence for so many centuries ;_——this illustrious city,
described in a few pages dictated to Herodotus by Egyptian priests, that h ave
since been copied by every historian,—-celebrated by the number of its kings,
Whose wisdom had raised them to the rank of gods,—hy laws which have been
revered without being promulgated,—by science, involved in pompous and en-
igmatical inscriptions,—the ﬁrst monuments of ancient learning, which are still
spared by the hand of time,-this abandoned sanctuary, surrounded with bar-
barism, and. again restored to the desert from which it had been drawn forth,-—
enveloped in the veil of mystery and the obscurity of ages, whereby even its own
colossal monuments are magniﬁed to the imagination,—still impressed the mind
with such gigantic phantoms, that the whole army, suddenly and with one ac-
cord, stood in amazement at the sight of its scattered ruins, and clapped their
hands with delight, as ifthe end and object of their glorious toils, and the com-
plete conquest of Egypt, were accomplished and secured by taking possession
of the splendid remains of this ancient metropolis.”—Russell’s “ Ancient and

Modern Egypt,” p. 203.
