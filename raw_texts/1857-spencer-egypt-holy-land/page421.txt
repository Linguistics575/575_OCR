392 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

The color of the water is nearly that of gray slate ; and the
river appears to gather much sediment in its course from the
north ; but I cannot express to you how sweet and delightful
the water is. Notwithstanding its turbidness and mixture of
earthy matter, coming from the Dead Sea only two hours
before, the contrast was very striking, for that is nauseous
and pungent to a degree inexpressible; this is delicious and
refreshing to the taste, almost as much so as the water of.
the Nile. Of course, I could not leave the Jordan without

.We lingered in this lovely and secluded spot as longas
we dared; penetrating into the dense thicket, I tried hard to
