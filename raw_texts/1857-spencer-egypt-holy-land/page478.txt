MUSINGS AND ASPIRATIONS. 449

desires of the devout pilgrim to know, in all its richness, the
love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, as he kneels and
prays near the very places hallowed by our Lord’s presence
in the days of His ﬂesh: 0 how weak and very nothingness
is mortal man ! how inexpressibly great and glorious the Lord
our God! Yes, most true is it,

—“I lose
Myself in Him, in Light Ineﬁ'ahle !
Come, then, expressive silence, muse His praise."
