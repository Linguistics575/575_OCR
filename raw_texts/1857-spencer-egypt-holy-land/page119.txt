92 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

deity of whom the Eg ptian stood in such awe, as to lower
his voice and drop his eyes, when he uttered the fearful adju-
ration, “By him that sleeps in Philae!” This interesting
chamber is nearly over the western adytum, and is about
ﬁfteen feet long, by nine wide and eight high. Here, too, we
had a ﬁne view of the island itself and the surrounding scen-
ery; one object in particular attracted our attention: it was
a large stone or rock on the edge of the water, opposite the
northerly end of Philae; it looms up very remarkably, and
presents a form not unlike a vast altar or shrine; possibly it
may have been used for some religious purposes, though that
is denied by the best authorities. To the west we saw the
island of Biggeh, a wild and desolate spot, where are some
few remains of early days, and one or two mud huts built in
their midst; and to the south and west we gazed upon the
extent of the buildings here spread out, the narrow channels
of the Nile, which ﬂow on either side of this lovely island, and
the arid and parched up plains and hills of Nubia stretching
away in the distance. Passing through the portal of the ﬁrst
propylon, we emerged into a large open court, with aﬁne cor-
ridor on either hand, and where, near the commencement of
the eastern corridor, as well as I could make out, is the small
chapel of IEsculapius. The sculptures on the propyla are
colossal, and though in great measure defaced by the hand
of violence, still evince the skill of the artist, and the taste
and habits of the age. In the next passage-way, through
the second propylon, we read the famous inscription which
the army of Napoleon caused to be placed here, and which
has not escaped disﬁgurement;* and on emerging into the
open space beyond, found ourselves in a position of much
interest: we were standing before the Great Temple, in all
its imposing grandeur; while to the south, for a very long
distance, was a continued line of columns, more or less broken,

* Perhaps you may think this inscription worth the trouble we took in copying
it; it is as follows, (see next page) :—
