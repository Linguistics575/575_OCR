400 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

grim’s Certiﬁcate has been duly obtained; our horses and
mules are engaged; our friends, Dr. W. hnd Mr. M., have
already gone; and in a few hours we hope to set off for the
north, and to visit other parts of the Holy Land. Be sure
that I shall address you again at the ﬁrst opportunity.
