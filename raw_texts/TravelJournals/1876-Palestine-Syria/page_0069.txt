shrubs on the banks of the Jordan; warblers, white-throats,
bulbuls, nightingales, sun-birds, Indian turtle-doves, etc."
Leopards still linger near the fords, and wild boars may be
found here, as in other parts of Palestine.

The Lands of Meal: and Gilead, with the intervening
country, present no very different botanical features from the
last-named districts 5 the centaurea, gladiolus, malvae of dif-
ferent kinds, scorzonera, ranunculus, and pheasant’s eye are
conspicuous among the numerous ﬂowers; butcher’s broom
and cane-brakes abound ; wild roses, myrtles, and bay-trees
