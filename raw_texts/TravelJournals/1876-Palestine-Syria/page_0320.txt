300 SEA or GALILEE.

correct; and we have also the testimony of .Eusebius and
Origen that a village called Gergesa once existed on the
borders of the lake. Perhaps the discrepancy may be ex-
plained by supposing that Gergesa was under the jurisdiction
of Gadara. There do not appear to be any rock-hewn tombs
near Khersa; but the demoniacs may possibly have lived in
one of those tombs built above ground which have been
noticed under the head of Tell- Hum, a form of tomb much
more common in Galilee than has been supposed. I have
entered into this question rather fully, as travellers have
alternately asserted and denied the existence of a suitable
locality on the eastern shore; and even such a carefully com-
piled work as the Dictionary qf the Bible has made the
extraordinary blunder of placing the scene of the miracle at
Gadara, now Um Keis (p. 460), a place from which the
swine would have had a hard gallop of two hours before
reaching the lake.”—(Recovery of jerusalem.)

Just beyond Magdala (left) will be seen the Wady
Hamam (Valley of the Pigeons), descending from Khan
Lub‘iyeh and the Horns of Hattin (p. 290), and a little
further on the ruins of Kul’at Ibn Ma’an, and the once-
strongly fortiﬁed caverns of Arbela, where robbers who were
the terror of the country found a retreat, but were dispossessed
by Herod the Great, who caused them to be attacked by
lowering cages ﬁlled with soldiers ; found to be the only way
to reach them. .

The ruins of Irbid, or Arbela, the Beth—Arbel of
Scripture, are on the north of the plateau of Hattin. The
origin of the name is supposed to be House of Ambush, and
it would seem that from a very early date it was famous as a
stronghold. “Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy
people, and all thy fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman
‘ spoiled Beth-Arbel in the day of battle ” (Hosea 1. I4).
