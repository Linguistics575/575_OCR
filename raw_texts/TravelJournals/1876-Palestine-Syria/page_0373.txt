ENVIRONS 0F DAMASCUS. 353
There are many interesting places to visit in the
Environs of Damascus.

I. TO Johan—The ride is interesting, as the road
passes through very beautiful scenery. Jobar is only a
Muslim village, not much more than two miles outside the
walls. Two or three legends attach to it. F irst, that the
-old synagogue, which has been a Jewish pilgrimage place for
ages, is the spot where Elijah was fed by the ravens (p. 231) ;
next, that Elijah here anointed Hazael to be King of Syria.

matter of individual Opinion. Sélahiyeh has about 7,000
inhabitants, and is a favourite resort of the Damascenes.
At Kasiun, a rocky hill close to Saléh‘iyeh, the Muslims
declare that Abraham bad the unity of God revealed to him;
and Mahomed stood here, and made his celebrated com-
parison of Damascus with Paradise (see below). It is, there-
fore, a pilgrimage place. Close behind are the sterile lime-
stone mountains in the dry and desolate region, than which,
says Stanley, the peaks of Sinai are not more sterile. In
front is the great sea of verdure, “ so that you stand literally
between the living and the dead. And the ruined arches of
