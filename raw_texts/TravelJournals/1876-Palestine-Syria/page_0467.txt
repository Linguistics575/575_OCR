BOZRAH. 447

The Cathedral is square outside, with a circular inte-
rior 5 over the centre is a large dome. It dates from 513 A.D.
It is locally known as the church of the monk Boheira, who
is said to have deserted Christianity and to have become the
accomplice of Mahomed, by supplying the Bible elements of
the Kur-én. _

The Great Mosque is assigned to the Khalif Omar.
The colonnades include seventeen very ﬁne monolith columns
of white marble. Portions of more ancient ediﬁces, some bear-
ing Greek inscriptions have been worked into this erection.

Amongst the remaining attractions of Busrah, must be
brieﬂy mentioned the remains of a Temple, situated where
the two main streets cross. A Triumphal Arch
Spanning the main street, forty feet in height. The so-
called Jew’s house or Beit-el-Yehudy, said to have been
rebuilt by the order of the Caliph Omar, for a Jew whose
house had been wrongfully pulled down to make room for a
mosque. As the story goes, Omar had the mosque pulled
down that justice might be done. The Western Gate called
Bab-el-Hd’wc‘i, “ Gate of the Wind,” is worth a passing notice.
In addition to observing the above, the visitor’s attention
will be constantly attracted as he passes along by columns,
baths, tanks, arches, scattered fragments of capitals and cor-
nices, stones with inscriptions, and various other remains of
the past glories of the ancient city.

Bozrah was taken by Judas Maccabeus (I Macc. v.
26—28).“ During the Eastern conquests of Trajan Bozrah
was made the capital of a Roman province, and named
Nova Trajana Bostra. Alexander Severus made the city a
colony. When Philip of Bostra became Roman Emperor,
he raised his birth-place to the rank of a metropolis. In the
Christian era Bostra was the seat of a Primate, to whom
thirty-three bishops were subject.
