and producing wealth for the towns whose ruins are seen
here and there. As the traveller journeys on, the line of
dark cliﬂ's marking the boundary of the Lejah comes into
view, and .on a nearer approach, the trees and villages and
towers of old cities on the heights are gradually discerned.

The Lejah is an extraordinary elevated region, of a
regular, almost oval shape, measuring about twenty-two
miles from north to south, and about fourteen from west to
east. It has been described as “an ocean of basaltic rocks
and boulders, tossed about in the wildest confusion, and
intermingled with ﬁssures and crevices in every direction.”
Deserted cities and villages, massive in structure and of re-
mote antiquity, thickly stud this wild, forbidding region.
The exploits of Jair in Argob, as this region was termed by
the Hebrews, have been already alluded to (Deut. iii. 13, [4).
The same event is referred to in I Chron. ii. 23. Here, in
after years, dwelt the Geshurites, whom Israel refrained
from exterminating (Joshua xiii. 13), and it was to these
rocky recesses that Absalom ﬂed when he sought his uncle
“in Geshur of Aram,” after the murder of his brother
Ammon (2 Sam. xiii.) At the present day, the Lejah is a
refuge for those ﬂeeing from oppression or danger, as in
times past. Its inhabitants are chieﬂy Bedawins of the
wildest and most predatory type, who are only kept in con-

inscription without their express permission. Otherwise, he
might be suspected by ignorant and superstitious onlookers
to be engaged in magical incantations 5 and in that case
danger to life or limb would inevitably result.
