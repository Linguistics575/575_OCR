Io INTRODUCTORY.

Any person or persons contemplating a Tour to Palestine
including Egypt and elsewhere or not, should make out
a programme, or name the places they wish to visit, and
Messrs. COOK & SON will send them, without delay, a quotation
which will be as low as it is possible the journey can be
accomplished for, and including all charges.

HOTEL COUPONS are issued not only for ,the countries
passed through in reaching the East, but in the East also, and
at such a rate as to ensure economy with every comfort.

It should be remembered that in Palestine and Syria the
only good hotels are at Jaﬁ'a (p. 67), Jerusalem (p. 101),
Damascus (p. 332), and Beyrout (p. 367). While the follow-
ing remarks apply more particularly to hotels 'tO which the
traveller may resort en route to the East, they are also appli-
cable tO hotels in the East for which special coupons are
provided.

The advantages of taking Hotel Coupons may be brieﬂy
summed up as follows :—

1. Time, expense, annoyance in bartering, and ultimate
dissatisfaction, are saved by going tO a well-recommended
Hotel.

11. It is a great drawback tO pleasure tO arrive in a Foreign
town beset by porters and commissionaires and rabble, a perfect
stranger, and without any deﬁnite idea where to go.

III. Letters from home, or telegrams, may be found upon
arrival at the Hotel, thus saving trouble or expense in sending
for them to the Post Ofﬁce or Consulate.

IV. The charges are all ﬁxed, thus obviating the chance Of
imposition, and the disagreeable task Of having to drive a
bargain at each stopping place.

V. The charges being ﬁxed at the lowest sum tO ensure good
accommodation at one uniform rate, the tourist is enabled to
count the cost Of his tour before starting.

VI. Travellers with coupons, bespeaking accommodation by
letter or telegraph, are always provided for even in the busiest
seasons if they inform the hotel-keeper that they have coupons.
