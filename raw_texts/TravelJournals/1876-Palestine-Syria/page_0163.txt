TéUR OF THE CITY. 14.3

The tradition attached to it is that a chain was su5pended
from heaven and stood on this spot, and when two disputants
could not settle a quarrel, the chain moved towards the one
who had the right on his side, and so the litigation would
be settled. Another tradition is that every witness in a great
trial was brought here. If he could grasp the chain, his
evidence was true; if a link broke off, he was a perjurer.
The Kubbet-el-Miraj, or Dome of Ascension, marks
the Spot where Mahomed ascended on his wonderful
journey to heaven.

One very interesting spot between the Dome of the Rock
and El Aksa IS a marble fountain called E1 Kas, or The
Cup, beneath which are vast reservoirs, into which the water
from the Pools of Solomon (p. 202) was conveyed. They are
hewn in the solid rock, and are approached by a staircase, also
hewn in the rock. Was it here that Solomon placed the
Brazen Laver? The cisterns are called the Cistems of the Sea,
or the King’s Cistems. Solomon “made a molten sea, of ten
cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and four cubits
the height thereof. . . . . And the thickness of it was
an hand breadth, and the brim of it like the work of a brim ‘
of a cup . . . . . and it received and held three thou-
sand baths” (2. Chron. iv. 1—.- 5).

WITHIN TH E CITY.

[In Jerusalem, the places of interest are so close together
that it is almost unnecessary to indicate any special “walks,”
as the traveller will in all probability stroll on from place to
place, and ﬁnd that in a few such strolls he has compassed
the city and its sights. For the sake of those who wish to
make a systematic tour of the city, the following descriptions
are given in the order in which they may be visited with the
least trouble and loss of time]
