towards Jericho; the passage of Elijah, and Elisha, who
came from Jericho; the baptism of our Lord, who was led
up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the
devil ”—all occurred in nearly an identical locality. Tra-
dition has placed them at the Pilgrims’ Bathing
Place. Dr. Tristram places the departure of Elijah, the
preaching of the Baptist, and the Baptism of our Lord, at
the Upper Ford, known as the Ford of Nimrim (i.e., of the
Leopards), the name being identical with Beth-nimrah (the
House of the Leopard), a town “int he valley ” (Joshua xiii.
27), fortiﬁed by Gad (Num. xxxii. 36), and called Nimrah
in Num. xxxii. 3. “The waters of Nimrim” (Isa. xv. ‘
6 5 Jer. xlviii. 34) are considered to be in the same locality.
The name lives in its present form of Nahr-nimrin, at
the lower end of the Wady Shai'b. The city must once
have been important, for it commanded the great thorough-
fare from Judaea and the south of Gilead. Hence, the
ancient road led up to Ramoth Gilead. By the Wady
Shai'b must have passed all the commerce between Jericho
and Ammon, as well as Gilead. It was the ordinary place
of passage for those who travelled from Galilee to Jerusalem
by the Jordan route.” In the Septuagint version Beth-
N imrah is named as identical with Bethabara, Where John
baptized. “ Fords do not change in a river like the Jordan ;
roads are never altered in the East; and this must always
have been, as it is now, the place of passage from Jericho
to Gilead . . . . the Lower Ford was only used for
the passage to Moab.” (Tristram) (See p. 4.49).

At Easter, the bathing-place of the Greeks is the resort
of thousands of pilgrims, who come in a body from Jeru-
salem to Jericho, and assemble in multitudes in the neigh-
bourhood of Riba (p. 231). Early in the morning, at a given
signal, the pilgrims leave their resting-place and proceed
