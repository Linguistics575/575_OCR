Soon after leaving the ruins, the Quarries, from whence
the great stones used for the platform of the Temple of the
'Sun were excavated, ’are passed. There is one gigantic stone
still lying where it was left by the Phoenician workmen 4,000
years ago. It is 68 ft. long, I4 high, and I4. broad. It is
estimated that it weighs nearly moo tons.

Our course now lies over the Buka’a, the broad valley
between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon, which we cross dia-
gonally, and observe one or two ruins on the right, scarcely
worth the trouble of visiting.

The valley looks smooth, level, and well cultivated; but
after rains it is difﬁcult riding, as there are so many swampy
places. The journey will be broken for mid-day rest and
lunch at the village at Kerak Nﬁh, where there is the
reputed tomb of Noah, which measures between ﬁfty and
sixty yards in length! It is probably a disused aqueduct.
Near here is a village, very beautiful for situation, called
Nur ’Allaka, surrounded by groves and orchards, and in
the midst of fertility.

Zahleh is a large town, the largest in Lebanon, with a

population of nearly sixteen thousand, of wh0m more than ,

' nine-tenths are Christians. There is an air of comfort and
cleanliness about the place, and intelligence among the
people, more than is met with elsewhere.

A good wine is grown in the neighbourhood, and there
are many thriving manufactories. -

Through the steep streets there is a watercourse, in which
babbles a brook descending from the Sann’in, a mountain
hard by. During the massacre of 1860 the town suffered
terribly, and was captured by the Druses, who burnt it to
the ground.

In less than an hour from here we reach Shtora, where
we join the diligence route (p. ' 3 56).
