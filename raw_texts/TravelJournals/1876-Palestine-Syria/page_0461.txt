SUWEIDEH. 44 I

in the side of the cliff. Near it is a small Temple. A
winding staircase conducts to a castle on the summit of the
cliff, reared with huge stones, and of very ancient date.
The ornamented panels, fretted mouldings, and sculptured
wreaths of the inner stone doors are very ﬁne. Hard by is
an ancient circular tower of colossal masonry. The view

Kunawét is the Kenath of the Old Testament, one of

An hour’s ride brings the traveller to the Wady Suweideh

city. On the north bank, before crossing the Wady, a re-
