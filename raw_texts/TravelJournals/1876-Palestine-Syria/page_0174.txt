154, JERUSALEM.

Continuing a short distance north, the Street of David is
reached, and turning to the left it leads straight to the Jaﬁ'a
Gate, from whence we started.

From the Wailing Place, if so minded, the traveller may
make a Tour of the Walls of the Haram.

The ﬁrst place of interest is but a step or two beyond
David Street, and is known as

Wilson’s Arch. This arch springs from a wall which
seems to be a continuation of the wall at the Jews’ Wailing
Place. Beneath the accumulated soil at the bottom has been
found a good piece of pavement. The wall has been
cemented at the joints of the stones, for twelve feet and
upwards, to make a chamber within it serve as a cistern. It
was supposed that this arch was a viaduct running parallel
to Robinson’s Arch, connecting, perhaps, the Temple and the
south-west of the city at this more northern point. But the
complete researches of captain Warren have dispelled this
supposition ; he pronounces it to be modern. If his theory
is correct, Wilson’s Arch did not exist in Old or New Testa-
ment times, and cannot therefore be connected with SCripture
scenes; but it might have been connected with the Christian
buildings of the Haram executed in the days of Justinian
(p. I 38). The chamber, however, to which reference has
been made, and which is designated by Captain Warren the
“ Masonic Hall,” has walls of square stones, and pilasters
. with capitals in the corners, also entrances with jambs and
lintels, and he says has “ every appearance of being the oldest
piece of masonry visible in Jerusalem with the exception of
the Sanctuary walls, and perhaps as old as they.” Here at
least there is a connection with early Biblical scenes.

In connection with both Robinson’s and Wilson’s Arches
there exist relics of roads. One, the more ancient, con-
sists of hard, well-squared marble paving stones, on the south-
