LEBANON AND THE CEDARS. 375

used, jebel-eth-leelj. The highest mountains in all parts
of the world have a similar signiﬁcation.

The Bible represents Lebanon as lying on the northern
border of the Promised Land (Deuteronomy i. 7, iii. 2 5,
xi. 245 Joshua i. 4, ix. 1). The two distinct ranges both
begin in latitude 33 degrees 20 minutes, and run in parallel
lines from south-west to - north-east for about one hundred
miles, with an average base breadth of about twenty miles.
At the northernmost termination of the chain, the plain of
Emesa opens out, which is “the entering in of Hamath,”
so often mentioned as the extreme limit, in this direction, of
the widest possible inheritance of Israel (Numbers xiii. 21 5
2 Kings xiv. 25 ; 2 Chronicles vii. 8, etc.) Between these
two ranges is the long nariow valley, from ﬁve to eight miles
in width, called Cale-Syria (“ Hollow Syria”), termed in
Scripture the “Valley of Lebanon” (Joshua ii. 17). The
modern name is El-Buka’a, “the valley.” This is a northern
prolongation of the Jordan Valley, and a southern prolonga-
tion of that of the Orontes.

Besides the above passages, which mainly refer to the
name and situation, there are many other Bible allusions to
this vast mountain range. Lebanon and its inhabitants, the
Giblites and Hivites, were promised to Israel5 but a great
part of the region was not conquered (Joshua xiii. 2—65
Judges iii. 1—4). InfDeuteronomy iii. 2 5, it is called “that
goodly mountain ” which Moses desired to see; in Judges
iii. 3, “ Mount Lebanon ”5 in 2 Chronicles ii. 2, “the moun-
tain ”5 “the Tower of Lebanon,” Solomon’s Song, vii. 45
this goodly mountain was famous for cedars, Psalms xxix.
5, xcii. 12, Isaiah xiv. 8 5 for ﬂowers, Nahum i. 4 5 for
fragrance, Solomon’s Song iv. 11, Hosea xiv. 6 5 for wine,
Hosea xiv. 7 5 for appearance, “ the glory of Lebanon,"
Isaiah xxxv. 2 5 Lebanon was covered with snow, Jeremiah
