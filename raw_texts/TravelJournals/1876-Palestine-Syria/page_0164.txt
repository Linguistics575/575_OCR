r 44 JERUSALEM.

Start from the Jaﬂ'a Gate for Bab-el-Khulil (i.e., The
Gate of Hebron, or The Friend, p. 208). This is on the
west side of the city, close to the north-western angle of
the citadel. It consists of a massive square tower, the
entrance to which from without is on the northern side, and
'the exit within on the eastern. Entering Jerusalem by this
gate, a large open space is reached, where a kind of fair is
always going on ; vendors of fruit and sweetmeats vieing with
dealers in more substantial articles of food. On the left is a
line of shops, cafés, etc., and on the right is the Tower of
Dav id, called by Josephus the Tower of Hippicus, and
forming part of the citadel, a strong and conspicuous struc-
ture. The upper part of this tower has been often rebuilt;
but the town is evidently ancient,'the stones being of im-
mense size, and bevelled after the manner of the Jews. Here
David erected a fortress which was the stronghold of Zion in
all after ages; and it is probable that these immense stones
belong to the earliest period of its history, and may have been
laid by David. If it be the Tower of David, or the Tower
of Hippicus, built by Herod, or both, it was standing here
when our Saviour was a visitor in Jerusalem, and His shadow
may have rested upon it as He walked in Zion. Josephus
says that Titus, when he destroyed Jerusalem, left the three
Towers built by Herod standing ; the two others were called
Phasaelis and Mariamme, and have since been destroyed. The
Tower of Hippicus remains, and many travellers regard it as
one of the most interesting places in Jerusalem. “ There is
not one house standing on which we can feel certain that
our Lord ever gazed, unless it be the old Tower at the
Jaﬂ‘a Gate.”—(MacLeod.)

There is a ﬁne view from the top.

Zion Street passes by the east side of the tower, running
north and south. We follow it south to the Gate of David,
