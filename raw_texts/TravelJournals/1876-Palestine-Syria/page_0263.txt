RAMAH or BENJAMIN. 243

of his reign (1 Sam. x. 26, xiv. 2.). This is the place where
the seven descendants of Saul were hanged by the Amorites,
and the scene of one of the most touching stories of motherly
love on record. Two of her sons were amongst those who
were thus slain, and they “ were put to death in the days of
harvest, in the ﬁrst days in the beginning of barley harvest.
And Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, took sackcloth, and spread
it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until
water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered
neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the
beasts of the ﬁeld by night” (2. Sam. xxi. 10). Thus, for
six months, and those the hottest of the year, the sorrowing
woman watched the bodies of her sons, and proved the truth
of the saying, “love is stronger than death.” The site of
the city is now a dreary and desolate waste, and the ruins
are not of importance.

The next site (if any interest on the road is a hill on the
right, where is the village of El-Rﬁ,m, identical with Ramah
of Benj amin—from whence there is a ﬁne view. It was
between Gibeon and Beeroth (Joshua xviii. 2.5). Here was
the scene of that terrible story of the Levite (Judges xix.)
which brought about the great war with the Benjamites. It
is not improbable that here was fulﬁlled the prophecy, “ A
voiCe was heard in Rama, lamentation and bitter weeping” '
(Jer. xxxi. 15 3 Matt. ii. 17,18). It requires a little Special
pleading to make this a proven site, as Ramah simply means
a highplace, or height.

Proceeding on our journey, we pass a ruined village on
the ridge of a hill, supposed to be the site of Ataroth-addar,
on the borders of Benjamin and Ephraim (Joshua xvi. 5). In
a little more than half an hour we reach El-Bireh, a village
with about Boo inhabitants, an excellent Spring of water,
ruins of reservoirs, and of an old khan .
