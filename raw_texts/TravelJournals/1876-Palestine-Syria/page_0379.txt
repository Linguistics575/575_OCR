BA’ALBEK. 3 59

cultivated and in the village of Zebedﬁny, which has a
population of over three thousand, there is an abundance of
trees and gardens, richer in their profusion than the traveller
will have seen anywhere else in Syria.

The village on the high hill above Zebedény is Blﬁdﬁn,
the summer residence of the Damascus British Consul, and
other people of importance. Crossing the watershed between
Damascus and Buka’a by a series of zig-zags, we arrive at
Surghaya, a village nestling under the highest peak of
Anti-Lebanon. This is a ‘favourite camping-place 5 the
villagers are simple and pleasant, and some of their houses
scrupulously clean; there are no remarkable antiquities in
the neighbourhood except some rock tombs. Next morning
the journey will be continued through a rugged country.
There is a choice of three roads, the pleasantest being that
by way of the village of Yahfﬁfeh and Neby Shit, supposed
to be the tomb of Seth. His sepulchre is 121 ft. long! From
these villages the view of the whole range of Lebanon, a
mighty wall of dazzling snow, with the richly-cultivated plain
of Buka’a below, is grand beyond description. The hill-sides
are curious for the varied colouring they exhibit, ranging from
pale slate to red. With exquisite views all around us, we
continue until we reach the village of Bereit'én, supposed
to be Berothai, a city of Hadadezer, from which “King
David took exceeding much brass” (28am. viii. 8). In about
an hour after leaving this village, the ruins “of Ba’albek are
visible.

[It is usual for the camp to be pitched in the court of the
Great Temple, where it presents a curiously-picturesque
effect. Travellers without tents may obtain a shake-down
in some of the houses of the village close at hand, but the
accommodation is wretchedly poor.]
