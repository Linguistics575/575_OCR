to be the place where she sat when search was being made
for the true cross.

Descending thirteen steps more we reach the Chapel
of the Finding of the Cross. The legend will be
remembered of how the Empress was divinely directed to
' this spot; how she watched the digging until eventually the
three crosses, with nails, crown of thorns, superscription,
and other relics were found. How it was difﬁcult to ascer-

Greek Church, larger and more gorgeously decorated
than the chapels of any of the other sects. Here is the seat
of the patriarch, and reserved places for other dignitaries of
the Church (p. 65). In the centre of the marble pavement
