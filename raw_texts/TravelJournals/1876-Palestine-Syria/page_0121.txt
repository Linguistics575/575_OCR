JERUSALEM. 10,

31mm aim.

(Hotel Mediterranean, near the Jaﬂ‘a Gate.)

(Formerly the camps of Messrs. T. COOK & SON were pitched
outside the Jaffa Gate, but as travellers always like to make a long stay
in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, and in case of bad weather camp
life in one locality is not agreeable, they have made arrangements for
their travellers to stay at the Mediterranean Hotel, the best in Jerusalem.
When that Hotel is full, travellers are sent to the Hotel de l’Europe,
both houses being under the proprietorship of the Brothers Hornstein.

Messrs. COOK & SON have also secured a large new house, with
two immense water-cistems of great value, and land suﬂicient for a
large private camp. As a dep6t for stores and camping equipments,
and to afford shelter for horses, they have now most excellent provision
at Jerusalem, within less than ﬁve minutes’ walk from the Jaﬂ'a Gate.)

For independent travellers there are several places where fair
accommodation can be obtained, either at Hotels, in Apartments, or
in the Hospices.

Bankers.-—Mr. Bergheim, of Christian Street, is a
well-known and much—patronized banker and money-
changer. There is a Branch of the Ottoman Bank here
(Messrs. Frutiger and 00., near the Jaﬁ'a Gate).

Consulates—The British Consul, Noel Temple Moore,
Esq., is known by every Palestine traveller for his courteous
attention and his willingness to impart practical advice in
case of need. The American Consul is Dr. de Hass, who has
only recently been appointed to the ofﬁce. There are also
in Jerusalem French, German, Italian, and Russian Con-
sulates.

Those who wish to visit the Mosques must obtain the
requisite permit from one of the Consulates.
