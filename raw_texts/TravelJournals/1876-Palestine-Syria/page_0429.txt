MOUNT CARMEL. 409

Mount Carmel is about 1,800 ft. where it overlooks the
sea, and about 600 ft. at its inland extremity.

From Haifa a steep climb conducts to the summit of the
mountain. “ The View from here," says Warburton, “is
very grand, but somewhat saddening, from the loneliness

others describe its “ rocky dells with deep jungles of c0pse,"
its “ shrubberies thicker than any other in Central Palestine,”

who can stay a night, or even two, at the Convent on the
mountain will see more than those who hurriedly visit from
Haifa, and return there the same day. .

The Convent, which is grandly situated, is a large
building of very simple style, in two stories, and surmounted
by a dome. The fathers exercise hospitality towards
strangers,but it is of course right to leave a donation covering
all expenses. The mountain seems, from earliest times, to
