water-courses on arches, of which the piers may still be seen ;
it then turns down towards the lake, and runs along the
hillside on the top of a massive retaining-wall, of which ﬁfty
or sixty yards remain, and lastly passes round the Khan
Minyeh cliff, by a remarkable excavation in the solid rock,
which has been noticed by all travellers. The elevation of
the aqueduct at this point is sufﬁcient to have enabled the
water brought by it to irrigate the whole plain of Genne-
sareth; and though we could only trace it for a few hundred
yards inland, it was not improbably carried right round the
head of the plain. The same causes which have almost obli-
terated it in the small plain of Tabigah, would fully account for
its disappearance at Gennesareth.”—~—( Recovery querusalem.)

Tell—Hum is two miles west of the Jordan. It is a
mass of ruins, in the early summer overgrown with tall,
coarse thistles, which hide them from view.

The principal ruins are those of the “ White Synagogue,”
as it has been called on account of its having been built of
white limestone; it was 74. ft. 9 in. long, by 56 ft. 9 in. wide.
Connected with this are the ruins of an older building,
supposed to be the remains of a Basilica enclosing the house
of St. Peter, described by Antoninus A.D. 600. Captain
Wilson says of the former of these buildings, “ If Tell-Hum
be Capernaum, this is without a doubt the synagogue built
by the Roman centurion (Luke vii. 4, 5), and one of the
most sacred places on earth. It was in this building that our
Lord gave the well-known discourse in John vi.” [on the
Bread of Life—“ These things said He in the synagogue, as
he taught in Capernaum ” (verse 59)] ; and it was not with-
out a certain strange feeling that on turning over a large
block we found the pot of manna engraved on its face, and
remembered the words, ‘I am that bread of life. Your
fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.’ ”
