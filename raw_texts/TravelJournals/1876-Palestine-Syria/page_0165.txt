THE TOMB OF DAVID. 145

or Zion Gate, on the summit of the ridge of Zion. This
height was held by the Jebusites until David took it by
storm, and “ David dwelt in the Fort, and called it the City
of David ” (2 Sam. v. 9). It was the highest point within
the limits of the city, being 254.0 ft. above the Mediterranean.
Here, or hereabouts, David’s house was built, the household
for his families was here, and here was the place for.the
Ark of God before the Temple was built. “ And David
made. him houses in the City of David, and prepared a place
for the Ark of God, and pitched for it a tent ” (1 Chron.
xv. I, 29; 2. ’Chron. v. 2, etc.) Opposite the gate is the
Armenian Convent, one of the richest and largest in the
city, with several large tamarisk-trees in front, said to have
been planted by Herod. Within the Convent is the Church
of St. James, the place where, according to tradition,
St. James was beheaded. “ Herod the king stretched forth
his hands to vex certain of the church, and he killed James,
the brother of John, with the sword " (Acts xii. 2). The
convent is capable of accommodating about 3000 people.
The monks are industrious, and are adepts in all kinds of
trade. They have in the convent a printing-press, a photo-
graphic establishment, carpenters’ shops, etc.

Just outside Zion Gate is a modern ruin called the
Palace of Caiaphas. It contains the tombs of the
Armenian patriarchs. According to tradition, the prison of
Christ is here, and the stone which was rolled away from
the mouth of the sepulchre (see p. 125). It is also the place
where Peter stood when he denied the Lord; and a small
pillar is shown on which the cock stood when he crew to
warn him!

A little south of this ruin is a small mosque, known as
Neby Dadd, or The Tomb of David. It cannot well
be doubted that this memorial marks the place, or at least

I.)
