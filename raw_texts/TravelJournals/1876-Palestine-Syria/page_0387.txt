BEYROUT. . 367

It is usual to camp somewhere by the road-side, or at
Shtéra, and resume the journey on the following morning.

A good road, gently winding, leads by a series of. zig-zags
to the summit of Lebanon, and then descends by another
series of zig-zags to Beyrout.

A When the Summit of Lebanon is reached, the scenery
is exquisite. On our right-hand is a wild, magniﬁcent gorge,
the Wady Hummana; below, at a terrible depth, may be
seen the promontory of Beyrout, ﬂecked with its white
houses, while beyond is the broad blue Mediterranean; in
the background on the right and left are wild and barren
mountains. The traveller should stay here awhile at 3,115
Wondrous summit, 5,600 ft. above the sea level, until 13 has
fully taken in the magniﬁcence of the scene. y

Descending towards Beyrout, every turn ,f the road
gives fresh glimpSes of Beyrout and its charming env‘n‘Uns.
As we clear the level' a civilized region is entered, orchards
and gardens abound, pleasant villas are seen on every hand, the
Pineta, or pine-grove, is traversed, and soon we ﬁnd ourselves
among the shops and paved streets of Beyrout.

[Beyrout is the principal commercial town of Syria, and is
strangely different from any other. Bankers abound;
there are Consulates of all the principal countries
in the world. Almost everything that can be purchased
in a European city may be purchased in Beyrout, and
souvenirs of Arab work may be bought to advantage.
At the hotels, vendors of photographs, worked slippers,
and other things, are persistent in their endeavours to
effect a sale; but the traveller‘willjdo better, as a rule,
to make a bargain at the shops.
