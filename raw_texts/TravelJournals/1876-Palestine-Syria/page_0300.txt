2,30 NAZARE‘I‘H.

French had evacuated; his bloodthirsty scheme, however,
was thwarted by Sir Sidney Smith, the English Admiral. '

It is very diﬂicult to arrive at a correct estimate of the
population of any place under Turkish rule. It has been
recently asserted that there are in Nazareth ten thousand
souls 3 others make it to be not more than four thousand.
The correct estimate will probably be about ﬁve to six
thousand. Of these, certainly more than half belong to the
orthodox Greek Church; then follow United Greeks, Latins,
Protestants, Maronites, and various other Christian com-
munities, making up four-ﬁfths of the population, the rest
being Muslims.*

Nazareth is still, as probably it was at the time of the
angel’s visit, a large village or small town, situated upon the
slope of one of the hills which enclose a hollow or valley.
This vale, which is about a mile long by half-a-mile broad,
resembles a circular basin shut in by mountains. It is a
pleasant Spot, and one might almost think that the ﬁfteen
mountains which enclose it had risen around to guard it
from intrusion. It is as a rich and beautiful ﬁeld in the
midst of barren mountains, abounding in fig-trees, and show-
ing many small gardens with hedges of the prickly pear,
while the rich, dense grass aﬁords an abundant and refresh-
ing pasture. The town stands at the left, or western, end
of the vale, and commands a view over the whole of its
beautiful extent. The town itself, as beheld from the
valley or from the enclosing hill, is very picturesque, backed
as it is by high cliffs, and approached from under the shade
of spreading oaks; with substantial-looking houses of stone,
the square, massive walls of the church and monastery, and

than six hundred ; others give it as over two thousand. We have no‘
means of ascertaining positively which is correct—ED.
