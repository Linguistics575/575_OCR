sometimes without the article, as in Isaiah xiv, 8, and Psalm
xxix. 5 and 6. In Greek, both in the Septuagint and classic
authors, the name is Libanus ; sometimes the Septuagint has
Anti-Libanus, the reason for which does not appear (Deut.
i. 7, iii. 25 5 Joshua i. 4,, ix. l). The classic Latin name,
as well as the reading of the Vulgate, is Libanus; Arab
geographers call the range 7906i Libm’in; but when the
Syrians use the term (which is seldom) it refers to the
western range. The northern section is called Jebel
Akkéir, the central, Sunni'n, and the southern, jewel-el-
Druze.

There are also other modern local names. In Joshua
i. 4 (as elsewhere) Lebanon includes both the eastern and the
western mountain ranges, while in Joshua xiii. 5, the
eastern range is appropriately distinguished as “Lebanon
towards the sun-rising.” Latin writers always designate
the eastern range by‘the name Anti-Libanus, which signiﬁes
Opposite, or “over against Lebanon.” The southern section
of this range is known to the sacred writers as Hermon
(“The Lofty Peak ”l. Anti—Libanus is now called by native
geographers 7eéel-esh-Shurlzy, (“East Mountain,”) while
Lebanon proper is sometimes termed febel-el- Ghurl'y (“ West
Mountain ”). .

Lebanon signiﬁes “white,” “the White Mountain ” of
Syria in ancient times; the mountain of the “Old White-
Headed Man,” or the “Mountain of Ice,” in modern times.
The term white is employed either because of the whitish
limestone rock which composes the great body of the whole
range, or, more probably, because snow covers the peaks
most of the year. In Jeremiah xxvii. 14, mention is made
of the “ snow of Lebanon ”5 and in the Chaldee paraphrase
the name of Lebanon is “Snow Mountain,” which is
synonymous with a modern Arabic appellation sometimes
