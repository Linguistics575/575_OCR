desideratum. There is “ The Rothschild Hospital,” founded
in. 185 5, which has done much good service. Sir Moses
Monteﬁore’s mission has been to assist the Jews, not by
indiscriminate charity, but by giving them means and scope
for labour. In January, 187 5, being in the gist year of his
age, he resigned his position as President of the Board of
Deputies of British Jews, and a testimonial to him having
been resolved upon, he requested it might take the form of a
scheme for improving the condition of the Jews in Palestine
generally, and Jerusalem particularly. About £ I 1,000 only
has been as yet contributed to the fund, although the amount
anticipated was £200,000. The reason of the smallness of
the contributions was that a rumour went abroad that the
scheme was only to continue idle Jews in idleness. Sir
Moses Monteﬁore, at the age of ninety-two, went to Jeru-
salem, in company with Dr. Lowe, to investigate the real
state of the Jewish community. He considers the people
are eager, and physically able, to work—:that they have only
lacked opportunity, and states that they are “ more industrious
than many men even in Eur0pe, otherwise none of them
would remain alive.” He proposes colleges, public schools,
houses with plots of ground for cultivation, etc., and pro?-
ceedings are in progress to purchase land and build houses
for this purpose, in and around Jerusalem. It is to the
young that this will be a special boon, the habits of the older
members of the community being too deep rooted to allow
them to fall at once into the radical changes proposed. The
express object of the “ Monteﬁore Testimonial Fund ” is
“the encouragement of agriculture, and' other mechanical
employments, among the Jews of Palestine.”

There are several institutions already in efﬁcient working
order for the Jews in Jerusalem—The House of Industry,
Girls’ Work School, etc.
