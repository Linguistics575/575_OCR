HEALTH —— POSTAGE. 5

East to protect the neck and head with a good broad-brimmed
hat, and ﬂowing puggerie, as sunstrokes are not uncommon.

OPHTHALMIA is exceedingly prevalent in Egypt, and to
some extent in Palestine. Some consider that it is produced
by the ﬁne dust-sand wafted from the deserts, and the glare of
the sun. It is more probable, however, that it is to be attri-
buted to other causes, such as damp night air. The ﬁrst remedy
to apply is constant washing of the eyes with warm water; if
this is not successful, zinc lotion must be resorted to, or a solution
of nitrate of silver.
' All travellers will do well to take special precautions to avoid
exposure to damp, or cold night air. _

If any MEDICINES are taken, the traveller should select those
to which he is accustomed. In addition, it may be well to cal
attention to the following :—

Quinine; the best thing for intermittent fever.

Zinc eye-wash.

Pyretic Saline; or,

Seidlitz powders.

’ A roll of sticking plaister.

A bottle of chlorodyne.

A pot of cold-cream.

Eau-de-Cologne,
and any speciality that the traveller may be in the habit of
using, such as Bunter’s Nervine, for tooth-ache, etc.

EUROPEAN PHYSICIANS may be met with in Jerusalem (p.
