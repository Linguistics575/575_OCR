It is an interesting fact, that the word “ Kady ” in Arabic
corre5ponds exactly with “ Dan ” in Hebrew, and means a
judge._ In the blessing given by Jacob to his sons, this is
the portion of Dan. “ Dan shall judge his pe0ple, as one of
the tribes of Israel. Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an
adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider
shall fall backward. I have waited for thy salvation, O

carpet of turf—through trees of every variety of foliage—
through a park-like verdure, which casts a strangely beautiful
interest over this last recess of Palestine, the pathway winds,
and the snowy top of the mountain itself is gradually shut
out from view by its increasing nearness; and again there,
is the rush of waters through deep thickets, and the ruins of
an ancient town—not Canaanite, but Roman—rise on the hill-
side ; in its situation, in its exuberance of water, its olive-groves,
and its views over the distant plain, almost a Syrian Tivoli.”
