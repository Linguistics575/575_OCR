LACHISH. 393

In 2 Kings xviii. 13—17, xix. 8; 2 Chron. xxxii. 9;
Isa. xxxvi. 7. xxxvii. 8, references are made to the siege
(and probably the capture) of this town by Sennacherib,
King of Assyria. A reference to this event, in cuneiform
characters, has been discovered at Nineveh. Over the ﬁgure
of Sennacherib are the words, “ Sennacherib the mighty

“spread the letter before the Lord; ” deliverance was
promised, and speedily sent. “ It came to pass that night
that the Angel of the Lord went out and smote in the
camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and ﬁve
thousand.”

“ Like the leaves of the forest when summer is green,
That host with their banners at sunset were seen ;
Like the leaves of the forest when autumn hath blown,
That host on the morrow lay withered and strewn.

“ For the angel of death spread his wings on the blast,
And but breathed in the face of each foe as he passed,
And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,
And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever were still.”

There are further allusions to Lachish in Jer. xxxiv. 7
Micah i. 13; and Neh. xi. 3o.

“ From Lachish,” treading in the footsteps of Joshua,
the traveller passes “ on to Eglon.” It was taken by Joshua
“ on the same day " with Lachish (Joshua x. 34., 3 5). It is
