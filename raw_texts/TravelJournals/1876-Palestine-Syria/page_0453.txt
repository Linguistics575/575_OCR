BURAK. 433

and is so built on the rocks and encompassed by them, as to
form a natural fortress. Its name signiﬁes “Cisterns;”
these large cisterns, with the aqueduct in connection, are in
existence. It is thought that the town may have accommo-
dated six thousand inhabitants. There are no large build-
ings, but a large number of houses in wonderful perfection
and of great antiquity. There are two or three Greek in-
scriptions of the fourth century B. c. ., but these throw no
light on the erection of the ediﬁces.

The houses in Burak are such as will be found in most
of the Hauran cities. Immense blocks of hewn stone form
the walls, often ﬁve feet in thickness. Long thick slabs
of stone rest upon projecting cornices, and form the roof.
The very doors are of massive stone, with pivots working
in sockets above and below. Such are the deserted habi-
tations found in thousands in the desolate cities of Bashan.
The wandering Arabs prefer dwelling in their tents to
occupying these houses, and the traveller can take possession
of any house he fancies for the night, and apportion the
rooms at pleasure, to himself, his horses, and his attendants.

An old Roman road runs to the Wady Liwa, and then
along the eastern bank of the valley to Jebel Hauran, passing
about a score of desolate towns similar to Burak.

The road now taken does not follow the abovemamed
route, but proceeds south-west, along the Lulgf (“ cover-
ings ”), a narrow strip of the surrounding plain, contiguous
to the Lejah. During this part of the journey, the wonderful
conformation of the Le jah can be examined. The surface
consists of a vast mass of basalt, evidently forced upwards
by volcanic agency, when in a melted condition. The
gradual cooling of the mass must have gone on under
disturbing inﬂuences of a most extraordinary character, so
that there is now a wilderness of rifted rocks, and yawning
