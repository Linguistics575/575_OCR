302 SEA OF GALILEE.

Biblical Allusions and Events.-—The Sea of

is upon the sea-coast, in the borders of Zabulon and N eph-
thalim : that it might be fulﬁlled which was spoken by

of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee
of the Gentiles; the people which sat in darkness saw great
light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of
death light is Sprung up ” (Matt. iv. 13—16). Here He called
Peter, James, and John, the three most intimate disciples,
