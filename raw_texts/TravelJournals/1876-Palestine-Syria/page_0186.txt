1 66 JERUSALEM.

“ There is something in the scenery of this valley and
the hill above it; its tombs hewn in the rock, long since
tenantless 3 the grey gloom of its old ﬁg and olive-trees
starting from the ﬁssures of the crags 5 the overhanging
wall of Zion, desolate almost as in the time of her captivity,
that forcibly recalls the wild and mournful grandeur of the
prophetic writings. Within it, too, is the traditionary
Aceldama, or Field of Blood of the traitor Judas; a
small plot of ground, overhung with one precipice and look-
ing down another into the glen below, on which is a deep
charnel-house, into which it was formerly the custom to
throw the bodies of the dead, as the earth was supposed to
have the power of rapidly consuming them. The place was
selected as the burial-place of pilgrims who died at Jeru-
salem in the Middle Ages. Such are the scenes that have
passed in Hinnom; it is like the scroll of the prophet,
‘ written within and without with mourning, lamentation,
and woe.’ ”—(Bartlett’s Walks about j‘erusalem.)

Aceldama is on the southern face of the valley at the
eastern end. There is, however, no historical proof of this
being identical with the “ Potters’ Field,” and it is known
that various sites have, at different times, been pointed out as
the spot where Judas met his death. When the traitor took
back the thirty pieces of silver, and “ cast them down in the
Temple, and went and hanged himself, the chief priests took
the silver and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the
treasury, because it is the price of blood. And they took
counsel, and bonght with them the Potters’ Field, to bury
strangers in, wherefore that ﬁeld was called The Field of
Blood unto this day ” (Matt. xxvii. 3—10; Acts i. 18, 19).

There are many tombs all round about, some of them
of hermits, who dwelt here in very early times; some
of Crusaders, and some of recent date. Many of the tombs
