BIBLE ASSOCIATIONS.

The allusions to Bethlehem in the Scriptures are very
numerous. It is sometimes spoken of as Ephrath, or
Bethlehem-Ephratha, a Hebrew term expressive of the fruit-
fulness of the locality. This fruitfulness, especially in con-
trast with the barren wilderness of Judaea, almost in sight,
is still remarkable.

The ﬁrst mention of the place is when the favourite wife
of Jacob died after giving birth to the child whom She named
Benoni (Son of my sorrow), but whom Jacob named Ben-
jamin (Son of my right hand). “And Rachel died, and
was buried in the way to Ephrath, Which is Bethlehem ”
(Gen. xxv. 19) (p. 186).

The scenery of the pastoral story of Ruth is laid in
Bethlehem and the surrounding ﬁelds. The return of deso-
late Naomi, the interview of Boaz and the fair Moabitess in
the harvest-ﬁeld, the quaint procedure in the city gate in ful-
ﬁlment of Mosaic law—all happened here. And here Ruth
became the wife of Boaz—the mother of Judah’s Kings and
the World’s Redeemer (p. 192).

The next event of importance in connection with Beth-
lehem is the anointing of David by Samuel to be King of
Israel (1 Sam. xvi. 13). In the adjacent hill country, the
shepherd boy, the great-grandson of Ruth, had spent his
youth in tending sheep; there he had encountered wild
beasts (1 Sam. xvii. 37), and composed his earliest Psalms.
From Bethlehem he was sent for by Saul, to “ minister to a
mind diseased ” with his melodious harpings (1 Sam.
