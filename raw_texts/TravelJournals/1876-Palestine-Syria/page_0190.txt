I 70 JERUSALEM.

blocked up with stones, thrown in, according to an Arab
fashion, of execrating the memory of David's ungrateful son ;
and by the same means a sepulchral cavern behind, styled
the tomb of Jehoshaphat, is hidden from view. The date of
these structures is unknown. Their architecture, however,
indicates that they belong to the period of the Roman occu-
pation of Judaea. N 0 one can reasonably suppose that the
tomb which bears his name is identical with the pillar of
Absalom’s grave, in the King’s Dale. Still, it is not impos-
sible that it may stand on or near the site of that memorial ;
for by the King’s Dale probably is meant the valley in
which this remarkable structure is placed.

THE MOUNT 0F OLIVES.

Those who have made the tour thus far can continue by
foot-path beyond the Pillar of Absalom, up the Mount of
Olives, and near the tap turn to the right a few steps, and
visit the Tombs of the Prophets. They are on the
western part of the Mount of Olives, and constitute cata-
combs, winding in a semicircular form, with numerous
loculi on the sides. Probably the catacombs here were at
ﬁrst natural, and were then extended and adapted by art,
and, like some of the catacombs at Rome, they have been
left In an unﬁnished state. The place must have been dis-
used before completed, and is perhaps of comparatively
modern date; still, it appears to be essentially Jewish in its
arrangements. It has no sarcophagi, or shallow loculi, nor
any architectural mouldings. Indeed, it has nothing to
indicate a foreign origin.

We do not propose to detail here every traditional site on
the Mount of Olives, the holiest of all holy places round
about Jerusalem.
