458 TOURS EAST OF THE JORDAN.

The Turkish Government maintain a garrison in the
citadel of Es-Salt, for the preservation of order in the sur—
rounding districts. Respecting this policy Mr. Tristrarn
writes as follows :—

“ Es-Salt shows what may be done by securing a settled
government, even though it be a Turkish one. When I
visited Es-Salt eight years ago, it was much in the same
state as Kerak is now, and life and property were insecure
in the whole of Gilead. The difﬁculties to travellers were as
great as in Southern Moab, and extravagant black-mail was
levied by all the petty sheikhs. Now that the Pasha of
Damascus has placed a garrison there, the ﬁllaheen are better
off, trade has quadrupled, and the country is as safe for
Europeans as Western Palestine. With a garrison at Kerak“
and the Beni Sukk’r conciliated, as at present, the Imperial
Government could hold the coast of the Dead Sea as easily
as it holds the Lebanon.”

From Es-Salt to Jericho is a nine hours’ journey. The

chief interest centres in Nimrim, the ancient Beth '

Nimrah, an Amorite city, which was rebuilt by the tribe
of Gad (Numb. xxii. 36; Joshua xiii. 27). There are now
only heaps of ruins to be seen.‘ In Isa. xv. 6, the pr0phet
drclares “The waters of N imrim shall be desolate; for the
hay is withered away; the grass .faileth; there is no green
thing.” From N imrim a ford is reached across the Jordan,
and then the Western plain is traversed through Khirbet-es-
' Sumrah and Khirbet Nuwaimeh to Jericho.

"‘ Dr. Tristram adds in a footnote, “ While these sheets are in the
press (March, 1873) we learn that the Turks have thrown a garrison
into Kerak.”
