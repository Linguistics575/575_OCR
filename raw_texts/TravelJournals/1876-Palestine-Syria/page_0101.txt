LATRﬁN. , 33

Gezer.’f We have thus new data for many important points
of dispute. There are, for instance, the boundaries of a
Levitical city (Num. xxxv. ‘4, 5) 5 the direction ‘of the
square, which is now seen to have lain with its four . angles
at the four cardinal points; the exact length of “ two
