MAR SABA. 215

holes in the walls—with ledges in front—where are the cells
and dwelling-places of monks. The place is full of mystery.
You see men walking upon these ledges of rock, and turning
into these holes in the walls; and you look upon a little
garden hanging in the air, as it seems, with a solitary palm-
tree looking wonderingly down into the chasm, in which are

The founder of this remarkable Convent—which can

St. Nicholas, is a grotto or cave, where, behind a screen,

contains a few pictures worthy of examination. The
