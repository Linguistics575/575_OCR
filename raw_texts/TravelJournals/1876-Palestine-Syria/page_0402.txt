382 JAFFA TO ASCALON AND GAZA.

on the plain, may probably be found the refuge of Samson
in the ‘ cliff ’ Etam before his victory with the jawbone,
as, perhaps, afterwards, of David in the Cave of Adullam.
It is not often that on the same scene events so romantic
have been enacted at such an interval of time, as the deeds
of strength which were wrought in this plain by him ‘ before
whose lion ramp the bold Askalonite fell,’ and those of our
own Cmur de Lion.”

Yebna is a modern town, with some ruins of the ancient
Jabneb, or Jamnia, and also of a church of the Crusaders.
It is well situated on an eminence declining towards the sea.
The population is about 3000, subsisting chieﬂy by agri-
culture, and gathering abundant harvests with very rude
appliances from the fertile lands of the vicinity. The
threshing-ﬂoors round the village, and the oxen treading
out the corn, are exceedingly illustrative of Scripture usages.

Jabneh was a town on the boundary of Judah, as seen in
*Joshua xv. II. It came into the power of the Philistines,
from whom Uzziah took it, and “ broke down the wall”
(2 Chron. xxvi. 6). In the timeof the Maccabees the place
was called Jamnia(1 Macc. iv. 15). See also 2 Macc. xi. 40,
where it is recorded that after the overthrow of Georgias by
Judas Maccabeus at this place, the latter “found under the
coats of every one that was slain things consecrated to the idols
of the Jamnites. Then every man saw that this was the cause
for which they were slain.” There must then have been
idols and temples here at that time. Strabo says this district
was densely populated, and that 40,000 armed men came
forth from Jamnia and its vicinity. Of the harbour of
Jamnia, at the mouth of the Wady Surz’ir, no trace remains.
This was the place where Judas Maccabeus “ set ﬁre to the
haven and the navy, so that the light was seen at Jerusalem ”
(2 Macc. xii. 9).
