green foliage, and hard beautifully-veined wood, are alike
singular and easy of recognition.

The Vine is much less cultivated than in past times.
There are a few vineyards in the neighbourhood of Jeru-
salem, and more near Bethlehem, and on the slopes of
Hermon and Lebanon 5 but in the Valley of Eshcol the vine
still attains its greatest size and productiveness; the grapes
here being the property of Muslims, who drink no wine,
are used only for raisins and syrups. Wine and brandy are
frequently made from raisins in Syria, but fresh grapes are
also now used for the purpose.

The cultivation of the Fig-tree is generally combined
with that of the vine. Its large leaves and thick foliage
give a deep and welcome shade 3 it thrives even on stony
ground and in waste places. The fruit is produced at three
or four periods of the year. First there is the Moor, or
early-ripe ﬁg, which precedes the leaves, and ripens generally
towards the end of June ; then the lam-mouse, or summer ﬁg,
seldom ripe before August; and the winter ﬁg, which hangs
and ripens on the tree even after the leaves have fallen.
The wild ﬁg (Ficus sycamoms) is a sort of banyan, and its
leaves slightly resemble those of the mulberry. It propa-
gates itself by seed or spores. .

The Almond-tree is the earliest in blossoming, and is
covered with its white ﬂowers in January or February ; the
green leaves appear later; the fruit, in the meantime, is
formed while the ﬂowers are yet on the tree, so that buds,
blossoms, and almonds may be seen on the same branch.
Its very name in the Hebrew signiﬁes haste.

The stately and symbolical Palm—tree is becoming very
scarce in Central Palestine, and there are but few even
around Jericho, to which city they formerly gave their
name. They are still planted in the courts of convents and '
