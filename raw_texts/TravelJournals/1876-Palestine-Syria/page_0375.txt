CHALCIS. 35 5

The diligence road, constructed by a French Company in
1860, is an excellent one, and is, in fact, the only road in
‘ Syria.

Soon after leaving Damascus the Jebel Késiﬁn (p. 3 53) is
seen on the right. The last views of the beautiful city will
be gazed upon reluctantly; the villa of Abd-el-Kader (p. 347)
will be seen on the right. Dummar is a little village, to
the villas of which some of the Damascenes resort.

At Hemeh a halt is generally made, and horses

vegetation rich, and trees abound on every hand. It is the

soldiers from Damascus are reviewed.

On the right is the village of Dimes, with the Khan of

scenes lately passed than those upon which the traveller now ‘
enters. A rocky ravine leads to Khan Meiselﬁn, and

which was once celebrated for its banditti. It is a wild glen
or ravine, and is nearly three miles in length. The next
halting-place is El—Judeideh, at the end of the Wady-el-
Karn. A long, and somewhat uninteresting, valley is now
entered. On the right is the village of Mejdel, above
which are some beautiful ruins of a temple of very ancient
date. They are well Worth seeing; and the view over the
plain of Buka'a is remarkable, bounded as it is by the whole
mountain-chains of Hermon and Lebanon. Chalcis is
the remnant of a once-ﬂourishing city. It was given by the
Emperor Claudius to Herod, grandson of Herod the Great.
Little, however, is known of the place, and nothing of its
