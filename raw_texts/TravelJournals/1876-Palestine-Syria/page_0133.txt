SITUATION OF JERUSALEM. 1 I 3

of another; and the present city is standing upon the accumu-
lated ruins of several preceding ones (p. I 14.).

All this throws great doubt on many of the sacred places
of Jerusalem; the real localities lie buried far beneath the
surface of the present city. But the natural features of the
country remain substantially unchanged. “ The mountains
round about Jerusalem,” which were of old her bulwarks,
are still there. Here are Olivet and the brook Kidron;
and the city still crowns Zion and Moriah. Kings and
prOphets and holy men looked on these scenes, and the feet
of the Son of God trod the very ground on which we here
walk. Somewhere in the buried city under our feet He did ‘
hear his cross; and these hills we tread trembled by the
earthquake’s power when He expired.

Jerusalem stands on four hills, once separated by deep
valleys, which are now partially ﬁlled by the de’lm's of suc-
cessive destructions of the city. Zion, the most celebrated
of these, is on the south-west, rising on its southern decli-
vity 300 feet above the valley of Hinnom, and on the south-
east 500 feet above the Kidron. The Tyropaeon sweeps
around its northern and eastern bases, separating it from
Akra and Moriah. Zion was the old citadel of the Jebusites,
and “the city of David.” Mount Moriah is on the south-
east, separated from Zion by the Tyr0paeon, and from Olivet
by the deep gorge of the Kidron. This is much lower than
Zion. It was the site of the ancient Temple, and is now
crowned by the Mosque of Omar. On the north-east is
Mount Bezetha, a hill higher than Moriah, which was en-
closed within the walls, after the time of Christ, by Herod
Agrippa. Mount Akra. the highest point of the city, is on the
north-west. It is separated from Zion by the Tyropaeon, and
from Bezetha by a broad valley running northward into the

Tyr0paeon, as it sweeps around the foot of Zion south ward. It
