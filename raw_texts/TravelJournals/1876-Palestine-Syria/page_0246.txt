the mountains of Galilee, and terminating in the beautiful
plateau of Basqan. Here it forms the -Waters of Merom
(Lake Hﬁleh), from whence, increased in volume and force,
owing to the depression of the valley, it ﬂows into the Lake
of Galilee. Emerging from this lake, it plunges in twenty-
seven rapids down a fall of 1000 ft. through what is the
lowest and ﬁnal stage of its course.

“The only known instance of a greater fall is the
Sacramento River in California ” (Stanley). Finally, after
being enriched by the waters of Jabbok, made illustrious by
Jacob’s mysterious conﬂict, it falls into the Dead Sea, from
whence it does not emerge again.

The length of the river, in a straight line from its source
to the Dead Sea, is not more than 120 miles; its course,
however, is so remarkable that between the Lake of Galilee
and the Dead Sea, 60 miles of actual length is increased to
200 by its corkscrew windings. The river varies in width
from 80 to 160 ft., and in depth from ﬁve to twelve feet.

For the sources of the Jordan (see pp. 319— 32 3).

For the best account of the river the traveller should

Every stage of the river is sacred with Historical
Associations. “Lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all
the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere,"
and was “ even as the garden of the Lord ” (Gen. xiii. 10).
After the forty years’ wandering, the Israelites “ crossed
over it on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean
over." The passage occurredjn the time of harvest, i.e., the
beginning of April, when the waters were at their highest,
from the early rains, and the melting snows, “ for Jordan
overﬂoweth all his banks all the time of harvest.” “And the
waters which came down from above stood and rose up
upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside
