evening, to do according to all that is written in the law of
the Lord, which He commanded Israel ” (1 Chron. xvi.
39—40. See also xxi. 29 ; 2 Chron. i. 2).

It was here that one of the most interesting religious
ceremonies was ever seen in Judaea. “ The king (Solomon)
went to Gibeon to sacriﬁce there; for that was the great high
place; a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon
