come and worship, when old Mattathias and his ﬁve sons
burst upon the scene, scattered the idolaters, and ﬂed to the
hills. Then commenced the long and glorious struggle of
the Maccabean _War, resulting in new national life, new
modes of thought, and an entirely new phase of Judaism.
On this mound were buried Mattathias and his son, the re-
nowned Judas Maccabeus, Lion of Judah, and others of the
Asmonaean family.

Very near Latrﬁn is the village of AmW§s, or Em-
maus (not the Emmaus of St. Luke's Gospel), with the
ruins of a church and a fountain, which is said to have had
almost miraculous properties for healing all manner of
diseases. This small village was an important town in an-
cient times, although it does not receive any mention in the
Scriptures. Here Judas Maccabeus gained a victory over
Georgias(1 Mac. iii. 40—57, iv. 3, ix. 50). The Roman
General Varus burned the city in 4 A.D. It was rebuilt in
no A.D., by Julius Africanus, and by him named Nicopolisr
It is utterly impossible to reconcile this Amwas, or Emmaus,
with the town of that name in the Gospel, although curi-
ously enough it was regarded as that site for nearly ten
centuries (third to thirteenth).

This town and Beit Nuba (a little to the north) are pro-
mine'nt in the story of Richard Cmur de Lion’s last weeks in
Palestine, before concluding a peace with Saladin.

One hour from Latrﬁn, passing Bir Eyydb (Job’s Well)
and Deir Eyydb (Job’s Convent), the traveller arrives, at the
foot of the mountains, at a place called Bib-el-Wady (the
door or entrance to the valley).

[Travellers under the arrangements of Messrs. Coon and
SON generally make the ﬁrst day’s journey an easy one, and
camp for the night in this neighbourhood. They Will be
surprised to see the tents all pitched, and a “ canvas town "
