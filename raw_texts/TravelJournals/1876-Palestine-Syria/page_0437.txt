TYRE. 41 7

ruins only date from early Christian and mediaeval times.
These are the remains of the cathedral where William of
Tyre, who wrote a history of the crusade, was for ten years
archbishop, and where Frederick Barbarossa and Origen
. were buried.

There seems reason to believe that a colony from Sidon
settled on the island, which is now a peninsula, less than two
hundred years after the Flood, and erected a Temple of Her-
cules, and a few dwellings. Soon after a city on the main-
land was added. In Joshua xix. 29, this place is called “ a
strong city.” About four centuries after, David and Hiram,
King of Tyre, are found in friendly alliance (2. Sam. v. 11),
the latter monarch sending David materials for the erection
of the temple. This alliance continued during the reign of
Solomon. Under Hiram, Tyre probably attained to its
highest prosperity. Ezekiel (chapter xxvii.) gives a full
description of Tyrian commerce, and luxury, and power.
About a century after Solomon’s time, Ahab, King of Israel
married Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, (or Ithobal) who was
King of Tyre, and priest of Astarte (1 Kings xvi. 3 I).
Through the idolatrous inﬂuence of Jezebel’s early education
by the shrines of Baal and Ashtoreth, much trouble came
upon Israel. It is probable that at this time a bridge and
aqueduct connected the mainland city (which had come to
be called Old Tyre) with the island city.

In 720 13.0., Psalmanezer took Old Tyre on the mainland,
and for ﬁve years ineffectually tried to get possession of the
island. When the Assyrians withdrew, the mainland city
was again rebuilt. The next siege of Tyre was led by Nebu-
chadnezzar in 584 3.0. The thnicians had seen Judaea over-
run and Jerusalem captured with feelings of delight. Not long
before (2 Kings xxiii. 20), Josiah had endeavoured to uproot
Sidonian idolatry in his kingdom, insulted the gods, and
