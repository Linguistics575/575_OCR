4.26 TYRE T0 SIDON.

Sidon: “ Both were illustrious and splendid formerly and.
now ; but which should be called the capital of thnicia', is
a matter of dispute amongst the inhabitants.” He states
also that the town of Sidon is situated on a ﬁne, naturally-
formed harbour, and that its inhabitants cultivated the
sciences of arithmetic and astronomy, and gave great facili-
ties for their study. Such would be the state of things at
Sidon at the time of our Saviour’s visit. The town was
about ﬁfty miles from Nazareth, and is the most northern
‘ place mentioned in the accounts of his journeyings.

In 325 A.D. the ﬁrst bishop of Sidon,Theodorus, attended
the Council of Nice. The town scarcely appears again in
history till Baldwin and his Crusaders conquered it in I I I I A.D.‘
Troublous times now set in. Seventy-six years the
Christians held it, and then in 1187 Saladin seized, dis-
mantled and partially destroyed the city. Ten years after it
was again taken by the Christians, temporarily occupied and
despoiled, and again left to the Muslims, who rushed in
under Melek Adel, the brother of Saladin, and ﬁnished the
work of destruction. It was again rebuilt and again
destroyed; and in 12 5 3 St. Louis renewed the fortiﬁcations,
and for about thirty years it was held by the Knights Temp-
lars. The Muslims again dismantled the town in 12.91, and
so by degrees, the alternate prey of conﬂicting armies, Sidon
sank towards decay.

At the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Emir
Fakhr ed-Din, built a palace here,of which some remains are
still seen. He also erected the castle-like khan, and encou-
raged French traders to settle here. Till the time of the
Revolution, the place became almost a French colony.
Since the expulsion of the foreign merchants by Djezzar
Pasha, Sidon has gradually declined to its present miserable
state and proportions. '
