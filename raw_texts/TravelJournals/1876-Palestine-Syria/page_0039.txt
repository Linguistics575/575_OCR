river Kishon, and passing near to the place of sacriﬁce. Haifa,
at foot of Mount Carmel, is being rapidly brought under culti-
vation by a colony of Germans who have built a hotel and a
number of cottages. Here a day or two may be pleasantly
spent if the travelling and steamer arrangements are carefully
calculated. The Austrian Lloyds steamers call at Haifa on
their passage both ways between Alexandria and Constanti-
n0ple. The tour should be arranged to harmonize with the
steamboat service, which is fortnightly both ways.

SIXTH ITINERARY.

EMBRACING ALL or THE FIFTH AS FAR AS HAITA, AND IN-
CLUDING THE COAST ROUTE BY TYRE AND SIDON
T0 BEYROUT.

After the ten days of travel described in the Fifth Itinerary,
the Sixth may be accomplished by four additional days as shown
below:

11TH DMZ—Travel from Haifa to Acre and encamp there
near the ancient fortress—not a heavy day if the weather is
favourable. Five or six hours in the saddle.

12TH DAY.—Ascend the Ladder of Tyre—a rough and
difficult way, greatly improved—to the city of Tyre. Ancient
fountains, the reputed tomb of Hiram, King of Tyre, and sub-
merged ruins engage the attention of travellers here, where the
camp will be stationed for a night, after a ride of perhaps six to
seven hours.

13TH DAY.—Travel by Sarepta to Sidon, another moderate
riding day of six or seven hours, to the camping ground at
Sidon, the city so frequently associated in sacred history with
Tyre.

14TH DAY.-Fr0m Sidon to Beyrout is a coast journey of
seven to eight hours, and this daycompletes our Sixth Itinerary.
Beyrout is a delightful place to rest after a journey through
Palestine, and there is more certainty of embarking than at
Jaffa.
