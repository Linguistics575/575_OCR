ASHDOD. 333

It is said that after the fall of Jerusalem Jamnia became
noted as a seat of learning, and that Gamaliel was buried
here.

Leaving the island- like hill on which Yebna stands, the
traveller crosses the plain towards Esdﬁd.

Esdu‘d (anciently Ashdod) is a magniﬁcent village,
beautifully situated on the eastern SIOpe of a hill, in the
