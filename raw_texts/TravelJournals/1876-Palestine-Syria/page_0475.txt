perous city and a bishop’s see in the early Christian era, but
speedily came to ruin after the Saracen invasion.

The visitor will see that the prophecies of Jeremiah and
Ezekiel are here completely fulﬁlled.“ I will cause an alarm
of war to be heard 1n Rabbah of the Ammonites, and it shall
be a desolate heap ” (Jer. xliv. 2). “I will make Rabbah
a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couching-place for
ﬂocks” (Ezek. xxv. 5).

From Rabbath Ammon to Jerash, by the course of the
river Jabbok, 1s a two days' journey, the camp having to be
ﬁxed according to circumstances.

The Jabbok, now called the Wady Z’urka, is a stream
by which the mountain range of Gilead is intersected from
west to east. It ﬂows along a deep ravine, receiving nume-
rous tributaries, and reaches the Jordan about half-way
between the Dead Sea and the Lake of Gennesaret. Anciently
it was the boundary of the territory of the children of Ammon
(Numb. xxi. 2.4; Deut. ii. 37, iii. 16). When Sihon, king of
the Amorites, drove the Moabites to the south, and the
Ammonites further to the north and east, the latter settled on
the eastern plain, and amongst the deﬁles of Gilead round
the sources and upper branches of the Jabbok. On the
southern bank of the Jabbok occurred the meeting between
Jacob and Esau recorded in Gen. xxxii. 22. Beside this
stream also Jacob wrestled with the Angel, and received his
name of Israel. The western portion of this river was at
one period the boundary between the kingdoms of 0g and
Sihon.

Jerash (anciently Gerasa) shows the ﬁnest and most
exteusive ruins in the district “ beyond Jordan.” They are
in the form of an irregular square, each side being a mile in
length, and are situated on both sides of a valley running
from north to south across a high undulating plain.
