THE HAUR’AN. 43 r

- the Muslim rule, Christianity has again become almost
extinct. ‘

The tourist in the Haurﬁn will ﬁnd Oriental life and
manners existing in primitive vigour to a far greater extent
than in other portions of Palestine, which have come so
largely under European inﬂuences, and where European
customs, and even European fashions, are often ludicrously
copied.

Commencing the Hauran journey from Damascus, the
plain is crossed to KaIJr-es-Sit, “ Tomb of the Lady," where
Zeinab, grand-daughter of Mahomed, was buried. The
Hajys of Persia are especially noticeable amongst the
dovotee's who come on pilgrimages to the mosque above the
grave. Continuing the course, the majestic Hermon is con-
spicuous on the west. The bare black hills to the south are
the Jebel-el-Aswad, “ Black Mountains,” the eastern ex-
tremity of which is reached after a seven miles’ ride. A
fertile valley is soon entered, through which ﬂows the ’Awaj
or Pharpar, with- the village of Nejha near its bank.

The ’Awaj rises on the slopes of Hermon, and ﬂows
about forty miles to the most southerly of the three lakes of
Damascus. Under its name of Pharpar it will be remem-
bered as one of the “rivers of Damascus which Naaman
thought so much better than all the waters of Israel ”
(2 Kings v. 12). From Nejha there ,is a good view up the
verdant valley of the ’Awaj, between the enclosing ranges of
the Jebel-el-Aswad and Jebel-Mani’a. On an eminence to
'the left, is the Muslim wely of Abu Zid.

Leaving the valley, a bleak and dreary wilderness has to
be crossed, much infested by the Bedaw‘in. Stones and
fragments of rocks are scattered in thick profusion. Then
comes a broad plain, where grass and weeds ﬂourish luxu-
riantly in the rich black earth, once so carefully cultivated,
