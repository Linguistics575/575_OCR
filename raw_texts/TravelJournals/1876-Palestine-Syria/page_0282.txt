262 JERUSALEM TO SAMARIA.

Ebal; below, to the east, is the fertile plain of Makhna, and
beyond, the mountains of Gilead.

Mount Ebal, on the north 'side of the valley of
N abulus, is celebrated for its view, which is ﬁner than that
from Gerizim. The ascent is by no means difﬁcult ; and the
view of the mountains of Galilee, from Carmel on the left to
Gilboa on the right, with Tabor and Safed, and a host of
memorable places, is well worth the fatigue, if time permits.

From either mountain, the 'scene' recorded in Joshua
viii. 33, 34, will be recalled with interest, for in the valley of
NAbulus and on the hill-sides, the tribes of Israel were
assembled, while the Levites lifted up their voices, and pro-
nounced from Gerizim blessings upon the obedient, and from
Ebal cursings upon the rebellious. “ And all Israel, and
their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side
the ark and on that side, before the priests and the Levites,
which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, as well the
stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them -
over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against
mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the Lord had com-
manded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.
And afterwards Joshua read all the words of the law, the
blessings and the cursings, according to all that is written in
the book of the law.” It is a curious fact that, owing to
the formation of the hills, they form, as it were, a natural
sounding-board ; and many travellers have afﬁrmed that,
standing in the plain, they have been able to hear distinctly
the utterances of friends stationed on either mountains, who
have gone there to test the accuracy of the statements of
Moses and Joshua (Dent. xxvii. 11—13).

The‘ journey from Nabulus to Samaria is through
the beautiful valley, where every variety of vegetation will
be seen. There are many brooks and streams of water
