268 SAMARIA T0 NAZARETH.

plundering Arabs make the‘ place so insecure, that gigantic,
thistles and wildernesses of weeds take the place of pro-
ﬁtable cultivation; and nowhere, except in some of the
eastern branches of the plain, is there a single dwelling.

Looking across the plain, as we leave Jenin, we have on
the north Tabor and Little Hermon (the former not visible
until some distance has been traversed); on the east, the
mountains of Gilboa, terminating in the ridge, where the
story of the death of Saul and Jonathan is localized 5 on. the
south the mountains of Samaria. This plain has been a
battle-ﬁeld from the days of Barak to Napoleon. Warriors
out of every nation which is under heaven have pitched
their tents in the Plain of Esdraelon, and have beheld the
various banners of their nations wet with the dews of Tabor
and of Hermon—(Dr. Clarke.)

Esdraelon was the frontier of Zebulun (Deut. xxxiii. 18),
and the special portion of Issachar. Here Barak, descend-
ing from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him,
discomﬁted Sisera, whose defeat was owing, in great measure,
to his having been drawn to the river Kishon—a river which
drains the plain into the Mediterranean. “The river of
. Kishon swept them away ; that ancient river, the river
Kishon ” (Judges v. 21). Here Josiah the king came to
ﬁght with Necho, the King of Egypt, and received his
death-wound (2 Chron. xxxv. 20—25). From generation to
generation Esdraelon was the scene of plunder and of war;
the Canaanites who, under Jabin, King of Canaan, had nine
hundred chariots of iron, which could work fearful mischief
on the level plain, mightily oppressed the children of Israel
for twenty years (Judges iv. 3). Then the Midianites pre-
vailed against Israel; “ and so it was when Israel had sown,
that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites and the
children of the East, even they came up against them, . . .
