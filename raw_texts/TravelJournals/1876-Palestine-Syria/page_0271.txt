JACOB’S WELL. 25 r

perhaps, have been some of the thoughts of the Saviour
as He sat thus on 'the well, being wearied with his jour-
ney. Perhaps He was thinking of Abraham, who built
his ﬁrst altar in the land in this opening of the plain (Gen.
xii. 6), or of Jacob, whose only possession in the Land of
Promise was. here (xxxiii. 19), and even then, bought and
paid for as it had been, it was taken from him by the
Amorites; but he reconquered it from them. ‘I took it
out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and my
bow,’ said the dying old man (Gen. xlviii. 22), and left it
to Jowph, who, long years afterwards, gave commandment
concerning his bones, which were brought from Egypt and
buried here (Joshua xxiv. 32). Perhaps Christ thought of
Joseph, wandering in that very ﬁeld in search of his brethren
(Gen. xxxvii. 15), and saw, in the persecution of the brethren,
and the ﬁnal victory of the beloved son, one of the divine
pictures of the past, testifying of Himself; or, perhaps, his
thoughts were dwelling upon that ﬁrst gathering of all
Israel, when ﬁrst they came into the land, and there
was set before them a blessing and a curse. Perhaps
he heard again the ‘ Amen ’ of the people, as the
curses were uttered from Ebal ; or saw the smile of joy
as the blessings on hearth and home, and land and business,
were pronounced from Gerizim, and ‘ sighed deeply ’ as He
grieved for the hardness of the hearts of that favoured
people, who had gone in the way of evil, and brought upon
them all the full letter of awful doom pronounced upon the
disobedient (see Deut. xi. 29, 30, xxviii. 5 Joshua viii. 30, 3 5).
No wonder that, in the midst of associations such as these,
He should say, ‘ I have meat to eat that you know not of.’
Before Him was unrolled, throughout that land, the volume
of the ages, and in every page He read the ‘ things concern-
ing Himself.’ ”—(Hodder.)
