a light from heaven: and he fell to the earth, and heard a
voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou
Me? . . . . And he trembling and astonished said, Lord,
what wilt Thou have me to do P And the Lord said unto
him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee
what thou must do. . . . . And Saul arose from the earth ;-
and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they
led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus”
(Acts ix.)

Before us is the great plain of Damascus, a sea of ver-
dure; in the distance, to the right, will be seen the white
minarets of the city, on the left the magniﬁcent slopes of
Lebanon; around, streams of water. everal towns and
villages, without anything remarkable about them to call for
special notice, are passed, and then the groves and gardens
_ for which Damascus 18 so famous are entered, and the waters
of Abana and Pharpar, which seem “to be better than all
the waters of Israel,” are beside us, and we enter the gate of
the oldest city in the world.
