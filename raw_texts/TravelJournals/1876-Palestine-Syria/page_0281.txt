MOUNT GERIZIM. 261

than ten minutes the whole, with the exception of a few
fragments, had disappeared. These were gathered and
placed on the hurdle, and the area carefully examined, every
crumb picked up, together with the bones, and all burnt
over a ﬁre kindled for the purpose in a trough, where the
water had been boiled. ‘And ye shall let nothing of it
