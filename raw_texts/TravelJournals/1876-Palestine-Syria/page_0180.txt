1 6o JERUSALEM

the remainder of the Stations are within the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre.

There are two stations omitted in the foregoing list,—the
spot where Jesus is said to have met His mother, and the spot
where He leaned a second time and left the impression of His
hand. Also in the Via Dolorosa may be seen the House of
Lazarus, the poor man of the parable, and the House of
Dives, the rich man.

A short distance to the south-east of the Church of the

St. John of Alexandria; the former for females, the latter

of Hospitallers or Knights of St. John; St. John the Baptist
being then the patron saint. The traveller may here refresh

2. The Knights Templars, who had their quarters in the
Temple Haram, where now stands the Mosque El Aksa
(p. 137); 3. The Teutonic Knights of St. Mary of Jeru-

representations of the months. The Church is in ruin.
An old refectory has been repaired, and is turned into a
