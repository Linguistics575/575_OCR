will be seen,therefore,that¢he city slopes down from the north-
west to the south-east; and standing‘on the north-west angle
of the wall, you are at the highest 'ph‘int, ‘and see Moriah far
below on the south-east, with the. Tyropaeon on the west of
it, running down between it and Zion to‘the junction of the
Kidron with Hinnom. The wall of the city is irregular,
conformed to the hills over which it passes, but substantially
“ the city lieth foursquare.” * A walk around the. outside of
the wall commands a view of all the exterior objects of
interest (p. 163).

EXOAVATIONS lN JERUSALEM.

The difficulties connected with exploration in Jerusa-
lem are enormous, and it is impossible to sufﬁciently praise
the unparalleled labours of Captains Wilson and Warren,
Lieutenant Condor, and others, through whose undaunted
courage and untiring effort so many important discoveries
have been brought to light. See “ Palestine Exploration
Fund” (p. 56). l

The accumulation of the rubbish of ages has had to be
dug through, so that in one part—the north-east wall of the
Temple—the débris was 12.5 feet in depth. It must be
remembered that the Jerusalem of to-day is built upon a
heap of buried cities. “ One city literally lies heaped upon
another. For Jerusalem stood no fewer than twenty-seven
sieges from Jebusites ‘ and Israelites, Egyptians and Assy—
rians, Greeks and Romans, Mahomedans and Christians.
The last, and twenty-seventh, 'siege took place in 1244 at the
hands of the wild Karezmian hordes, who plundered the
city and slaughtered the priests and monks. The ex-
plorers have thus to do not with one city, but with many.
The Jerusalem of our day may be considered the eighth,
for even before the time of David there was a city there.
