31 o TELL-HEM TO SAFED.

shall be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which
have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would
have remained until this day. But I say unto you, That it
shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of
judgment, than for thee.”—(Matt. xi. 20—24.)

EXCURSION TO SAFED, MEIRON, AND
- KEFR BIRIM. - '

From Tell-Hum to Safed is _a journey of about three
hours. It can be made either by following the watercourse
from Tell-Hum to Kerﬁzeh (Chorazin, p 308), .or by going
a short distance south, and then ascending a hill to the right.
Either way leads to Khan Yubb Yusef (p 317), from whence
there is a rather steep road leading in a north-westerly
direction. In about an hour and a quarter from Khan Yubb
Yﬁsef a beautiful spring is reached, called ’Ain-eI-Hamra,
and in a few minutes Safed is in sight.

Safed is one of the four holy cities in Palestine of which
the Jews say that if prayer should cease to be offered in
them, the world would instantly come to an end. The
other three are Jerusalem, Hebron, and Tiberias. Many
Jews hold that the Messiah will make His first appearance
. here, and after reigning forty years, go forth to receive uni-
versal homage. It is one of the chief seats of modern
Judaism, and has a Jewish population—Ashkerazim and
Sephardimu—of about 4000, the remainder of the inhabitants
being Christians. It is one of the shrines which every
Hebrew pilgrim to the Holy Land regards it as a matter of
religion to visit. The city is modern, and there is no trace
whatever of its mention in the Old Testament, nor has it
played any important part in Jewish history. It is famous.
for its Rabbinical schools, which sprang up in the sixteenth
century, and, like Tiberias, for its famous teachers.
