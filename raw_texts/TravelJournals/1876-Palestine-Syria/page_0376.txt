356 DAMASCUS T0 BEYROUT.

origin; it is referred to by Josephus. Crossing the river
’Anj ar, and further on a tributary of the Litﬁny, with the
village of Kub Elias on the left, the broad valley of the
Buka’a is crossed.

At Shtéra, where a halt is again made, there is a road
to Ba’albek, which may be reached in about seven hours.
From here the ascent is made up the mountain of Lebanon
by a series of wonderful zigzags. When the summit is
reached, the view is magniﬁcent beyond description.

The route from Shtéra to Beyrout is identical with that
elsewhere described.

FROM DAMASOUS TO BEYROUT. VIA
BA’ALBEK-

This journey may be done comfortably as follows: Camp
the ﬁrst night at Surghéiya, and reach Ba’albek about the
middle of the following day. Stay there the night, and for
a few hours of the next morning, then on to Shtora, and‘
.camp either there or on the slope of Lebanon, and the next
.day to Beyrout; or, if time permits, the journey may be
made by Salébiyeh and Kasiﬁn (p. 353), then stay the night
.at ’Ain Fijeh, a short day’s work, then to Surghﬁya, and
then as above.

Leaving Damascus, we travel by the French diligence
road to Dummar (p. 355), then, turning to the right, enter
a barren gorge, a marvellous contrast to the view of Damascus
just left behind (p. 336). Then a portion of the plain of
Sabra is crossed, and the scene altogether alters. High cliffs
are on our right hand, in which are any‘ number of tombs,
some with Greek inscriptions; while on the left are naked
limestone rocks, which will remind the traveller of the
Dolomites, or if he has not visited that wonderful region,
will suggest to him mammoth architectural ruins. Bessima
