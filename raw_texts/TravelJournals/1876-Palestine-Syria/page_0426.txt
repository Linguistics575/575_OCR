406 JAFFA TO HAIFA.

Tacitus, Caesarea had become the chief town in the Roman
province of Judaea. It was the royal dwelling-place of the
Herodian family, and the oﬂicial residence of Festus, Felix,
and other Roman Procurators, and the head-quarters of the
Roman troops charged with the security and tranquillity of
this part of the Empire. In the time of the Crusades the.
town was still of importance. Baldwin I. took the city from
the Saracens in 1102, but it was recaptured in 1187 by
Saladin. In 1190 it was again won by the Crusaders, but
only to belost a second time in 12.19. St. Louis took the
city in 1251, and partially rebuilt its walls. Caesarea has
since sunk into utter decay.

There are many allusions to Caesarea in the New Testa-
ment, all tending to show its importance at that epoch-
When Paul had been let down in a basket from the wall of
Damascus to save him from the Jews, it was to Caesarea the
disciples hurried him, and shipped him for his own city of
Tarsus (Acts ix. 30). At Caesarea dwelt Cornelius, the
devout centurion who with his family were the ﬁrst Gentile
converts after Peter’s vision at Joppa (Acts 32., xi.) To
Caesarea came Peter when his prison doors at Jerusalem
had miraculously Opened to him (Acts xii. 19). Here Paul
landed on his way to Jerusalem, after his ﬁrst missionary
journey in Greece (Acts xviii. 22). In this city dwelt
“ Philip the Evangelist,” with his “ four daughters, virgins,
which did prophesy,” in whose house “ Paul’s company,"
who had come by ship from Ptolemais, “ tarried many days.”
On this occasion Paul was visited by Agabus the prophet,
with a sign of Paul's approaching capture at Jerusalem.
But in vain his friends counselled ﬂight, Paul was ready
“ not to be bound only, but also to die,” and with “ certain
of the disciples of Caesarea ” he went up to Jerusalem (Acts
xi. 8, 16).
