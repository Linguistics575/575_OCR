282 NAZARETH.

There are many traditional places to which the traveller
will wend his way—some of them valueless so far as histo—
rical evidence is concerned, but all interesting, from the fact
that somewhere in the immediate neighbourhood the actual
sites must have been.

The Latin Convent is one of the most interesting places
in Nazareth; it is enclosed within high walls, and contains
the Church of the Annunciation. The high altar is
dedicated to the angel Gabriel, and is approached by marble
steps on either side. Several fairly good pictures. adorn the
church, which has also a good organ. Below the altar is
the crypt, which we descend by a broad ﬂight of ﬁfteen
marble steps, leading into the Chapel of the Angels, and
this again leads by two steps into the Chapel of the
Annunciation. Here a marble altar stands, with an in-
scription, “ Here the Word was made ﬂesh " (“ Hic verbum
caro factum est”). On the right and left are columns,
marking the places where the angel and Mary stood; the
latter is only a broken column, and tradition says it was
thus destroyed by enemies who sought to destroy the
church, and was miraculously suSpended.

A doorway leads from this chapel into the Chapel of
Joseph, and from this a stairway leads into the Kitchen of
vothe Virgin—a mere cave, the mouth of which is pointed
out as being the chimney.

It will be remembered that the Holy House of Nazareth
is not really- here, but at Loreto, in Italy. It is stated that
when the basilica erected by the pious care of the Empress
Helena over the Virgin’s house at Nazareth fell into decay,
the Casa Santa, or Holy House, was brought by angels to a
spot between Fiume and Tersato, on the coast of Dalmatia,
where it rested three years. Thence it was again carried-off
by angels in the night to the ground of a certain widow
