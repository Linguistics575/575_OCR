44 HISTORY.

“ The course of pilgrimages now continued unbroken.
The object was not merely to visit consecrated spots, but to .
ﬁnd relics. If a pretended fragment of the holy cross was
not to be met with, the pilgrim could at least bring away an
olive branch, a phial of Jordan water, a garment dipped in
the holy stream, and thereby rendered an invulnerable
pan0ply against demons; or sometimes he would content
himself with a handful of earth picked up at Jerusalem, a
rose or a palm branch -cut in the oasis of Jericho. The
pilgrim’s staff was hung up over the hearth on his return, as
a family relic. . . Pilgrimages did not cease with the
invasion of Islam, they did but become more meritorious as
the danger increased.

“Then came a time when the whole of Christian
Europe went on pilgrimage; but this pilgrimage was made
under arms, and with the ﬁrm resolve of conquering from
the Inﬁdels, the tomb of Christ, and the country which had
been consecrated by his presence.” ,

Jerusalem. The clergy, monks, consecrated virgins, and
other inhabitants, to the number, it is said, of 90,000, were
massacred by the Jews, and every church demolished. The
city was regained by the Roman Emperor Heraclius, who
carried back into Jerusalem the “ true cross,” which the
invaders had stolen.

Abbut a quarter of a century passed, and then the Maho—
medan Arabs, under Caliph Omar, came upon the scene.
Jerusalem was taken, and the Mosque erected which still
crowns the hill of Moriah. For the next two centuries, Pales-
tine was the scene of civil war between the Ommiyade, the
Abbasside, and the Fatimite-Caliphs. From the middle of
the eighth century, it was a province of the Abbasside Caliphs
