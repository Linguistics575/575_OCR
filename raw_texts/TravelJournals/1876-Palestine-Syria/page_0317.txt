water is bright, and except in the neighbourhood of Tiberias,
where it is polluted with the sewage of the town, is good for
drinking purposes. It is still subject to violent storms, as in
the days of the Gospels, and Captain Wilson has well
described a storm he witnessed, which singularly well illus-
trates the Gospel narrative. (Recovery, p. 340.)

In the lake there are a number of warm Springs. Earth-
quakes are not infrequent, and sometimes extremely violent,
as in 18 3 7, when so much damage was done to Tiberias
(p- 2'93)-

Boats on the Lake.—Many travellers will like to row
upon the lake, and, apart from the intense interest of the
associations of this sacred sea,1 it is an enjoyable way of
travelling from Tiberias to Capernaum.

There are only two boats, but these are capable of holding
ten or a dozen passengers each, in addition to the rowers.
They are rough in construction and awkward to row, but the
best view of both sides of the lake are thus obtained, and the
traveller is perhaps able to realize some of the scenes in the
Gospel history better in this way than in walking or riding
on the shore.

Enquiry should be made at Tiberias for the boats, and if
there be a party, it would be well to send one of the muleteers
ahead in order to secure them.

F iShing.—There are a great number of ﬁsh in the lake,
small and large, and of various kinds. They are good and
palatable. A hook and line may generally be procured of the
Arabs in the neighbourhood of the lake, and an impromptu
rod may be easily constructed. The best place for ﬁshing is
Et Tabigah, and near the Khan Minyeh Cliff (p. 305).
