THE FLORA OF PALESTINE.

It may be well to give a short account of some of the
numerous forms of vegetation which the remarkably fertile
soil of Syria produces, and the following enumeration (taken
chieﬂy from Dr.Tristram’s papers upon the Flora of Palestine)
while not professing to be by any means exhaustive, may be
useful to the non-scientiﬁc.

The Desert of f7udcea is covered in times of drought with
dwarf herbs and shrubs, mostly hightly aromatic; dull in
colour, with the exception of the Salicomia, or soap plant.
All afford plentiful food for camels. After rain there is '
temporarily a great increase in the vegetation; the dwarf
bushes throw out scented labiate ﬂowers, and cotyledons and
bulbs make .their appearance, with several Species of mig-
nonette (Reseda), sweet stock (Mathiola odomtissz'ma), the
desert astragali (akin to our furze and broom), garlic, and
saffron (a small species of crocus). A few palm trees may
be seen beside the wells, and occasionally the 'l‘huya, a kind
of juniper, probably the thyme tree of Rev. xviii. 12. Heath
bushes, and thesavin juniper bush (yuniperus salzz'na) are to
be met with. Locusts and bees abound in this region.

The undulatimg downs near Beersheba are devoid of trees
and bushes, but covered with brightly-coloured plants, such
as the malva, marigold (Chrysanthemum coronarz'um), aSpho-
del, grape hyacinth, calendula, purple scorzonera, blue
anchusa, stocks, and Star of Bethlehem.

The South Country or “Negeb (fjudcea ” is well covered
with grass and a profusion of ﬂowers, among which are
several crocuses, ixia (Ixolirion montanum), narcissus, scilla,
fritillaria, iris, Tulipa Gesneriana (P), Eryngeum, Lotus
