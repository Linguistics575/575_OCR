250 JERUSALEM TO SAMARIA.

Jacob’s Well

is ,a very sacred spot. Its authenticity has never been
doubted. There can be no doubt that it was here that
our Saviour sat. Around us are the corn-ﬁelds to which
He pointed when He said, “Lift up your eyes, and
look on the ﬁelds, for they are white already to harvest”
(John iv. 3 5). Over there to the right is the parcel of ground
that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. There is the opening
between the two hills, with just a_ glimpse of Shechem
beyond 3 there on the left is Gerizim, to which the woman
of Samaria pointed, as she said, “ Our fathers worshipped in
this mountain.” “ The well is not what we understand by
that name. It is not a spring of water bubbling up from the
earth, nor is it reached by an excavation. It is a shaft cut ‘
in the living rock, about nine feet in diameter, and now
upwards of seventy feet deep. As an immense quantity
of rubbish has fallen into it, the original depth must
have been much greater, probably twice what it is now.
It was therefore intended by its ﬁrst engineer as a
reservoir, rather than as a means of reaching a spring.
Then again, if any wall, as some suppose, once sur-
rounded its mouth, on which the traveller could rest, it is
now gone. The mouth is funnel-shaped, and its sides are
formed by the rubbish of old buildings, a church having
once been erected over it. But we can descend this funnel
and enter a cave, as it were, a few feet below the surface,
which is the remains of a small dome that once covered the
mouth. Descending a few feet, we perceive in the ﬂoor an
aperture partly covered by a ﬂat stone, and leaving suﬁcient
space through which we can look into darkness.”—
