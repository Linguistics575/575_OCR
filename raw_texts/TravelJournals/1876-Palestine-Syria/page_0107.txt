APPROACHING JERUSALEM. 89

From Kolonieh to Jerusalem is a journey of one
and a half hours—~about four and a half miles—and is nearlv
all the way up hill. Near to the top the village of Lifta, is
seen in a deep valley on the left. As the wild high table-
land in the neighbourhood is approached, the traveller may
well reﬂect on the associations connected with the road he is

to Bethlehem, and leaving Jerusalem until they shall make
their entry by way of Jericho—*that is unquestionably the
ﬁnest view, and the sight is overwhelming. But it is
tantalizing, too, to be within a stone’s throw of the Holy
City and not to visit it at once.

From the hill top there is a good view of the Moun-
