shores of the Lake of Gennesaret. The plain on which it
stands is easily accessible from the lake, and from that plain
to the summit is but a few minutes’ walk. The platform
at the top is evidently suitable for the collection of a multi-
tude, and corresponds precisely to the level? place (Luke vi. I7,
mistranslated ‘ plain ’), to which He would ‘ come down,’ as
from one of its higher horns, to address the people. Its
situation is central, both to the peasants of the Galilean hills
and the ﬁshermen of the Galilean lake, between which it
stands, and would, therefore, be a natural resort both to
‘ Jesus and His disciples,’ when they retired for solitude from
the shore of the sea, and also to the crowds who assembled
‘from Galilee, from Decapolis, from Jerusalem, from Judaea,
‘ and from beyond Jordan.’ ?’ (Compare Matt. iv. 25, v. 1
with Luke vi. 17—20.) ‘

Near here Saladin, in July, I 187, defeated the Crusaders.
It was their last struggle. At. nightfall they gathered together
by the Horns of Hatt’in ;‘ Guy of Lusignan, with Rayna'ld of .
Chatillon, the Grand-Master of the Knights Templars, and
the Bishop of Lydda, bearing the Holy Cross. That day,
however, was the triumph of the Muslim, and the power
of the Crusaders in the Holy Land was broken for ever.
King Guy was taken prisoner; Chatillon, to whom Saladin
owed many a bitter grudge, was slain; and all the mighty
army of noble knights, whose deeds of valour have a charm
for all, and have been faithfully chronicled by Michaud, were
slain, or taken prisoners.

Proceeding towards Tiberias, we enter upon a ridge of
hills, beautifully level, and presenting a ﬁne opportunity for
a canter, there being nothing particularly to engage the atten-
tion of the tourist until he comes to a spot where a mag-
niﬁcent View is obtained of the Sea of Galilee and its
surroundings. This view has been described by everyone
