264 - SAMARIA.

the compact between the starving women—“ Give thy son,
that we may eat him to-day, and we will eat my son to-
morrow ;”——and (2) of the " four leprous men who sat at the
entering in of the gate, and said one to another, Why sit we
here until we die? ” and then entering into the city, found
“ there was no man there, neither voice of man," for the
Syrians had ﬂed in terror, even for their life. Again and
again the city was besieged, and ultimately it was captured
by the Assyrians, in the reign of Hosea, the inhabitants
being carried into captivity (2 Kings xvii. 24). After various
revivals, the city was taken by John Hyrcanus. Pompey
restored it to Syria, and Augustus gave it to Herod the
Great, who rebuilt it with great magniﬁcence, and named it
Sebaste (the Greek translation of the Latin name Augustus).

It was to this Samaria that St. Philip came, preaching
the gospel. “ Then Philip went down to the city of
Samaria, and preached Christ unto them. And the people
with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip
Spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. . . .
And there was great joy in that city ” (Acts viii. 5—8). As
N ﬁbulus grew in importance, Sebaste began to decay, and
ﬁnally declined until it has become as a heap of ruins. “ Woe
to the crown of pride . . whose glorious beauty is a
fading ﬂower ” (Isaiah xxviii. I).

In walking through the village of Sebast’iyeh, the traveller
will not fail to notice how traces of ancient buildings are to
be found even built up into the most miserable hovels, so
that even in some bare and ﬁlthy rooms, may beseen slender
shafts of columns, or curiously wrought capitals, intended
once to please the eyes of kings. There are many interesting
(if genuine) sites pointed out, such as the gate where the
lepers sat; the palace of Ahab, the temple of Herod, the old
market, etc. The principal sight is the Church of St. John,
