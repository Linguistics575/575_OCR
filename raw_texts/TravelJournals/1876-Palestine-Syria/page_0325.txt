ET-TABIGAH. 305

country of His disciples ; His chosen retreat when He hid
himself from His foes; His miracles and His sublime lessons
have consecrated these solitudes. The charm of this land-
scape is felt still in our own day, and is reﬂected in the
simple story of the Evangelists. We are carried back to the
life on its shores by the parable of the net, by that of the lost
sheep, by the image of the sheep-fold, and the beautiful
lesson of the lilies. These ﬂowers, more glorious than
Solomon’s purple, still abound . . . .”——(Ritter Erdkunda.)

The boat will soon now run into a narrow little creek,
and the traveller will ﬁnd himself at ’Ain et Tin, or the
Fountain of the Fig-tree, a pleasant spot, and not an
unsuitable one for camping. There is a small spring here,
inferior, however, to the adjacent Et-Tabigah (see below)-
A little to the north of the spring is Khan Minyeh, a ruin
now, but built, without doubt, for the convenience of travellers
to Damascus. Near here are some ruins which Dr. Robinson
considers to be the remains of Capernaum. MacGregor, of
The ROI) Roy, considers Khan Minyeh to be the site of
Capernaum, while others regard it as the site of Bethsaida
(not Bethsaida Julius, p. 460).

Every inch of the ground from here to the Jordan is full
of intense interest, and as the traveller passes in succession
from the ispring to the cliff of Khan Minyeh, observing the.
excavations in the rock, marking the course of the old
aqueduct, and thence to Et-Tabigah, Tell-Hum, and Kerazeh,
he will, without doubt, be treading the ground trodden by
the Saviour.

Et-Tabig‘ah.—“ Westward, along the shore of the lake,
a mile and a half from Tell-Hum, is the charming little bay
of Et-Tabigah, and the great spring which is, without a

doubt, the Fountain of Capharnaum mentioned by Josephus
