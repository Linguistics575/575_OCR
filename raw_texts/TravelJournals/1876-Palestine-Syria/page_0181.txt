MONASTERIES. 161

German Protestant Chapel. Service is performed
here every Sunday morning. Excavations, made at the
expense of the Crown Prince of Prussia, to whom the
Sultan in 1869 gave half the Hospital——-the whole occupies
about 180 square yards—have been carried on for some years,
and visitors are allowed to descend to the foundations and
inspect the vaulted cisterns and other objects of interest. The
rubbish accumulated here was enormous, and was emptied
into the valley of Gihon, near the Jaﬁa Gate.

The Abyssinian Monastery

is close to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; from the Dome
in the Court we can see into the Chapel of St. Helena (p. 127).
Here is an olive tree, which the monks point out as marking
the spot where Abraham found “ the ram caught in the
thicket,” and was offered in sacriﬁce in lieu of Isaac. The
dwellings of these poor people are in the south-eastern part
of the court. Their Chapel is modern and uninteresting.
The Abyssinians are a devout body of Christians, passionately
attached to the Sacred City, and they seem to know of no
higher felicity than to live and die where their Lord lived
and died.

The Coptic Monastery

is much ﬁner than the Abyssinian, to which it is adjacent.
The priests reside here, and there are many cells arranged for
the accommodation of pilgrims. Two Coptic priestsare day
and night shut up in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre
(p. 126), to perform service there. Here is kept the key
of the Cisterns of St. Helena, hewn in the solid rock,
and having a balustrade by the cisterns, also rock-hewn.
They are well worth visiting, and the small fee paid will
be well employed.
