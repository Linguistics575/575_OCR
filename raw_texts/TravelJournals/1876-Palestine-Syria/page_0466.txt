imposing mass of mined buildings, in the midst of which
dwell a few families. When the Romans ruled in Syria, it
was the most celebrated of their fortresses east of Jordan.
Portions of the solid walls, ﬁfteen feet in thickness and
thirty in height, with occasional square towers, are still perfect.
These walls enclosed a rectangular space, a mile and a half
long by a mile broad, but outside the enclosure were exten-

city, terminating at each end in a ﬁne gateway, other streets
cross at right angles. This shows the regular way in which
the Romans rebuilt the city during their supremacy. But
when Bostra, as the Romans called it, came under Muslim
power, little shops and houses were clustered anywhere and
everywhere till a maze of crooked lanes took the place of the
beautiful Roman city. At the present day, the architecture
of the various epochs, from the Rephaim to the Saracens
is strangely mingled, Votive tablets and inscriptions of all
kinds—Pagan, Christian, and Mahomedan—abound in every

of a splendid Theatre, where the luxurious legionaries of
Imperial Rome amused their leisure during their occupancy
of this distant provincial fortress. From the Keep there is
a grand view of the plains of Bashan and Moab, studded
with numerous towns and cities, with good roads connect-
ing the more important places, the soil richly fertile and
yet desolate, given over to the robber tribes of the desert.
Um-el-j‘emal, the Beth-gamul of Scripture is visible from this
