162 JERUSALEM.

The Greek Monastery

is a large range of buildings in Christian Street. It contains
ﬁve churches and a valuable library. The Patriarch and a
hundred monks reside here. At the time of the Easter
Festivals, the Monastery is crowded with Pilgrims, who
are also accommodated at other times.

[For other Monasteries, outside the city, see p. 184.]

The Bazaars.

The Bazaars of Jerusalem have nothing about them to
call for special remark, especially if the traveller has been in
Cairo, or is going to Damascus. The Corn Market is
in David Street, and it is said they give Scripture measure, as
they always shake the measure, press it down, and cause it
to run over. “ Give, and it shall be given unto you, good
measure pressed down, and shaken together, and running
over” (Luke vi. 38). Near the Corn Market are the prin-
cipal bazaars,but there are no special objects of attraction in
them.

The Pool of Hezekiah.

From an Arab Café in Christian Street the best view can
be obtained of this pool, which is situate a little south of the
Greek Monastery. It is an immense reservoir, 2.50 feet long
and 150 wide, and is supplied from the Mamilla Pool (p. 184)
at the end of the Valley of Hinnom, the conduit passing
underneath the city wall near the Jaﬁa Gate. It is called
Birket Hamm’dm, or Pool of the Patriarch, as it supplies the
Bath of the Greek Patriarch. There is no deﬁnite evidence
as to this being, as tradition points it out to be, the pool
which Hezekiah made.

A ﬁne view of the pool is obtained from the roof of the
Mediterranean Hotel.
