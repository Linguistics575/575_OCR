BETHLEHEM TO THE DEAD SEA. 213

very old. Tradition afﬁrms that Abram’s oak was standing
here in the time of our Lord, and that this tree was then in
its comparative youth. If the trees we see now in the Garden
of Gethsemane (p. 177) were standing there in the time of
our Lord, it is quite possible that this tree stood where it now

Lord said, “ Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I
do ? ” and then told him of the impending doom of Sodom
