34o DAMASCUS.

On Friday, the Market Day, the crowds are enormous,
and then the “eye of the East ” both sees and is to be seen,
to the best advantage. Then, as in fact on other days,
there will be seen Persians in gorgeous silks, Nubians in
black and white, Greeks in national costume, Jews with
ringlets and without, Bedawin of the desert, pilgrims en
route to Mecca—a marvellous medley, not to be seen any-
where else. The hubbub is generally terriﬁc. “ Now way
must be made for some grandee; now a string of camels
drives the crowd into a mass, or a party of midshipmen just
arrived from Beyrout rush through the bazaars on ﬂeet
donkeys, scattering sherbet stalls as they pass. And in the
midst of it all, the richly-robed merchants sit on the sills of
their shops, smoking their tchibouks and sipping coffee with
the most consummate indifference.” In addition to the
Bazaars, travellers will be interested in visiting the Khéins,
.where wholesale trade is carried on. They are for the most
part owned by merchants of immense wealth, and the car-
pets of Persia, the muslins of India, the prints of Manchester,
etc., etc., form the stock-in-trade.

The Shops are not less curious than the Bazaars or
Khans, some are devoted to water-coolers and earthenware,
some, and these especially worth visiting, for attar of roses.
In the sh0ps devoted to articles of consumption many
peculiarities will be noticed; bakers’ shops are ﬁlled with
thin, warm, ﬂat bread, and cakes; the confectioners’, with
every variety of coloured sweetmeat and pleasant beverages,
supposed to be iced with snow from Lebanon 5 the butchers’
shops, though less tempting, are curious from the way in
which the meat is cut up, and exposed forzsale. The
Restaurants are numerous, and are to be found in the
neighbourhood of the bazaars. Every traveller interested in
these matters, should taste a Damascene outlet, a dish or two
