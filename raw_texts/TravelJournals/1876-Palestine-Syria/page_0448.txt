sand: ‘ Because of the day.’ that has come ‘to cut off from
Tyre and Sidon every helper that remaineth ’ ” (Jer. xlvii. 4).

Jﬁn is a village about six miles north-east of Sidon,
wherein are the ruins of the beautiful palace reared by Lady
Hester Stanhope, the gifted and extraordinary woman
who gained so remarkable an ascendency over the Arab
mind, that in 182! she was offered the crown of
Palmyra. Alphonse de Lamartine and the author of Eothen
both give accounts of interviews with this extraordinary
woman. When the end came the British Consul and
American Missionary rode over from Beyrout, and found
Lady Hester's corpse the sole tenant of her lovely home.
The thirty-seven servants had all ﬂed, carrying with them
whatever they could lay their hands on.

SIDON TO BEYROUT.

This is an eight hours’ journey, and is very fatiguing in
some parts 5 some consider it almost unequalled in Syria for
weariness and want of interest.

After riding half an hour by the shore the N ahr-el-
Auwaly is crossed. This stream ﬂows down from the
Lebanon, amongst the mountain recesses peopled by the
Druses. It is the Bostrenus of the ancients. Here the
traveller leaves the Phoenician plain and the rocky offshoots
of the Lebanon range are encountered. Riding on for about
two and a half hours the Khan Neby deus is reached,
where stands a wely in honour of the Prophet Jonah, who is
said to have been vomited out by a whale on to the dry land
at this Spot. The old road now runs over a bold headland,
being at places deeply cut into the solid rock. Here once
stood the fortress of Platane, near which Antiochus the Great
and Ptolemy fought in 218 8.0.
