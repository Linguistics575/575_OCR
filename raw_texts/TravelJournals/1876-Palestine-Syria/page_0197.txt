GBTHSEMANE. 1 77

“ Creed,” etc., etc. Those who care for such-things should
take a guide with them, and he will point out any number
of traditional sites if he is up to his work.

.—

In order to continue the Tour of the places of interest
outside the Walls of Jerusalem, we will descend,
from the Mount of Olives by the northern road (p. 171), the
way which David ascended when he ﬂed from Absalom.
“And David went up by the ascent of Mount Olivet, and
wept as he went, and had his head covered, and he went
barefoot” (2 Sam. xv. 30). 7

On the western 510pe of Olivet, near the Brook Kidron,
is the ~

Garden of Gethsemane.

The tradition which places it here is of considerable an-
tiquity. Eusebius, Bishop of Caesarea, Speaks of the garden
as well known; Jerome repeats the same testimony. The
space enclosed is about one-third of an acre, and is surrounded
by a wall covered with stucco. It is entered by a gate kept
under lock and key, under the control of the Franciscans.
The eight olive-trees are undoubtedly of great age, and
may have Sprung from the roots of those which were here
in the time of our Lord. In the garden is a reservoir which
supplies water for moistening the ground and cultivating a
few ﬂowers. A series of rude frescoes on the walls represent
scenes in the life of Christ.

The monks point out the Chapel Of the Agony, in
a cave; the rocky place where the disciples slept, the spot
where judas gave the kiss of betrayal.

For a franc a little bouquet of ﬂowers grown in the
garden can be purchased, and a prettier souvenir cannot be

obtained in Jerusalem.
