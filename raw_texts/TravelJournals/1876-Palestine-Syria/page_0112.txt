defenceless allies to be rewarded, before the close of day, by
a signal and decisive victory? It is doubtless so standing
on that lofty eminence, with outstretched hand and Spear, as
on the hill above Ai, that the hero appears in the ancient
song of the “Book of the Heroes.”

“ Then Spoke Joshua unto Jehovah,
In the day ‘ that God gave up the Amorite
Into the hand of Israel ' (1n. ),
When he discomﬁted them in Gibeon,
‘ And they were discomﬁted before the face of Israel’ (In)
And Joshua said,
‘ Be thou still, 0 sun, upon Gibeon,
And thou, moon, upon the valley of Ajalon !
And the sun was still,
And the moon stood,
Until the Nation (or, 1xx., ‘ until God ’) had avenged them upon
their enemies. \
And the sun stood in ‘ the very midst’ of the heavens
And hasted not to go down for a whole day. '
And there was no day like that before it or after it,
That Jehovah heard the voice of a man,
For Jehovah fought for Israel.
And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp in
Gilga .”
The route from Beit-’Ur-el-F6ka to El-j‘ib is at ﬁrst very
rocky and" rough. It follows for some distance the course
of a Roman road, which may be traced at intervals. In a
little less than two hours the summit of the hill is attained,
and then there bursts upon the view El-Jib and N eby
Samwil. A plain lies below us, and having crossed it, in
less than half an hour we are at El-Jib, the ancient
Gibeon.
Fine as the view is from Gibeon, that from N eby Samwil
is much ﬁner, and takes in a wealth of historical pictures
second to hardly any in Palestine.
