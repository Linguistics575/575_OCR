THE MOUNT OF- OLIVES. 175

the south-east quarter is the Mosque of Omar, standing in the
centre of the raised platform, or Haram, where Solomon’s
Temple once stood. To the south of it is El Aksa, once a
Christian church built by Justinian. At the north-west
corner of the Temple are the Turkish barracks, where the
Castle of Antonia stood. North of the Temple, or the south-
eastern quarter of the city, is the hill Bezetha; and on it,
near St. Stephen’s Gate, the‘Church of St. Anne. West of
Bezetha is the hill .of Akra, which is the north-west quarter
of the city, and on its eastern slope stands the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre 5 a little to the south-east of it are the ruins
of the Hospital of the Knights of St. John. The bill west of
Mount Moriah, or the south-west quarter of the city, is
Mount Zion; the tower of David, or Hippicus, stands near
the Jaﬁa Gate, and over it waves the Turkish ﬂag. South-

the Armenian Convent, with a white dome. East of the
Convent is the Jewish Quarter, with the two synagogues,
one with a green and one with a white dome. On the top
of Zion, south of the wall, is a cluster of buildings, in the

the Jordan Valley, the course of the river marked by the dark

Evil Counsel ; to the west of it is the Valley of Rephaim.
Near the north-west corner of Jerusalem are the Russian

beyond which is a small village among olive-trees named
Shafat. To the right of it is a hill, the ancient Nob, and
