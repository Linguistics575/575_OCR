2 . INTRODUCTORY.

to be encountered greater than in any part of Europe. Of course
these difﬁculties are not insurmountable even if persons go alone,
or with, perchance, only another; but there is no doubt that in
no other country is the pleasure of a tour so much enhanced by
being associated with a party of friends and acquaintances, or
even of strangers with no other bond than that of being fellow-
tourists in strange and novel scenes, than in Palestine. It must
be remembered that the Tour of Palestine is made on horse-
back, and that the only comfortable way of travelling is by
taking tents and all the necessaries for camp—life. In no other
country in the world are there so many associations which link
' together those who visit it; and in no other country, perhaps,
is the tourist so dependant for the pleasure of a tour on fellow-
travellers. The most enjoyable way of visiting Palestine is
by joining a party. The interest of camp-life is thereby much
enhanced (see p. 7) ; moreover, as a question of expense, it will
often happen that certain costs which would have to be borne
by a single traveller would not be any greater for a party.

MON EY. ~
Any money deposited at the ofﬁces of THOMAS COOK and
SON, will be repaid to the traveller in the currency of the
countries, as required. English gold or French gold is better
than paper in the East. Their circular notes of £ 5 or £10 are
better than Bank of England notes—safer and less liable to
depreciation.
