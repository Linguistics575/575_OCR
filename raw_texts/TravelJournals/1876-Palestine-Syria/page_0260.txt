The traveller will now descend into a valley, the Wady
Suwein’it, and then into the narrow gorge which is the Pass
of Michmash referred to in I Sam. xiv. 4, I 3 (see above).
On a hill to the north-east will be seen the deserted village
of Michmash (Mukhmas), celebrated chieﬂy as being the
scene of Jonathan’s exploit, as recorded above. It is referred

“ And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even
a desolation unto this day.” The whole story is recorded in
