ediﬁce probably dates from the capture of the city by the
Muslims in 634 A.D. A gradual decline followed, and the
city was deserted when the Crusaders arrived in 1142.. A
fortress of the Knights Templars was built, and a new town
sprang up. Saladin captured the city in I 187, and demolished
the fortiﬁcations. Since the departure of the Crusaders, no-

Lachish.

Lachish (impregnable) was an ancient city of the
Canaanites, alloted to the tribe of Judah (Joshua xv. 39). It

and then hanged. Lachish is named amongst the cities that
Rehoboam fortiﬁed (2 Chron. xi. 9). It was the place where
Amaziah was slain by the conSpirators who pursued him
from Jerusalem (2 Kings xiv. 1’9 5 2 Chron. xxv. 27).
