LAND or GENNESARET. 3o 1

The level tract beyond Magdala is the Land Of Gen-
nesaret (Matt. xiv. 34), now called El Ghuweir, or “the
Little Ghor.” The meaning of the name is supposed to
have been either Valley of the Flowers or Gardens of the
Prince. It is about three miles long, and its greatest breadth
is one mile. The soil of the whole tract is extremely fertile,
and although the greater part is over-run with rank weeds,
the cultivated parts supply the markets of Damascus and
Beyrout with the best melons and cucumbers grown in
Palestine. There are thickets of nubk, agnus cactus, and
oleander, growing in such profusion as to make an explora-
tion impossible. It will be remembered that Josephus has a
most glowing description of the Land of Gennesaret, and
as the passage occurs so often in the controversy which has
been going on for the past few years as to the identity of the
site of Capemaum, it will be well to quote it here :—

“ One may call this place the ‘ambition of nature,’
when it forces those plants that are naturally enemies to one
another, to agree together. It is a happy contention of the
seasons, as if every one of them had a claim in this country ;
for it not only nourishes different sorts of autumnal fruits
beyond men's expectations, but preserves them also a great
while. It supplies men with the principal fruits—with
grapes and ﬁgs continually during ten months of the year,
and the rest of the fruits as they become ripe together
through the whole year; for besides the good temperature of
the air, it is also watered from a most fertile fountain. The
people of the country call it Capharnaum.”—(7osephus 111.,
ch. x. 8.)

All this region is sacred with associations connected with
the ministry of our Lord; and it will be well, perhaps, to

quote some of the principal Scripture passages relating to a
place so memorable.
