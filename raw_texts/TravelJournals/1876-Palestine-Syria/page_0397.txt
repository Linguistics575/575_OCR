LEBANON AND THE CEDARS. 377

renowned Cedars are found in a vast recess in the central
ridge of Lebanon, about eight miles in diameter; they stand
alone, with not another tree in sight, at an elevation of at
least 6000 feet above the Mediterranean.

The cedars are about four hundred in number, and they
vary extremely in size, some being very old ; they are in the
centre, and the younger ones cluster round them. There may
not be more than twelve remaining of great antiquity, and a
few of these measure more than forty feet in circumference,
but the trunks are not high. These trees grow less in
number continually, and some travellers do not count so
many as above stated. Dr. Thomson says : “I counted four
hundred and forty-three, and these cannot be far from the
true number.”

Cedars have been recently found also in other parts of
the range. The western slopes of Lebanon are very beauti-
ful, with “ evergreen oaks and pines clothing the mountain's
side, while fig-trees, vines, mulberry, and olive-trees abound
on terraced heights, or in picturesque glens. Corn is culti-
vated in every possible nook, villages nestle among the cliffs,
and convents crown the summits of well-nigh perpendicular
rocks.” (Ag/re.) Wild beasts are, as always, numerous in
the recesses of the range. Fossils abound in the rocks.
Iron and coal have also been found. Compare Deut. viii.
9, xxxiii. 25. In the northern parts the mountain is pe0pled
with Maronite Christians, numbering about 150,000, whose
chief occupation is rearing the silk-worm. Druses occupy
the southern parts, and between these tribes there have been
serious outbreaks. Anti-Libanus is more barren, and more
thinly-pe0pled than the western range. The ruins of this
region are very extensive, and full of interest. One of the
most reliable and earnest explorers tells us that he has visited
more than thirty temples in Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon,
