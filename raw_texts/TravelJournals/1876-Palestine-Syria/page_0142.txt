to have been beside some public thoroughfare. “ They that
passed by reviled Him” (Matt. xxvii. 39).

The story of the removal from the cross and the burial in
the sepulchre is given thus minutely in St. John’s GosPel:
“And after this, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of
Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that
he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him
leave. He came, therefore, and took the body of Jesus.
And there came also Nicodemus, which at the ﬁrst came to
Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes,
about an hundred pound weight. Then took they the body
of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the
manner of Jews is to bury. ' Now in the place where He was
cruciﬁed there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepul-
chre, wherein was never man yet laid. There laid they Jesus
therefore, because of the Jews’ preparation day 5 for the
sepulchre was nigh at hand” (John xix. 38—42). In the
GosPel of St. Mark the additional information is given that
they “laid Him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a
rock, and rolled a stone into the door of the sepulchre ”
(Mark xv. 4.6).

There is no historical evidence that the site of the Holy
Sepulchre was determined until the third century, when it
appears, from Eusebius, that over the Sepulchre had been
erected a Temple of Venus. In the fourth century, the
Empress Helena had a vision, in which she recognized the
site, and by {means of a miracle discovered the true cross
(p. 128). Constantine thereupon built a group of ediﬁces
over the sites, 11.1). 326. These were destroyed by the Persians
in 614; rebuilt, 616. In 936, ﬁre partly destroyed the
church; and the Muslims inﬂicted damage to it in 1010.
The present church was built by the Crusaders, and has
undergone a long series of disasters and rebuilding.
