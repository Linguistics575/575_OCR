BOZRAH. 445

the ﬁrst centuries of the Christian era, are modern in corn-
parison with the colossal-walls and massive stone doors of
the private houses. The simplicity of their style, the low
roofs, the ponderous blocks of roughly hewn stone with
which they are built, the great thickness of the walls and
the heavy slabs which form the ceilings—all point to a period
far earlier than the Roman age, and probably even antecedent
to the conquest of the country by the Israelites. Moses
makes special mention of the strong cities of Bashan, and
speaks of their high walls and gates. He tells us too, in
the same connection that Bashan was called the Land of the
Giants (or Rephaim, Deut. iii. 13), leaving us to conclude
that the cities were built by giants. Now the houses of
Kerioth, and other towns in Bashan, appear to be just such
dwellings as a race of giants would build. The walls, the
roofs, but especially the pouderous gates, doors and bars are
in every way characteristic of a period when architecture
was in its infancy, when giants were masons, and when
strength and security were the grand requisites. I measured
a door in Kerioth: it was nine feet high, four and a half feet
wide, and ten inches thick, one solid mass of stone. I saw
the folding gates of another town in the mountains still
larger and heavier. Time produces little effect on such
buildings as these. The heavy stone slabs of the roof rest-
ing on the massive -walls make the building as ﬁrm as if
built of solid masonry; and the black basalt used is almost
as hard as iron. There can scarcely be a doubt therefore
that these are the very cities erected and inhabited by the
Rephaim, the aboriginal occupants of Bashan; and the
language of Ritter remains to be true, ‘ These buildings
remain as eternal witnesses to the conquest of Bashan by
Jehovah.’ ”
