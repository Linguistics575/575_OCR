452 TOURS EAST OF THE JORDAN.

could be recognized; but we were never able to make out
the sea to the north of it; and though it is certainly possible
that it might be seen from this elevation, I could not satisfy
myself that I saw more than the haze over the Plain of
Esdraelon ..... A corner of the Hermon mountains
(Bashan) could be caught in a depression of the Gilead
range. Hermon certainly could be made out in a clear
atmosphere over the Jordan valley, the whole of which lay
open as far as Kurn Surtabeh 5 but the haze rendered it very
indistinct, if, indeed, we saw it at all. However, after test-
ing repeatedly, every view in the neighbourhood, I am per-
fectly satisﬁed that there is none which equals in extent that
from Nebo, i.e., from the ﬂat ridge which rises slightly
about half-a-mile behind the ruined city, and which I take
to be the true ‘ Field of Zophim, the top of Pisgah.’

“ From Nebo we looked down on our right northwards,
into the Wady Ayun Moussa (Springs of Moses), which
rises to the north-east of it, and runs into the Ghor Seisaban'
(Plains of Shittim) opposite Beth Jesunoth. In the lower
part of its course it is called Wady Jerifeh. It was dotted
with trees, bright green Spots, and occasional patches of cul-
tivation, wherever it was more open than usual.

“ By this Wady would be the natural ascent to N ebo from
the plains below ; and by it, doubtless, Moses ascended with
Joshua to the crest of the range. We could trace the line of
the path the whole way up. Three other ravines, up which
there are paths, lead from the same plain to the heights;
one by the Wady Heshbon to the north of Ayun Mousse;
and the Wady Na’ur, north of this again, the largest of all
these valleys. The furthest up is the Wady N ’meirah.
But these are all too far north to have led to any point which
can afford such a panorama as that from Nebo. Indeed,
there can scarcely now remain a doubt on the mind of any
