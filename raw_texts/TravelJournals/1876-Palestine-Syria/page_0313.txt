TIBERIAS. 293

The descent to Tiberias is very steep, and the traveller
will be struck with the change in temperature, reminding
him of the descent into the Valley of the Jordan. The views
are interesting, e3pecially as the old walled town of Tiberias
makes a picturesque foreground to the scenery of the lake.

TIBERIAS-

Tiberias is not mentioned in the New Testament, and
there is no reason to believe that it was ever visited by our
Lord. The only reference to it is in one or two verses speak-
ing of the “Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias”
(John vi. I, xxi. I). It was built by Herod Antipas, A.D.
20, and was dedicated by him to the Emperor Tiberias. It
is doubtful whether there was ever an older city on this site.
It soon became the chief city of the province of Galilee;
many handsome buildings adorned it, amongst them a royal
palace and an amphitheatre. After the destruction of Jeru-
salem it became the seat of the Jews. In the second cen-
tury the Sanhedrim was removed here from Sepphoris, and
for a long time it was noted for its Rabbinical School. Here
the Mishna and Masorah, the principal traditional works of
the Jews, were published. Its subsequent history is merely
that of captures by Persians, Arabs, and Crusaders.

The modern town of Tiberias does not occupy so large a
space as the ancient 5 it is partially surrounded by a wall,
which was shaken and 'nearly destroyed in the great earth-
quake of 1837, when half the people of the town perished.
It is a ﬁlthy town, and, but for one or two things in it, had
better be avoided. Moreover, it abounds with ﬂeas, and has
become a proverb in this respect. The population is over
three thousand, nearly two thousand of whom are Jews.
They will be easily recognized; many of them wear im-
mense black hats, many wear their hair in ringlets, and
