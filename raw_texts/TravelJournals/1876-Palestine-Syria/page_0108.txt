In Tasso’s fferusalem Delivered he thus describes the

emotions of the Crusaders on their ﬁrst view of the Holy

City :-— '

“ With holy zeal their swelling breasts abound,
And their winged footsteps scarcely print the ground,
When now the sun ascends th’ ethereal way,
And strikes the dusty ﬁeld with warmer ray.
Behold, Jerusalem in prospect lies !
Behold, Jerusalem salutes their eyes I
At once a thousand tongues repeat the name,
All hail Jerusalem with loud acclaimr

“ At ﬁrst transported with the pleasing sight,
Each Christian bosom glowed with full delight ;
But deep contrition soon their joys opprest,
And holy sorrow saddened every breast.
Scarce dare their eyes the city walls survey,
Where clothed in ﬂesh their dear Redeemer lay ;
Whose sacred earth did once their Lord enclose,
And where triumphant from the grave He rose. "

Jada Gate (p. 144).
