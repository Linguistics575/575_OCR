3 50 DAMASCUS

“ Achmed Pasha, the governor and military commander of
Damascus, convicted on the evidence of a certain Saleh Zechy
Bey, a Mahomedan—who boldly came forward and accused
him of gross dereliction of duty, and of having, by his
cowardice and impotence, caused the massacre, was shot.
Three Turkish ofﬁcers, who were present at the massacre at
Hasbaya, and a hundred and seventeen individuals—chieﬂy
Bashi-Bazouks, police, and wandering characters—~met with
the same fate. About four hundred of the lower orders were
condemned to imprisonment and exile. Of the citizens,
ﬁfty-six were hanged. Of the notables, eleven were exiled
to Cyprus and Rhodes, and their pr0perty sequestered for
the time being. It has since been restored to their families.
These notables are living in their places of exile with all the
comforts and luxuries of life 5 one of them has celebrated his
marriage. A sum of about £200,000 was pr0posed to be
levied on the city, which three or four of its principal
merchants could furnish alone with ease.

“ Such is all the amount of retribution which outraged
Christian Europe has been able to obtain for the wanton
plundering and burning to the ground of the whole Christian
Quarter of Damascus, entailing a loss to that unfortunate
community of at least £2,000,000 sterling— for the in-
human, savage, and cold-blooded massacre of 6000 in-
offensive Christians, who possessed no arms whatever; for
the ravishing of their wives and daughters; and for the ex-
pulsion from their desolated hearths of 20,000 beggared and
defenceless victims of Mahomedan rage and fanaticism,
whose only crime was, to use the words of the British
consul, ‘ that they were the followers of Christ.’ ”

The Protestant Mission is in this quarter of
the city, and will be visited by all travellers with inte-
rest.
