TYRE. 41 9

unto slavery “in 3 32 13.0., and that, according to Strabo,
it recovered its greatness and its trade again in 262 13.0.,
exactly seventy years after, the prophecy of Isaiah seems
most remarkably fulﬁlled—not, as may be supposed, in
contradistinction to the prophecy of Ezekiel, but in exact
accordance, the one having reference to the Tyre island,
which, as it were, running away into the sea from the threat
of divine indignation denounced by Ezekiel, met there the
danger predicted by Isaiah, which was fulﬁlled after the time
of Ezekiel, as if the mercy of God was Seen in ﬁrst pro-
nouncing its total destruction, and yet depriving it of only a
part of its greatness as a warning before executing the threat.”
Of the Macedonian successors of Alexander, the Seleucidae,
traces are found on coins and ruins. In the ﬁrst century
before the Christian era, Strabo describes Tyre as still ﬂourish-
ing; its trade was now chieﬂy in the production of the
famous Tyrian purple from the rnurex. In the New Testa-
ment little is said of Tyre. Our Saviour visited “ the coasts
thereof,” and named the town in-his warning to Bethsaida
and Chorazin. Paul on one occasion set sail from Tyre, and
a touching description is given of the parting. He was on
his way to Jerusalem, after a sorrowful parting with the
elders at Ephesus, when he “landed at Tyre, for there the
ship was to unlade her burden. And finding disciples, we
tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit
that he should not go up to Jerusalem. And when we had
accomplished these days we departed and went our way ;
and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children,
till we were out of the city, and we kneeled down on the
shore and prayed. And when we had taken our leave one
of another, we took ship, and they returned home again.”
Under the Romans, Tyre maintained some degree of
prosperity. In the fourth century it was a Christian town.
