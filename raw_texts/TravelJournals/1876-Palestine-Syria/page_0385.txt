BA’ALBEK T0 BEYROUT. 365

is a problem which the science of our own day fails to
unravel.

The Circular Temple is close to the modern village.
It is a gem in its exterior, but has nothing remarkable inside.
Eight Corinthian columns, each a monolith, surround it,
while a richly-executed frieze of ﬂowers adorns the wall of the
cella. The entablature is heavily laden with decoration.
-As late as a century ago Christians of the Greek Church
worshipped here, but a century hence it is probable the
Circular Temple will be no more.

A traveller who had but recently passed through Palestine
has thus described his impressions: “ There are many things
to wonder at and admire in Ba’albek. One never wearies
of gazing upon those graceful ruins, beautiful from every
aSpect and in every light; but it is not ‘on holy ground ’
that we are standing, and with the inﬂuences Upon us which
the ruins of Palestine have created, we forget the might of
thnician strength, the poetry of Grecian architecture, the
pomp of Roman power, and sigh to think that all this mag-
niﬁcence was pride, this worship pagan, and all this skill and
grace and beauty deﬁled by voluptuous and soul-destroying
sin. I climbed a wall and sat upon a richly-sculptured
parapet, watching the sunset. To the left was Hermon, to
the right Lebanon, and at my feet the whole vast area of ruins.
It was an hour full of suggestion, and one could not fail to
trace how the word of the Lord was receiving its fulﬁlment;
how the false systems were lying in the dust and darkness,
while His own prophetic proclamation was gaining daily new
force and power: ‘ I am the light of the world.’ ”

The journey from Ba’albek to Shtora (p. 3 56), on the
Damascus road, is a good seven hours’ journey.
