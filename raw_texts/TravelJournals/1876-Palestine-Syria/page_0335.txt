KEDESH-NAPHTALI. 3 1 5

burnt Hazor with ﬁre ” (Joshua xi.) It was the only city
‘ burnt, the reason being that it was probably too strong to be
left standing. It was afterwards rebuilt (1 Kings ix. 15),
and its inhabitants were carried by Tiglath-Pileser t0 Assyria
(2. Kings xv. 2.9). Hazor was the residence of another king,
Jabin, the captain of whose host was Sisera. and who was
defeated by Deborah and Barak (Judges iv. 2— 17).

The next place of interest passed on this route is Kedes,
the ancient Kedesh-Naphtali. The situation of the
place is exceedingly pretty and picturesque, and the ruins
upon its site are interesting, although their date is very
doubtful. They consist of foundations of buildings, a few
walls and arches, and anumber of sarcophagi, some of which,
as at Kefr Kenna, are used as drinking-troughs. There is
also a curious octagonal column, and some richly-sculptured
ornaments.

Kedesh-Naphtali was a Canaanitish town, given to the
tribe of N aphtali, and afterwards to the Levites, when it was
made a city of_refuge (Joshua xxi. 32). It would appear that,
in the time of the Canaanites, the city was a sanctuary, or
holy place, as it afterwards became under the Israelites. It
was here that Barak lived, and gathered together his army
for the battle of Tabor (Judges iv. 6—9). Here, too, dwelt
Heber the Kenite. Like Hazor, Kedesh was captured by
Tiglath—Pileser, and the people carried captives to Assyria.

From Kedes to Safed is ten miles, and to the north-west
of the upper part of Lake Hﬁleh four miles.

Proceeding on our journey, we reach a large village
named Més-el-Jebel, and then through most picturesque
scenery, with splendid distant views, comprehending the
Valley of the Jordan, the Plain and Lake of Hﬁleh, the
whole range of Hermon, the Castle of Tibnin, and innu-
merable hills and valleys, with villages studded here and
