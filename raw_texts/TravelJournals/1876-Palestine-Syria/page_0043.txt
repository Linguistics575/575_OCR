Itinerary, or deviations may be made at discretion. Either‘way
by Kirjath-Jearim, or Beth-Horon, may be taken to Jerusalem, or
it would bepracticable to go southward to Philistia, reversing
one or other of the Itineraries, already given, round by Gaza, or
Gath to Hebron, and thence to Jerusalem. In forty days this
might be accomplished.

routes in the Land of Moab, and one in the Hauran to the East
of Damascus.
