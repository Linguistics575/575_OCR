BEYROUT. 36,)

jurisprudence of the Romans, may be computed to have
lasted from the third to the middle of the sixth century
(Gibbon ii. 94).

When the Saracens overran Syria, Beyrout fell into their
hands, and during the wars of the Crusaders it often changed
hands. It was captured by Baldwin I. in 1100, and was
occupied for some time by Saladin. The Druse prince,
Fakhr-ed-D’in, made it his residence in I 595, and was in-
strumental in raising it from the low state into which it had
fallen.

In 1840, Beyrout was bombarded by the English, and
recaptured for the Turks. After the massacres of 1860
many Christians came and settled here, and from that date
the prosperity of Beyrout has been greater than in any
previous period of its history. There are scarcely any sights
for the traveller to see. The Bazaar does not present any
of those Oriental features which are so attractive in other
Eastern towns. The principal Mosque is closed. The
only ancient structure is the Tower near the harbour. The
houses are of semi-European build, and the costumes of
semi—European cut.

Beyrout is famous for its missionary and philanthropic
institutions, and every traveller will do well to visit them,
as they represent a great power which will revolutionize
Syria.

The Syrian Protestant College has departments
in Arabic Literature, Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Modern
Languages, Moral Science, Biblical Literature, Medicine,
Surgery, Jurisprudence, etc. ; it is under the general control
of trustees in the United States, where the present funds are
invested 5 but its local affairs are administered by a Board of
Managers, composed of American and British Missionaries
and residents in Syria and Egypt.
