in the time of sickness, sending to enquire of Baal-Zebub,
the god of Ekron, “ whether I shall recover of this disease 2 "

Paradise Regained, he says that the “ desert shall blossom as
the rose: the glory of Lebanon shall be given to it ; the
excellency of Carmel and of Sharon ” (Isaiah xxxv. 2.). He
describes this “excellency of Carmel” in another passage,
