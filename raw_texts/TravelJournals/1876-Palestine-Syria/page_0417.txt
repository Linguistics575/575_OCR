GAZA T0 JERUSALEM. 397

terraces are seen, and the ruined village of Beit ’Alam is
passed. A valley is soon reached, on the two banks of which
stand the two separated portions of ldhna (ancient Jedna),
with the road running between.

Leaving the picturesque ridges and valleys of the hill
country stretching away behind him towards the Philistian
plain, the traveller now enters, by the Wady-el-Feranj, into
the recesses of the central range of the Judaean mountains.
Leaving the road to Taiyibeh on the left, and the road to
Dﬁra on the right, a zig-zag road conducts the traveller due
east to qudh. There is an ancient village with ruins of old
defences, and picturesquely situated amidst its vineyards and
olives. To the south-west the Neby Nﬁh is seen, marking
the position of Dﬁra (ancient Adoraim, two dwellings), for-
tiﬁed by Rehoboam (2 Chron. xi. 9).

Teﬁﬁh is identiﬁed as Beth-Tapp uah, “ House of Apples,”
joshua xv... 5 3. In I Chron. ii. 4.3, Tappuah is mentioned as
a son of Hebron.

Proceeding from Teffﬁh, the summit of the ridge is soon
gained, and the traveller stands on one of the highest points
in Palestine; hence the descent into the Valley of Eshcol
(p. 208) is speedily effected.

There is another route from Beit Jibrin to Hebron by
Terkz’imieh (the ancient city and bish0p‘s see of Tricomias)
and Taiyibeh, joining the former route near the summit of
the mountain ridge.

GAZA T0 JERUSALEM.

Gaza to Beit Jibrin (see pp. 392—394).

Beit Jibrin to Jerusalem is an easy stage of eight hours,
but if time can possibly be spared, it is desirable to prolong
the journey by exploring the interesting localities lying on
the north-West side of the ancient road.
