433 THE HAURA‘N.

honour by the chief captain of the 16th Legion, in the reigns
of Aurelius and Lucius Verne; ruins of an old mosque; a
portion of a hippodrome, and a small temple with a well-
preserved crypt. Near this latter building is the Theatre,
the most perfect monument of antiquity in Shuhba. The
details of the arrangements of Roman buildings of this
character can here be readily studied. The street referredto
as conducting to the remains enumerated is at one place out

In other parts of the city are fragments of many grand
buildings, but they are for the most part involved in almost

with portions of an aqueduct in connection. Greek inscrip-

south and east of the city are very little injured.

Close to Shuhba is an extinct volcanic crater, with
abundance of scoriae, ashes, etc. The view from this point

glory, winter streams then irrigated and enriched the slopes,
and ﬁlled the great cisterns in every city; but the Lord said
in his wrath, ‘I will make waste mountains and hills, and

and I will dry up the pools ’ (Isa. xlii. I 5), and now I saw
that the words of the Lord were literally and fearfully true.”

Following the Roman road from Shuhba along the lower
slopes of the Jebel Haurﬁn, Murddle, Ri'meh, and other villages
are passed on the right and left, and also the ruins of the large
