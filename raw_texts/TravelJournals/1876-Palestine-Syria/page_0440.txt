42° ACRE 'ro TYRE.

Eusebius delivered a celebrated oration here, possibly in the
church of which the ruins are still seen. In the seventh
century, when the Muslim swept the Eastern plains, Tyre
became a Mahomedan city, and remained so till the time of
the Crusades. It again came into Christian hands in 1124..
In 1290, the German Emperor, Frederick Barbarossa, was
buried in the cathedral after losing his life through his horse
sinking in a river whilst in pursuit of the Turks. “ At this
period,” says Dr. Smith, “there was perhaps no city in the
known world which had stronger claims than Tyre to the
title of the ‘Eternal City.’ Tyre had been the parent of
cities which at a distant period had enjoyed a long life and
had died; and it had survived more than ﬁfteen hundred
years its greatest colony, Carthage. It had outlived Egyptian
Thebes, and Babylon, and Ancient Jerusalem. It had seen
Grecian cities rise and fall. Rome, it is true, was still in
existence in the thirteenth century ; but in comparison with
Tyre, Rome itself was of recent date."

In,1291, after having been occupied by the Christians for
a century and a half, news came to Tyre of the taking of
Acre by storm by the Sultan of Egypt and Damascus. “On
the same day on which Ptolemais (Acre) was taken,” says
a Venetian historian, “the Tyrians, at vespers, leaving the
city empty, without the stroke of a sword, without the tumult
of war, embarked on board their vessels, and abandoned the
city to be occupied freely by their conquerors. On the
morrow the Saracens entered, no one attempting to prevent
them, and they did what they pleased.”

Tyre has never since recovered itself. It fell into ruins ;
in 1697, a traveller states that he saw “ not so much as one
entire house left.” In the latter part of last century the
place was partially rebuilt, and now contains a population of
about three thousand.
