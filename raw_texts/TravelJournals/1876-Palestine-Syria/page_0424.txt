every direction, and the conﬂagration spreading from stream
to stream until the whole plain was one sheet of ﬂame. Poor
Samson was betrayed at last :—
“ ‘ Ask for this great deliverer now, and ﬁnd him

Eyeless in Gaza, at the mill with slaves,

Himself in bonds, under Philistian yoke.’

“ Fatal bondage his to the Philistine lords. Savage cruelty
theirs, but to be returned tenfold on their own devoted
heads ! Thus does Milton describe the last act of Samson’s
life :—

“ ‘ Oh, dearly bought revenge, yet glorious !
Living or dying thou hast fulﬁlled
The work for which thou wast foretold
To Israel, and now liest victorious
Among thy slain, self-killed ;
Not willingly, but tangled in the fold
Of dire necessity, whose law in death conjoined
Thee with thy slaughtered foes, in numbers more
Than all thy life had slain before.’

“ Samson’s mangled body was brought up from Gaza by
his brethren, and buried on his native hill ‘ between Zorah
,and Eshtaol ’ (Judges xvi. 31).”
