THE BAZAARS. ' 339

so often in Palestine—is very attractive. There are a variety
of specialities to be obtained here, such as worked table-
cloths; the Bedaw’in ’Abayeh, or bernouse; silk scarfs, and
elegant tobacco pouches. In the Old Clo’ Bazaar, where
second-hand clothes and other articles are sold by mock
auction, is a centre of attraction, and there is generally a-
great deal of amusement to be made out of a visit. The
Fez Bazaar should be visited, as it will reveal all the arts
and mysteries of turbans, caps worn under the fez, and the
paraphernalia of oriental head-gear. The Greek Bazaar
is one of the most attractive, as- here antiquities of all kinds
are sold, and “Damascus blades ” may be bought to the
usual disadvantage. Some are really exceedingly pretty,
the handles being wrought with all kinds of cunning'work-
manship. The “ coffee sets ” sold here are very choice 3 the
cups are so small that ﬁve or six of them would only ﬁll
an ordinary English coffee-cup. These little vesSels are
beautifully painted or set in stones, and are ﬁtted into deli-
cately carved, thin, metallic receivers for handing to guests.

In addition to these there is the Tobacco Bazaar,
where pipes, mouth-pieces, and such like things, can be
obtained; the Booksellers’ Bazaar, where none but
Mahomedan books are sold 3 the COppersmith’s Ba-
zaar, where, if the traveller can endure the noise, he will
behold some wonderful dishes and culinary utensils 5 the Boot
and Shoe Bazaar, where, as in Constantinople, richly
decorated slippers and shoes can be obtained, and the yellow
leather slippers, which ladies are fond of possessing on account
of their softness. Without minutely describing the various
bazaars in detail, it may be said that there are bazaars for
every branch of trade and manufacture, and that the traveller
may purchase anything he may require, from a shoe latchet
to a camel. -
