VALLEY or HINNOM. 165

border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the
south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem : and the
border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before
the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the
valley of the giants northward.” It is even more clearly
deﬁned in Joshua xviii. I6: “ And the border came down to
the end of the mountain that lieth before the valley of the son
of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of the giants on the
north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom to the side of
Jebusi on the south, and descended to En-rogel ” (p. 167).

In this valley, or rather on the southern brow overlooking
it on the eastern end, Solomon built the high places to
Molech. “ Then did Solomon build an high place for Che-
mosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before
Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children
of Ammon ” (1 Kings xi. 7). Other idolatrous kings fol-
lowed up the practices commenced by Solomon, so that Ahaz
and Manasseh did not Spare their own sons, “ but made them
to pass through the ﬁre according to the abominations of the
heathen ” (2 Kings xvi. 3 ; 2 Chron. xxviii. 3, xxxiii. 6). In
the time of Josiah these hellish practices of infant sacriﬁce
were put down with so strong a hand, that they were never
revived here. “ He deﬁled Topheth (or Tophet, place of ﬁre),
which is in the valley of the Children of Hinnom, that no
man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the
ﬁre to Molech ” (2 Kings xxiii. Io). . And “ he took away
the high places that were before Jerusalem."

So odious was the place made by the horrid practices of
the idolaters, and by the pollution to which Josiah subjected
it, by making it a ceSSpool and a charnel-house, that later
Jews called it Ge Hinnom, or Gehenna, making it symbolical
of the place of eternal torment. Its present name is Wédy
Jehcnnain, and the lower half of the valley, Wédy er Rubib.
