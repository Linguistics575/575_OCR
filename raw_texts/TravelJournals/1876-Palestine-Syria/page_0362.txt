342 DAMASCUS.

been pointed out by good authorities that this building, so
venerated by the followers of the prophet, exhibits three dis-
tinct styles of architecture, marking three great epochs in its
history, and proclaiming the three great dynasties that had
successively possessed it. First of all it had been a heathen
temple, and its massive stones, and beautiful arches and
gate, proclaim Grecian or Roman architecture. Whether-
the temple was built by the Seleucidae, the successors
of Alexander the Great, who reigned in Damascus about
a century before the Christian era, or by the Romans,
who entered it under the leadership of Pompey, 3.0. 64,

upon one another, that no great difference can be discovered,
or could be expected, between their're5pective styles of archi-
tecture. It cannot be questioned, however, that a heathen
temple once stood on this spot, in which, for several cen—
turies, sacriﬁces were offered to the gods of Pagan mytho-
logy. When the decaying Roman Empire was divided into
two great rival dominions of ‘west and east, and the Power on
the banks of the Tiber was outshone by the Power on the
shores of the BOSphorus, Damascus owned the sway of the
Greek Empire at Constantinople, and, after Constantine had
embraced Christianity, the temple, which had been sacred to
Jupiter, became sacred to Jesus, and was dedicated to John
the Baptist. We know that the Christian faith immediately
after the apostolic age advanced rapidly in Damascus; for
Church history informs us that, at the Council of Nice,
A.D. 325, convened to pronounce an authoritative opinion on
the question of the Divinity of Christ, as raised by the Arian
controversy, its metropolitan bishop attended with seven of
his suﬁragans. Only about ﬁfty years ago, a Greek inscrip—
tion was found on a large stone, at one of the gates, to the
following effect :—“ This church of the blessed John Baptist
