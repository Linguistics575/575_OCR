court conducted to the Sanctuary. To this ediﬁce belonged
the ﬁve splendid pillars which rear to such an astonishing
height an enormous mass of stone, as ﬁnely carved as if
designed for a temple of miniature proportions.

“The peculiar characteristic of this architecture is pre-
cisely this combination of the immense and the graceful, of
Cyclopean vastness with the reﬁned elegance of an art
already in its decadence, but still in possession of most mar-
vellous processes. Nowhere is the Corinthian acanthus
carved with more delicacy than on these gigantic blocks.

“ After studying these three temples in detail, the mind
must be abandoned freely to the impression produced by the
magniﬁcent whole. The fallen fragments heaped on the
ground are as wonderful as the standing remains. '

“ While the ﬁve pillars of the cello of the Great Temple
rear themselves grandly to the eye, the earth around the
foot of the isolated columns still standing, is strewed with
enormous débris, which form a magniﬁcent pell-mell, dis-
playing all imaginable forms of Grecian architecture. It is
the ruin of an entire city, the ideal ruin of a dream, full of
disorder, poetry, grandeur.

“ This is the sublime cenotaph of two distinct, but blended
civilizations; the old natural religions, which so long held
Asia captive, mingle the wrecks of their colossal architecture
with the exquisite forms that the genius of Greece threw off
as if in Sport.

“ Spring casts the garland of her perpetual youth over this
thrice dead past—a smiling irony; camels and sheep graze
on the grass which grows over columns and capitals.
Picture the white chain of Libanus looking down on this
overthrown city; embrace in one comprehensive glance of
thought all the contrasts blended here, and the thrilling effect
of such a scene will be understood.”
