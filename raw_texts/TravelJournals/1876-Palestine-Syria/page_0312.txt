292 . NAZARETH TO TIBERIAS.

who has visited the Holy Land, by some in terms of ex-
travagant praise, and by others in equally extravagant terms
of depreciation. It has been afﬁrmed that there is nothing
but a dreary and desolate waste of barren mountains to be
seen; and it has also been afﬁrmed that Scotland has not a
scene so fair to arrest attention. Each traveller will, of
course, draw his own conclusions. The principal features in
the view are such as to make it impossible that it shall alto-
gether disappoint.

In the foreground are the steeply sloping and well clothed
banks leading down to the lake, which lies as in a basin 3
thousand feet or more below. The whole of the lake, from
Tiberias on the right away to Capernaum on the left, is dis-
tinctly seen. Across the lake, rise the irregular hills, sloping
down more or less precipitously to the water’s edge; they
are bare and barren, it is true, but they are rich and varied in
tone and tint. Behind them are the mountains of Galilee,
and away to the north Hermon rises, and, always magniﬁ-
cent, looks from here more magniﬁcent than ever. Thus the
view consists of verdant slopes, a deep blue lake of consider-
able extent, with hills rising from it, looking like the heathery
hills of Scotland—esPecially in the evening light—and a
snow-clad range of mountains. It is impossible, however, to
separate from these matter-of-fact details the spirit and inspi-
ration of the scene; for yonder, was the dwelling-place of
Christ. Upon those waters He trod, those waves listened to
His voice, and obeyed ; over there, on the left, He preached
the Sermon on the Mount; from one of those plateaus above
the rugged hills the swine fell into the lake. Every place the
eye rests upon is holy ground, for it is associated with some
most sacred‘ scenes in the life of the Master; everywhere
the gosPel is written upon this divinely illuminated page of
Nature, and the very air seems full of the echo of His words.
