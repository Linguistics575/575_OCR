THE TOMB or DAVID. 147

penetrated to a large hall supported by pillars of marble,
encrusted with gold and silver, before which stood a table
with a golden sceptre and crown. This was the sepulchre
of David, King of :Israel, to the left of which they saw that
of Solomon, and of all the Kings of Judah who were buried
there. They further saw locked chests, and desired to enter
the hall to examine them, but a blast of wind, like a storm,
issued forth from the mouth of the cavern, and prostrated
them almost lifeless upon the ground. They lay in this
state until evening, when they heard a voice commanding
them to rise and go forth from'the place. They proceeded,
terror-stricken, to the Patriarch, and informed him of what
had occurred. He summoned Rabbi Abraham el-Constan-
tine, a pious ascetic, one of the. mourners of the downfall of
Jerusalem, and caused the two labourers to repeat the
occurrence in his presence. Rabbi Abraham hereupon in-
formed the Patriarch that they had discovered the sepulchres
of the House of David, and of the Kings of Judah. The
Patriarch ordered the place to be walled up, so as to hide it
effectually from every one, to the present day.”

That is one version of the story, and here is another.
“ The so-called Tomb of David was originally a convent of
Franciscan monks, who believed it to be the site of the
Coenaculum, and their tradition mentions nothing of an
underground cavern, such as is now said by the Maho-
medans to exist. The tradition which makes it the Tomb of
David is purely Muslim in its origin, and does not date
back earlier than the time of El Melik ed Dha’her Chakmak,
14.4.8. Oral tradition in Jerusalem says that a beggar came
one day to the door of the monastery asking for relief, and,
in revenge for being refused went about declaring it was the
Tomb of David, in order to excite the Muslim fanatics to
seize upon and conﬁscate the spot.”
