THE WAlLlNG PLACE. 153

book in hand, the body waving to and fro, the lips muttering
and wailing out lamentation after lamentation.” It is a libel to
call this scene a “ show prepared for the beneﬁt of visitors.”
Jerome makes an aﬁecting allusion to the remnant of‘
mourners in his day who paid the Roman soldiers for allow-
ing them to go and weep over the ruins of the Holy City,
and they were not less sincere then than those who weep
now over their “ holy and beautiful house” deﬁled by inﬁdels.

There is a very beautiful litany sometimes chanted here,
a fragment of which is as follows :—

FIRST CHOIR.

Reader. Because of the palace which is deserted-—
People: We sit alone and weep.
Reader. Because of the Temple which is destroyed,
Because of the walls which are broken down,
Because of our greatness which is departed,
Because of the precious stones of the Temple ground to
powder,
Because of our priests who have erred and gone astray,
Because of our kings who have contemned God—
People. We sit alone and weep.

ANOTHER CHOIR.

Reader. We beseech Thee, have mercy on Zion !

People. And gather together the Children of Jerusalem.
Reader. Make speed, make speed, 0 deliverer of Zion.
People. Speak after the heart of Jerusalem.

Reader. Let Zion be girded with beauty and with majesty.
People. Show favour unto Jerusalem.

Reader. Let Zion ﬁnd again her kings.

People. Comfort those who mourn over Jerusalem.
Reader. Let peace and joy return to Jerusalem.

People. Let the branch of Jerusalem put forth and bud.
