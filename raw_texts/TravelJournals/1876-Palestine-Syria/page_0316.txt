296 SEA or GALILEE.

north into a series of little bays of exquisite beauty—nowhere
more beautiful than at Gennesaret, where the beaches,
pearly white with myriads of minute shells, are on one side
washed by the limpid waters of the lake, and on the other
shut in by a fringe of oleanders, rich in May with their
‘ blossoms red and bright.’

“ The lake is pear-shaped, the broad end being towards the
north; the greatest width is six and three-quarter miles from
Mejdel—‘ Magdala ’-—- to Khersa — ‘ Gergesa ’— about one-
third of the way down ; and the extreme length is twelve and
a quarter miles. The Jordan enters at the north, a swift,
muddy stream, colouring the lake a good mile from its
mouth, and passes out pure and bright at the south. On the
north-western shore of the lake is a plain, two and a half
miles long and one mile broad, called by the Bedouins Et
Ghuweir, but better known by its familiar name of Genne-
sareth ; and on the north-east, near Jordan's mouth, is a
swampy plain, El Batihah, now much frequented by wild
boars—formerly the scene of a skirmish between the Jews-
and Romans, in which Josephus met with an accident that
necessitated his removal to Capernaum. On the west there
is a recess in the hills, containing the town of Tiberias;
and in the east, at the mouths of Wadies Semakh and Fik,
are small tracts of level ground. On the south, the ﬁne open
Valley of the Jordan stretches away towards the Dead Sea,
and is covered in the neighbourhood of the lake with luxu-
riant grass.”——-—(Capt. Wilson, Recovery of‘jerusalem, p. 337.)

Most of the hills are rounded, and the prevailing tone is
brown. This tone is monotonous in certain lights, while in
others, such as an hour before sunset, it gives an extremely
picturesqueappearance to the whole region.

The. Lake of Galilee is from 600 to 700 feet below the
Mediterranean, but the level varies with the seasons. The
