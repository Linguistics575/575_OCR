244 JERUSALEM TO SAMARIA.

On a piece of high ground are the remains of a church.
Tradition has ﬁxed on El-Bireh as the place where the Holy
Family stopped at the close of the ﬁrst day after leaving
Jerusalem, and turned back to the city, when they discovered

value can be attached to the tradition, although it is interest-

The journey from El-B’ireh to Bethel occupies only about
half an hour, and the principal things'to be noted on the way

are a reservoir in a cavern, and a fountain, ’Ain-el-Akabah.

walls of a church.
