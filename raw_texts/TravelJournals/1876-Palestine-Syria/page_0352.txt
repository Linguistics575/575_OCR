[The Hotel Demetri—named after Demetri, the landlord
—is a thoroughly Oriental house. Entering from the
street, which is close to the place where the French
diligence starts for Beyrout, the traveller ﬁnds himself
in a large marble-paved court, surrounded with galleries,
open or latticed. In the centre of the court is a large
tank, or fountain, giving a cool and comfortable air, and
refreshing by its plashing water. Around are citron,
lemon, and orange trees in fruit and ﬂower, sending
forth a delicious perfume. In a recess on the right is a
most luxurious Divan, with couches and easy-chairs,
and a table, well supplied with English, American, and
French newspapers. Here in the evening merchants
come to exhibit Specimens of Damascene manufacture,
and to solicit purchases.

Travellers under the arrangements of Messrs. Coox
and SON always stay at this Hotel now, it having been
found that the camping-place outside the town was not
only inconvenient, but often damp.]

The Ottoman Bank has a branch in Damascus.

There are three or four European Physicians in
Damascus, and several Chemists. (Inquire in the Derb-
el-Mustakim.) ‘

i The English Consulate is near Demetri’s Hotel.
