KIRJATH-JEARIM. 87

“ Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah :
We found it in the ﬁelds of the wood.‘
We will go into His tabernacles :
We will worship at His footstool.
Arise, O Lord, into Thy rest ;
Thou, and the ark of Thy strength. ”
Ps. cxxxii. 6, 8.

The principal thing to see here is a ruined Church,
sometimes called the Church of St. Jeremiah, on the suppo-

where the prophet was born. The church is massive, con-

Traces of frescoes may still be seen on the walls.

It sometimes happens that a party of tourists enter the
church on horseback (it is only used as a stable), and the
effect of a large party in such place and circumstance is
very curious. '

There is a crypt under the church, but it is not accessible.
The church is in possession of the Latins. Few will care
to visit the tomb of Abou-Gosch, which is north of the
church, beside a small mosque.

Descending from Kirjath-jearim (Kuryet-el-‘Enab, or
Abou-Gosch, whichever name may be preferred), in a quar-
ter of an hour we pass on the right an Arab coffee-shop,
beside a spring, named ’Ain Dilb. About here may be seen
several karoob trees (the Ceratonia siliqua of botanists),
which bear pods with a kind of bean in them, very sweet
when ripe. The prodigal son “ would fain have ﬁlled his
belly " with these husks or beans (Luke xv. 16).

To the right of ’Ain Dilb is a high hill with the village
of Séba, and a ruined castle on the top, not satisfactorily
identiﬁed with any scriptural site. In three-quarters of an
