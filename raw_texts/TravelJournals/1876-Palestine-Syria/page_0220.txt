200 THE FRANK MOUNTAIN.

that the Cave of Adullam is not the cave which has been
marked out by tradition, but that the true site is at Ed-el—
Miyé. From the consonantal similarity of the names, and
from the legendary and topographical evidence brought for-

The traveller will now go back to the Wady Urtas, and
crossing it, ascend for about thirty minutes a road to the
right which will bring him to the Frank Mountain, or
Jebel Fureidis (Hill of Paradise). It is a cone, about four
hundred feet in height, and has all the appearance of having
been built by the hand of man; the summit is circular, and
has upon it a few ruins, only part of the walls of the castle

eighty stadia (ten miles), in other respects the particulars
are in exact agreement. He Speaks of the castle being
reached by two hundred steps, of the mound being artiﬁcial,
of the aqueduct, traces of which may still be seen, and its
enormous cost. It was here, therefore, that Herod was buried,
his body having been brought hither from Jericho. The
