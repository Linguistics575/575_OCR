334 DAMASCUS.

Its fame begins with the earliest patriarchs, and continues to
modern times. While other cities of the East have risen
and decayed, Damascus is still what it was. It was founded
before Ba’albek and Palmyra, and it has outlived them both.
While Babylon is a heap in the desert, and Tyre a ruin on
the shore, it remains what it is called in the prophecies of
Isaiah—“ the head of Syria ” (Isaiah vii. 8). Abraham’s
steward was “ Eliezer of Damascus ” (Gen. xv. 2), and the
limit of his warlike expedition in the rescue of Lot was
“Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus” (Gen.
xiv. I 5).

How important a place it was in the ﬂourishing period of
the Jewish monarchy, we know from the garrisons which
David placed there (2 Sam. viii. 6; I Chron. xviii. 6), and
from the Opposition it presented to Solomon (1 Kings xi. 24).
The history of N aaman and the Hebrew captive, Elisha and
Gehazi, and of the proud preference of its fresh rivers to the

close its relations continued to be with the Jews we know
from the chronicles of Jeroboam and Ahaz, and the prophecies
of Isaiah and Amos (see 2 Kings xiv. 28, xvi. 9, IO ; 2 Chron.
xxiv. 23, xxviii. 5—23.; Isaiah vii. 8; Amos i. 34—5).

Its mercantile greatness is indicated by Ezekiel in the
remarkable words addressed to Tyre. (The port of Beyrout
is now to Damascus what Tyre was of old.) “Syria was
thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy
making; they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds, purple,
and broidered work, and ﬁne linen, and coral, and agate.
Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares
of thy making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of
Helbon, and white wool ” (Ezek. xxvii. I6, 18). Leaving
the Jewish annals, we might follow its history through con- ,
tinuous centuries, from the time. when Alexander sent
