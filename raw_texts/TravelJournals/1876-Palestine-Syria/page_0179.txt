STATIONS OF THE CROSS. 159

right, the Church of the Sisters of Zion—ﬁrst by an iron
gate, and then by a wooden door. By turning to the right,
we see, behind a very neat little altar, a part of the Ecce
Homo Arch. Here we undoubtedly see some of the
natural rock; and it has been ascertained that vast rocky
vaults are below. The arch is said to have been connected
with the Judgment Hall. “ Then came Jesus forth, wearing
the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate saith
unto them, Behold the man” (John xix. 5). Descending
now into a street running north and south, and turning to
the left, is—( 3.) The place where Christ sunk under the.
cross. Pilgrims are not agreed as to this Station. The
columns in the corner are said by some to mark the spot
where they compelled one Simon, a Cyrenian, to carry the
cross (Mark xv; 21). Turning south to where another
street joins, We bend sharply to the right, and in the corner
of the wall, to the left, see an indented stone, marking—
(4.) The Impression of Christ’s Shoulder, as He leant
there for support. Afew steps west, on the left,"is—(5.) The
House Of St. Veronica, who wiped the brow of our
Saviour, and His features became imprinted upon her hand-
kerchief. On the left is the Russian Hospital, said to be
over—(7.) The spot where Jesus said, “ Daughters of Jerusa-
lem, weep not for Me, but for yourselves and your children”
(Luke xxiii. 28). From here we follow up the street to
where a minaret stands on the left, and by turning into a
narrow lane on the right, a few steps brings us to one of
the stones that would have cried out if the pe0ple had held
their peace! A few paces west of the minaret a street comes
in on the left, which we follow to where it is spanned by an
arch. Here, in the wall to the left, was the old entrance to
the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Here ends the Via
Dolorosa. The remainder of the street is Christian Street 3
