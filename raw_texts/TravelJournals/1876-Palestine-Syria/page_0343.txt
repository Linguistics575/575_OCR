on the mountain side, with ravines on either side, and
everywhere sparkling streams of water and therefore luxu-
riant vegetation. The modern Village has about ﬁfty or
sixty houses, and one or two shops. There is a rough bridge
over the Jordan made of antique pillars minus the capitals;
parts of the old citadel are still to be seen, and its massive
walls and towers can be traced. In several of the houses old
pillars are built up into the modern dwellings, notably in that
of the Sheikh of the village. It will be observed that on the
roof of nearly every house there is a booth made of green
branches, and raised upon stout pedestals of wood. This is
' the summer sleeping-place, and is designed for the inhabi-
tants to be raised above the swarming scorpions, lizards, and
vermin. .

ruins, esPecially from the bridge and the citadel. These
will not attract the interest of the visitor, who will at once
proceed to the Spot where all the present interest in BAnias
centres. It is the fountain or source of the Jordan, which
bursts out in a series of many streams, and forming a large
basin, ﬂows hence in one copious stream. Behind it rises a
precipitous red limestone cliﬂ“, in the face of which is a cave,
or grotto, the Paneum, or Sanctuary of Pan, from which the
town took its name. On the face of the rock will be seen
niches, with inscriptions which tell of the purpose for which
this grotto was used. On the summit - of the cliff Herod
erected a white marble temple; now there is a wely in
honour of St. George on the same spot. A ﬁne view of
Béniés and its surroundings may be obtained here, when it
will be seen how extensive the ruins are, which cannot be so
well appreciated when the traveller is actually amongst
them. .
