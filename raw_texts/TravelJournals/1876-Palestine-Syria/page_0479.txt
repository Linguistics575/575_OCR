JABESH GILEAD. 459

Extended Tour in Moab.
For Itinerary, see p. 26.

Instead of returning from Jerash (or Gerasa, p. 4 5 5) to
Es-Salt and Jericho, the traveller may proceed northward
to the Lake of Gennesaret.

The ﬁrst stage is from Jerash to Wady Yabis, a ride
through varied and beautiful scenery of hills and dales, and
woods and pastures. The route is by Sdf; with some broken
columns and sepulchral caves. Two or three milestones are
seen belonging to the ancient Roman road from Pella to
Gerasa. Crossing a ridge and threading a narrow valley in
sight of the Kul’at-er-Rubud, fennel», and ’Ajlun are succes-
sively reached. From the latter place the adjacent mountain
range and the surrounding province are named.

It is worth while tomake a détour to the old Saracenic
Kul’aLer-Rubud, (“ Castle of Rubud ”). It is a characteristic
ediﬁce, and commands a Splendid view of the valley of the
Jordan from the Dead Sea to the Lake of Gennesaret.
Beyond the valley are seen Hermon, Lebanon, the hills of
Galilee, Tabor, the Plain of Esdraelon, and the mountains of
Southern Palestine.

In the Wady deis, on its southern bank, are some ruins
considered to represent Jabesh Gilead, whose inhabitants
were visited with swift retribution for not joining in the war
against the Benjamites (Judges xxi. 8). It was the inhabi-
tants of Jabesh Gilead who were thanked by David for re-
moving the bones of Saul and Jonathan from the battleﬁeld
of Gilboa. Saul had previously aided the city in time of
extremity when Nahash, King of the Amorites, was about
to mutilate the inhabitants.

From Wady Yﬁbis. is a two hours’ journey to Pella,
captured by Antiochus the Great in 218 3.0., afterwards
