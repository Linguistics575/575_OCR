From the mound adjoining it, there is a celebrated view.
Nearthe closed gate, Bab Kisﬁn—it has been closed for
700 years—tradition states that St. Paul was let down
through the window in a basket and escaped (p. 337) 3 and
near here is a tomb under some trees, said to be the tomb
of a Saint George, who assisted St. Paul to escape, and
perished in consequence. The Latins look upon this as
the scene of St. Paul’s conversion. Half a mile east of the
