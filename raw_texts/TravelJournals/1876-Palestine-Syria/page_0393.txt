LEBANON AND THE CEDARS. 373

BA’ALBEK TO BEYROUT.
(By the Cedars and Tripoli.)

The Cedars of Lebanon are best visited from Ba’albek
and ’Ain ’Ata. If the traveller intends only to visit the
Cedars, and back to Ba’albek, the following plan is recom-
mended. Ba'albek to ’Ain ’Ata six hours, ’Ain ’Ata to the
Cedars, four hours; back to 'Ain ’Ata, four hours; camp
there, and return when inclined. If travellers continue from
the Cedars direct to Beyrout, they should camp at E1 Husn,
where there is a deep gorge, which takes two. hours to
descend, and two more to ascend; then next day to ’Arka,
from whence an excursion may be made to the Natural
Bridge, and then continue to the Dog River (p. 372), and
thence to Beyrout (p. 367). From the Cedars to Tripoli is
only a day’s ride; from Tripoli to Beyrout is two days by
road, but only three hours by steamer.

The Cedars can be reached via Shtora (p. 3 56) or Zahleh
(p. 366). The road crosses the plain of Bukﬁ’a, and when
a column is passed on the left, an hour further on brings us
to the Spur of the mountain. In half an hour we reach
Deir el-Ahmar, where a guide should be taken. Here the
ascent, ridge over ridge, is made, until the traveller arrives
at the little village of ’Ain ’Ata, inhabited by Maronites.
From here the ascent is steep until the summit is reached.
The view from this elevation is as extensive as it is beautiful,
commanding all the ridges of the mountain, and below the
great plain of Buké’a on one side, and the white houses of
Tripoli on the other. The celebrated Cedars are reached
by a descent of about an hour.
