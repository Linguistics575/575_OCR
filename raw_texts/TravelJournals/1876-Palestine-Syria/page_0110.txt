whole movement. ‘ Slack not thy hand from thy servants ;
come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us 3 for all the
kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered
together against us.’ Not a moment was to be lost, As
in the battle of Marathon, everything depended on the sud-
denness of the blow which should break in pieces the hostile
confederation. On the former occasion of Joshua’s visit to
Gibeon it had been a three days’ journey from Gilgal, as
according to the slow pace of Eastern armies and caravans it
might well be. But now, by a forced march, ‘Joshua came
upon them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all night.’
When the sun rose behind him he was already in the open
ground at the foot of the heights of Gibeon, where the kings
were encamped (according to tradition) by a spring in the
neighbourhood. The towering hill, at the foot of which
Gibeon lay, rose before them on the west. The besieged
and the besiegers were alike taken by surprise. As often
before and after, so now, ‘ not a man could stand before ’ the
awe and the panic of the sudden sound of that terrible shout
—the sudden appearance of that undaunted host, who came
with the assurance not ‘ to fear, nor tobe dismayed, but to be
strong and of a good courage, for the Lord had delivered their
enemies into their hands.’

“ The Canaanites ﬂed down the western pass, and ‘ the
Lord discomﬁted them before Israel, and slew them
with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them
along the way that goeth up to Beth-Horon.’ This was the
ﬁrst stage of the ﬂight. It is a long rocky ascent, sink-
ing and rising more than once before the summit is
reached. From the summit, which is crowned by the village
of Upper Beth-Horon, a wide view opens over theivalley of
Ajalon, of ‘ Stags ’ or ‘ Gazelles,’ which runs in from the
plain of Sharon. Jaﬁ'a, Ramleh, Lydda are all visible beyond.
