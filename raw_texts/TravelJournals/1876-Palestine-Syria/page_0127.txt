who headed the third Crusade, were unable to retake the
city, though they appointed nominal kings over it. The last
of them, John de Brienne, obtained the aid of his son-in-law,
Frederick II. of Germany, against the Muslims. The city
was yielded to the Emperor, through a treaty with the Sultan
Meledin of Egypt, in the year 12.29, on condition that the
walls should not be rebuilt, but the Christians disregarded
this stipulation. '

In 1239 Jerusalem again fell under Mahomedan rule,
being taken by the Sultan of Damascus; but four years later
his successor yielded it to the Christians, with other cities,
to purchase their assistance in a war which he was meditating
against the Sultan of Egypt. In the year 1244., a Tartar
horde, the Kharezmians, took it by storm, and treated the
inhabitants with great cruelty. Shortly afterwards they
were dispersed by the Mahomedans of Syria, and it has
been a Muslim city ever since that time. In the year 1517,
the place was taken, with the rest of Syria and Egypt, by the
Ottoman Sultan Selim I., and in 1542. its present walls were
built by Soliman the Magniﬁcent. Napoleon planned the
siege of the city in the year 1800, but gave up the idea. In
consequence of a revolt, induced by over-taxation, it was
bombarded by the Turks in 1825. In 1831 it submitted to
the Pasha of Egypt, Mahomed Ali, but by European
interference he was deprived of his possessions in Syria, and
in 1840 Jerusalem agained owned the Turkish sway, under
the Sultan Abdul Mejid.—F. H.

It may assist the traveller to give an account of the city as
it appeared in the time of our Lord, and to refresh his memory
with the story of the Fall of Jerusalem, and we do so in the
graphic words of the late Archbish0p of Canterbury.
