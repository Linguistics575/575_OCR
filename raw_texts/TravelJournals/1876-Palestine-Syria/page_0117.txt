NEBY SAMWIL. . . 99

many places Which a dragoman will point out, such as
Azotus (Ashdod), whither Philip was conveyed by the
Spirit; Ekron, where the ark abode; Yélo, the ancient
Ajalon; and numerous other places of more or less interest.

N eby Samwil, the Mizpeh of the Old Testament, was
a city in Benjamin (Joshua xviii. 2.6), and here the great
national assemblies of Israel were held in the time of the
Judges. “ Then all the children of Israel went out, and
the congregation was gathered together as one man, from
Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the
Lord in Mizpeh ” (Judges xx. 1).

When Samuel mourned over the sins of Israel, he said,
“ Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will. pray for you unto
the Lord. And they gathered together to MizPeh ”
(1 Sam. xii. 5, 6). One of the most remarkable scenes
in Mizpeh was when a young man was brought hither,
and “ when he stood among the people he was higher than
any of the people from his shoulders and upwards . . . and
all the people shouted and said, God save the king ” (1 Sam.
x. 24, 25), and Saul became their king. It was between Miz-
peh and Shenthat “ Samuel tooka stone . . . . and called
the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto :the Lord hath
helped us” (1 Sam. vii. 6—12). The town was fortiﬁed
. by Asa (I:Kings xv. 22). Gedaliah was assassinated here
(é. Kings xxv. 23—25) 5 and when, in the time of Nehemiah,
the wall of Jerusalem was rebuilt, the men of Mizpeh joined
with the men of Gibeon in rebuilding one portion of the
wall (Neh. iii. 7, 15, 19).

The modern village has not anything of great interest
for the traveller. A Mahomedan tradition makes this the
birth-place of Samuel, but there is strong evidence to the
contrary. They also afﬁrm that it is the place of his burial,
and with a good backsheesh they will show his sarcophagus
