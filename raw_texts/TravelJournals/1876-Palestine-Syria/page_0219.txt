THE CAVE OF ADULLAM. 199

some dozens of candles. From this hall several passages
diverge hither and thither. One passage is much longer than
any of the others, and leads into another large cavern, which
can only be reached by jumping or dropping a depth of ten
feet; and from here another passage has to be crawled
through in order to reach the third chamber, which is not
worth the trouble of visiting, as it involves so much dis.-
comfort.

In some of the passages, sarcophagi and funereal
emblems have been found; also inscriptions now illegible.
The principal thing for visitors to see is the great cave, as
here according to tradition, David took refuge. David

that was in debt, and every one that was discontented,
gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain
over them: and there were with him about four hundred
men ” (I Sam. xxii. I, 2).

to Bethlehem to satisfy the desire of their chief, when he
cried, “ Oh, that one would give me drink of the water of
the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate! ” (2 Sam. xxiii.
15—17) (p. 196). And it was from here that he went to plead
with the King of Moab for protection for his parents, and
afterwards took them from the cave through these winding
glens, crossed the Jordan with them, and left them under.
the protection of the king. “And they dwelt with him all
the while that David was in the hold ” (I Sam. xxii. 4.).
