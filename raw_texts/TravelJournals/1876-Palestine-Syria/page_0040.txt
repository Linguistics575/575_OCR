22 ‘ INTRODUCTORY.

SEVENTH ITINERARY.

THE BEATEN TRACK or A THIRTY DAYs’ TOUR IN
PALESTINE.

In the late autumn it is better to travel from north to south,
thus going with the season. In the spring the contrary way is
preferable, as the route by Lebanon and Mount Hermon is
frequently snowed up in the early part of the year.

Seven travelling days are shown in the Fifth Itinerary to
Jenin, and from that point travel on the

8TH DAY.—-To Nazareth, crossing the Plain of Esdraelon
by Jezreel, Gideon’s Fountain, Shunem, leaving to the right,
N ain, Endor, Mount Tabor, etc., and going by Shunem, across
the plain to the foot of the Galilean Hills, the ascent of which
to Nazareth requires great care, it being very precipitous, and
moderate riders must not expect to accomplish the journey from
Jenin to Nazareth in less than seven to eight hours. Again we
advise the spending of Sunday at this place of sacred memories.

9TH DAY.-—The journey from Nazareth to the Sea of
Galilee, by Kefr Kenna, or Cana, occupies about six hours in
the saddle, or more if the camp is stationed at the head of the
lake. If possible two days should be appropriated to this
locality, so rich as it is in historical reminiscences, in addition
to its pleasant natural attractions.

IOTH DAY.———Two ways present themselves from the head
of the lake—the site of the ancient Chorazin and Capernaum,
to Banias—Casarea Philippi. The way by the waters of Merom
occupies two days, and that by Safed and Kedesh-Naphtali takes
three days. The latter is the more interesting, and is free from
the swamps and damp of the lower road. The choice of these
two ways is generally left to the travellers who may be guided
by the state of the weather and the time at their disposal.
Assuming that the high road is preferred, three days will be
consumed between the Sea of Galilee and B5niﬁs, and to that
section of the Itinerary we allot the

1 ITH, 12TH, and I 3TH DAYS of travel, arriving at Banias on
