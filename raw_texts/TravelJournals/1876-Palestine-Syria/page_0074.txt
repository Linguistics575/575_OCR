56 _ PALESTINE EXPLORATIONS.

.Tristram, Porter, Burton, Bonar, and a host of others less
generally known, but in their Sphere enterprising and useful,
to carry on the work.

Some ten years ago a number of gentlemen interested in
Biblical research met together to compare notes as to their
knowledge of the Holy Land. It was found that the amount
of available information as to this country was amazingly
small. From that meeting originated the Society known as
The Palestine ExploratiOn Fund.

To the explorations in Jerusalem reference has been
made elsewhere (p. 114.). The more recent labours of the
agents of the Society have been directed to the carryingon of
a trigonometrical survey of the whole country. Of this
work 4430 square miles are completed, and it is now
promised that “ a complete and exhaustive map of the whole
of Western Palestine—including, that is, nine-tenths of the
scenes of the Bible narrative—will be brought to England
in the autumn of 1876, and given to the world a year later."
Meanwhile, Moab and the country east of the Jordan are
being surveyed by an American Association.

But whilst an accurate survey of the surface of the ground
and the correct location on the map of existing towns and
villages is at present the main object of the Society, its agents
have used the opportunities afforded by their labour for the
identiﬁcation of sites rendered memorable by sacred narrative.
Among the more important identiﬁcations of the past year,
we may mention Gezer, the Hall of Hachilah, the Rock of
Maon, Zanoah, Arab, Maarath, Chozeba, Beth Zetho, the
Levitical City of Debir, the City and Cave of Adullam, the
Tower of Ader, the Forest of Hareth, the Wood of Ziph, the
Altar of Ed, the Ford of Bethabara, etc.
