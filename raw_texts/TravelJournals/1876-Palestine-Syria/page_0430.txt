have had ideas of sanctity connected with it, but it is of
course in connection with the Prophets Elijah and Elisha
that it attained to its chief celebrity. In early Christian
times, numberless hermits took up their abode in caves
and solitary cells on and about this mountain. Subsequently,
a monastery arose here, and became of considerable repu-
tation. When Napoleon was besieging Acre, this monastery
was utilized as an hospital for the wounded. When the
French retreated the building was destroyed by the Pasha.
Some time after, a monk named Jean Battista, who had
taken vows as an act of penance, came on pilgrimage to
Carmel, and found only an altar and an archway. He vowed
to rebuild the Convent, travelled and begged for fourteen
years, and the present ediﬁce is the result of his labours.

The Convent is said to be erected over the cave in which
Elijah sought shelter when Ahab was seeking his life. At
a little distance down the mountain side is a ,larger cave,
called the “Cave of the Prophets,” alleged to be the one
alluded to by Obadiah, when he said to Elijah, “Was it not
told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the Prophets of
the Lord, how I hid an hundred men of the Lord’s prophets
by ﬁfty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water ? "

The opening to the ﬁrst of these caves is under the high
~altar in the church. The monks assert that there has been
a continuity of religious guardians to this mountain since
the time of Elijah—that the sons of the prophets dwelt
there until the time of Our Saviour, and then embraced
Christianity. Certainly the sanctuary here is mentioned by
classical writers—both Pythagoras and Tacitus visited it.
In the church the visitor will observe a modern monument,
erected to commemorate the burial here, in 1864, of Edward
Henry Etienne, Prince de Craon.
