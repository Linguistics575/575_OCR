from the graves. and drank it as an act of pious homage to
the dead."——(Hac/cett.)

There is an interesting ruined synagogue here; the
outline of the facade can be traced, and one of the walls is
comparatively perfect. The door-posts consist of single
blocks of stone, nearly ten feet high. A rocky precipice, cut
down apparently to some extent for the purpose, formed one
side of the building.

Many traditions, mostly worthless, cluster round this
neighbourhood. A spring is called Deborah’s Fountain,
because she bathed here on the morning of the murder of
Sisera. A stone pillar, on which Elijah sat, and will sit when
he comes again, etc., etc.

Kefr Birinl is two hours further on in a north-westerly
direction. It is occupied entirely by Maronites. It was
once a celebrated Jewish pilgrimage-place, and was said to
be the burial-place of Barak, Obadiah, Queen Esther, and
others. There are ruins of a synagogue and other buildings
here, but the place is really only interesting to Jews, or those
who take a special interest in all that concerns the Jews.
The town does not claim even to have a mention in the Old
Testament.

TIBERIAS To BANIAS
(By Safed.)

From Tiberias to Tell-Hum (p. 298).

From Tell-Hum to Safed (p. 310).

The journey from Safed to Banias may be accomplished
in about nine hours. There are two ways by which it may
be performed, either by joining the main route from Khﬁn
Yubb Yﬁsef to ’Aiu Melléha (p. 317), or by way of Kedesh-
N aphtali and Hunin. Both routes are interesting, but many
travellers give the preference to the latter.
