hewn in the rocks. Near here, as the name indicates,
must have stood that Tower of Siloam, of which we
read that it “ fell, and slew eighteen persons " (Luke xiii. 4).
At the base of Ophel, where it rises to the height of forty or
ﬁfty feet, in a slight channel cut in the rocky bottom for the
purpose, runs the rill described by Milton as,

“ Siloah’s brook that ﬂowed
Fast by the oracle of God ;"

identical with the rill described by Isaiah (viii. 6), “The
waters of Siloah, that go softly.” Following the stream
north-west, the Pool of Siloam is reached. It is 53 feet
long, 18 feet broad, and 19 feet deep. Some broken columns
and other fragments show that an ediﬁce—probably a church
—--was formerly built over the pool. It was to this place that
the blind man was sent by the Saviour, “He anointed the
eyes of the blind man with clay, and said unto him, Go,
wash in the pool of Siloam ; ‘he went his way and washed,
and came seeing” (John ix. 6, 7). Here, no doubt, was
the “ King’s Garden," of which Nehemiah speaks as “near
the pool of Siloah” (iii. I 5). Josephus makes frequent
reference to this place: “Now, the valley of the Cheese-
mongers, as it was called, and that which we told you before.
distinguished the hill of the upper city from that of the
lower, extended as far as Siloam 5 for that is the name of a
fountain which hath sweet water in it.”—-(Whrs, Book I.
chap. vi. 1). .

The Fountain of the Virgin, on the left, is an arti-
ﬁcial pool cut into the side of Ophel, as the projecting part
of Moriah is named. Two ﬂights of steps—the ﬁrst sixteen,
the second thirteen, with a plane of twelve feet between
them, lead down to the water.’ The basin is eleven and a
half feet long, and eleven feet wide. Robinson and Tobler
