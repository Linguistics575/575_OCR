JAFFA TO ASCALON AND GAZA.

I. This journey may be performed by keeping to the
jerusalem route as far as Ramleh (p. 74), and then striking

also, Zech. ix. 5—7. ‘

the sand hills that fringe the Mediterranean coast in this part,
and across the Wady Surﬁr, which is a river in the winter
season. The ﬁrst part of this ride, as soon as the gardens of
