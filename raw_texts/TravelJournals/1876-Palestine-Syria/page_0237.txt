NEBY MﬁSA. 9J7

three-quarters of a mile, then turning to the right, we cross
the Kidron. Before us is a long and tedious ascent, but
when the top is reached, a ﬁne view bursts upon the sight-—
the vast wilderness of Engedi. Then a long descent, and,
after crossing the valley, we enter a narrow ravine called
Wady-el-Nar (Valley of Fire).

Soon after leaving the ravine, while winding round the
northern end of a mountain named El-Runeiterrah, a heap
of small stones will be seen directing the attention of pil-
grims to the Minaret of Neby Mﬁsa (Tomb of Moses):
which can be seen about a mile and a half to the left. Here
Muslim tradition has transferred the grand story of Holy
Writ, which distinctly states that Moses was buried “in a
valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor, but no
manknoweth of his sepulchre unto this day ” (Deut. xxxiv.
6). As there is not the slightest authenticity or reason in
the legend, few travellers will care to make a détour to visit
the tomb, although it is the Spot which thousands of Muslim
pilgrims visit annually. A few minutes from here, and one
of the grandest Views in all Palestine comes in sight.
Before us is the great chain of the mountains of Moab, like
a huge blue wall ; beneath it is that “great and melancholy
marvel,” the Dead Sea 5 at our feet stretches the Valley of
the Jordan, the long line of dark foliage running through it
marking the course of the river; away in the distance,
Mount Hermon, a hundred miles off, can be seen distinctly
when the air is clear. A hundred notable sights can be indi-
cated from this spot. Among them will be pointed out Jebel
Seba (Mount Nebo) (p. 451). “ And Moses went up from
the Plain of Moab unto the Mountain of Nebo, to the top of
Pisgah that is over against Jericho” (Deut. xxxiv. I). The
supposed Peak of Pisgah is a little north of east from the
northern end of the Dead Sea, and Wady Hesbdn (the Val-
