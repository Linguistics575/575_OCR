TANTﬁRA. 407

The Apostle’s next appearance in the city is the fulﬁl-
ment of the prophecy of Agabus. He is brought by “ two
hundred soldiers,” and “ horsemen three-score-and-ten, and
Spearmen two hundred,” and arraigned before Felix, the
Governor (Acts xxiii. 23—35). In chaps. xxiv., xxv., and
xxvi. are detailed those wonderful conferences between the
great Apostle and the highest dignitaries of the province,
during whic , “ as Paul reasoned of righteousness, tem-

this lovely and forsaken shore.

Leaving Kaisariyeh, and proceeding northward, an
aqueduct is seen, a small brook crossed, and the'Castle of
El Melat is seen to the left. The stream is the Nahr Zurka,
and was called by the ancients the Crocodile River.

Here the Plain of Sharon is bounded by some wooded hills,
an offshoot from Carmel. The road runs along the beach
to T antﬁra, passing another stream, called the Nahr Kerajz'.

ruins, the most consPicuous beingnn old tower, thirty feet in
height—a prominent object from any point between Caesarea
and Carmel.
