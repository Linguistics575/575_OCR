BA‘ALBEK. 36 3

Entering the ruins by a breach in. the wall, we ﬁnd our-
selves in a large Court, seventy yards long by about eighty-
ﬁve wide; it is in the form of a hexagon, with here and
there rectangular recesses in the wall, each with columns in
front. A handsome portal led from this hexagon into the
Great Court, about a hundred and ﬁfty yards long by a
hundred and twenty-ﬁve wide, in the centre of which stood
the Basilica, while around were rectangular recesses, called
by the Romans Exedrae. Shell-shaped niches, and others
with remarkably ornate decorations adorned the walls. It
will be observed that the chambers on one side are an exact
repetition of the chambers on the other. It was in front of
this great court that the principal temple of Ba’ albek reared
its head.

The Great Temple is now but a mass of ruins, it
was a peristyle, z..e ., a temple with columns running round

upon as long as he remains here with unwearying delight.
They are about sixty feet in height, with Corinthian capitals,
and bordered with a frieze. The Arabs have ruthlessly
hacked them, for the purpose of securing the iron cramps,
and have done so much damage, that recent visitors, practical
architects, have prOphesied the speedy fall of the last remains
of, perhaps, the ﬁnest temple in the world. Originally
there were seventeen columns on either side of the temple,
and ten at either end, ﬁfty-four in all ; the building enclosed
by them being two hundred and ninety feet long by a
hundred a sixty broad. All around there are masses of
broken columns and débris.

Turning now through a passage on the left, we reach the
Temple of the Sun, which stands on a basement or
platform lower than that of the Great Temple. There is
