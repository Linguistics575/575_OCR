3o GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES.

The Holy Land is now perhaps the most familiar name
of this country. It occurs in Zechariah: “ The Lord shall
inherit Judah his portion in the holy land” (ii. 12). It
was a favourite term with the Jewish Rabbis, and almost
superseded all other names of the country, when, during the
Crusades, all Europe was fevered with excitement about the
sites of Sacred History.

The Holy Land, or Palestine, is bounded on the north by
the mountains of Lebanon, east and south by the Deserts
which separate it from Arabia and Egypt, and west by the
Mediterranean. Its length is about two hundred miles, its
average breadth about sixty miles: its area twelve thousand
square miles. The estimated population of Syria is 2,740,000.

Whilst occupying a very central position, Palestine is thus
a remarkably isolated country. The only direct communi-
cation with what the Rabbis called “ the land out of Israel,”
was with Syria t0 the north, and this only by the narrow
pass of the Valley of Coele Syria. The deserts, the moun-
tains, and the sea were “ the natural fortiﬁcations of that
vineyard which was ‘ hedged round about’ with tower and
trench, sea and desert, against the ‘ boars of the wood ’ and
the ‘ beasts of the ﬁeld.’ ” .

The face of the country has peculiar yet simple features.
Four plainly-marked belts run from north to south; the
Maritime Plain along the sea-coast ; a central belt of moun-
tains; a broad valley through which ﬂows the Jordan; and,
lastly, a belt of table-land east of the last-mentioned river.

The Maritime Plain scarcely exists north of the Ladder of
Tyre (p. 417), or at least is only represented by a narrow slip
about two miles wide, on which, however, once ﬂourished
the great cities of Phoenicia. South of the Ladder of Tyre
the true boundary between Phoenicia and Palestine, the Mari-
time Plain fairly commences. Cornﬁelds and pasture lands
