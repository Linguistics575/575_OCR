NILE TOURS .TO THE FIRST AND SECOND
' CATARAOTS-

For eight years the agency for Nile Tours has been com-
mitted to Messrs. COOK & SON by the Khédive Administration.
During that time constant improvements have been made in
the service; steamers have been ﬁtted with deck saloons and
the sleeping berths greatly improved. The food supplies have
been under their control to a great extent, and will be emphati-
cally so in [the future, as they intend to exercise more rigid
regulations for the interest and comfort Ofvoyagers. Contractors,
dragomans, and servants Of every grade will be most vigilantly
watched and rigidly dealt with if any incivility or inattention is
shown to passengers. The extension Of arrangements for the
Second Cataract will be improved, and no doubt, ere long, a
class of steamers will navigate the Nile that will ensure a large
passenger trafﬁc.

The service Of each season will begin about the second week

in November}! or by the ﬁrst Of December, and NILE TRIPS
MAY PRECEDE 0R FOLLOW TRIPS TO PALESTINE (p. 1), as
most convenient to the travellers who wish to embrace the two
Objects in one visit to the East. The trips to the First Cataract
and back occupy twenty days, and fourteen more are allowed
for trips tO the Second Cataract.

DAHABEAHS can also be secured on the best terms for all
who desire them, and dragomans and Other necessary servants
and food supplies can be arranged by them on the best terms.
