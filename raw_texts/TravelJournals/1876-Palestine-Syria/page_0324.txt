disciples in one of His most touching utterances. Having
elicited from Peter that the tribute should be taken from
strangers, and that the children should go free, he added, “ N ot-

and the farewell meal was Spread, the Lord bade them dine.
And there the disciple who, three times warned, had thrice

and Divine performance—the peaceful scene of the opening
career of the Redeemer, the cradle of His teaching, the
