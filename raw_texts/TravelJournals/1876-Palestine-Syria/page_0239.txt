MOUNT NEBO. 2 I 9 _

But when the warrior dieth,
His comrades in the war,

With arms reversed, and mufﬂed drum,
Follow his funeral car.

Among the noblest of the land
We lay the bard to rest,

And give the sage an honoured place,
With costly marble drest.

In the great minster transept,
Where lights, like glories, fall,

And the organ rings, and the sweet choir sings
Along the emblazoned wall.

I

T his was the greatest warrior
That ever buckled sword—

T/zi: the most gifted poet
That ever breathed a word.

And never earth’s philosopher
Traced with his golden pen

On the deathless page, truths half so sage
As he wrote down for men.

And had he not high honour—P
The hillside for a pall—-—

To lie in state while angels wait,
And stars for tapers tall.

And the dark rock-pines, like tossing plumes,
Over his bier to wave,

And God’s own hand, in that lonely land,
To lay him in the grave.

In that strange grave without a name,
Whence his uncoﬁined clay

Shall break again-oh, wondrous thought !—
Before the judgment day,

And stand with glory wrapt around
On the hills he never trod,

And speak of the strife that won our life
With the incarnate Son of God.
