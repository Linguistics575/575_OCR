 

CHURCH OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE. 123

The history of the church has been so often recorded,
and is such a lengthened story of vicissitudes, that it is out
of the province of this book to enter minutely into it. The
reader is referred to Fergusson’s works, Smith’s Dictionary of
the Bible, Barclay’s City Qf the Great King, Besant and
Palmer's City of Herod and Saladin, etc.

It must be remembered that Fergusson has expounded a
theory that the Sepulchre of Christ is the Dome of the Rock
(p. I 37), a theory which has been amply exploded.

Dean Stanley has an interesting note which may throw
some light on the controversy as to the site of the Se-
pulchre.

Every traveller will ask, “ Is there any good argument in
favour of the Tomb of Christ having ever been within the
site of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre?” Dr. Stanley
says, “ In the topographical question, the opponents of the.
identity of the Sepulchre have never done justice to the argu--

pointedly brought out by Professor Willis, which is derived
from the so-called tombs of Joseph and Nicodemus. Under-
neath the western galleries of the church, behind the Holy
Sepulchre, are two excavations in the face of the rock,
forming an ancient Jewish sepulchre, as clearly as any that
can be seen in the valley of Hinnom, or in the Tombs of the
Kings. That they should have been so long overlooked,
both by the advocates and opponents of the identity of the
Holy Sepulchre, can only be accounted for by the perverse
dulness of the coventual guides of the church, who point the
attention of travellers and pilgrims, not to those sepulchres,
but to two graves sunk into the ﬂoor in front of them, pos-
sibly, however, as Dr. Schulz suggests, dug at a later time to
represent the graves, when the real object of the ancient
sepulchres had ceased to be intelligible; just as the tombs of
