ASCALON. 3 8 7

The subsequent history of Ascalon since the period of
the Old Testament narrative is of great interest. Under the
successors of Alexander, many battles were fought for the
possession of this strong city on the sea-coast. Herod the
Great added to the splendour of Ascalon by building porti-
coes, baths, etc. In the ﬁerce struggle between the Jews
and Romans, terrible scenes were enacted here; on one
occasion, two thousand ﬁve hundred Jews were deliberately
killed in cold blood.

Ascalon was taken by the Crusaders in I 152, ﬁfty years
after the rest of Palestine had yielded. Four months were
occupied in a ﬁerce attack by sea and land. When a breach
was effected in the walls, a band of Templars rushed in and
were killed to a man. At length the town yielded; but its
defenders made their own terms, and marched out with the
honours of war.

In 1187, Saladin regained the town. In 1191, Richard
Cmur de Lion appeared on the stage of events, and after
ﬁghting his way from Acre, defeated the Muslims at Arsoof.
Saladin and his army of thirty thousand men demolished the
city and its immense walls, to prevent its falling into the
hands of the English. It was again partly restored, and
held successively by Templars and Knights of St. John. In
1270, Sultan Bibars completely destroyed the defences of the
town. For about three centuries the place has been utterly
abandoned.

The orchards and gardens alluded to as existing on part
of the site of the city, and also without the walls to the
north-east, are cultivated by the inhabitants of the miserable
little village of El-Jﬁrah, situated in the immediate vicinity
of the ruins.

Ashkelon, Eshkalon, or Askelon, as it is variously called
in the Scriptures, lay away from the great road into Egypt,
