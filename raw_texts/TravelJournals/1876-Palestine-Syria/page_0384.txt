nothing ﬁner in all Syria than this magniﬁcent, and well-
preserved ruin; nineteen, out of the forty-six columns with
which it was formerly adorned, remain, they are each sixty-ﬁve
feet high, including base and capital, and six feet three inches in
diameter. One of 'these columns has fallen against the cella,
in which position it has remained for more than a century;
the capitals and entablatures of the columns, and the friezes
round them are exquisitely executed. ,
Probably the most interesting and beautiful part of the
whole structure is the Portal of the Temple. Incredible
as it may appear, the door-posts are monoliths, ornamented
most richly with foliage and genii. The architrave is of
three stones, and on the lower side is the ﬁgure of the eagle,
the emblem of the sun. The stone in the centre looks dan-
gerous, but has been securely propped up. Beside the portal
there is a spiral staircase, by means of which a possible but
unsafe journey may be made upon the walls. The.cella,
about a hundred feet by seventy, is exceedingly rich in orna-
mentation; eight ﬂuted half-columns are on either side, and
at the west end was the altar of the Christian church. All
the details of this wonderful building deserve minute inspec-
tion. A walk round the Walls should not, on any account
be omitted, as the substructure, with its Cyclopean masonry,
is as wonderful, or more so, than the temple itself. All the
masonry of the outer wall is prodigious in its dimensions;
but the marvel of marvels is the western wall, where are
Three Stones, the largest ever used in architecture. The
temple itself was called Trilithon, or three-stoned, probably
from these stupendous blocks. One stone measures sixty-
four feet long, another sixty-three feet eight inches, and a
third sixty-three feet; each is thirteen feet high and thirteen
feet thick, and they have been placed in the wall at a height
of twenty feet above the ground. How they were ever raised
