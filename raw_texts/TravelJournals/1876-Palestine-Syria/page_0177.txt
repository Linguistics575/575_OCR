OPHEL. _ 1 5 7

from above into the depth, this farther vastly .high elevation
of the Cloister stood upon that height, insomnch that if any
one looked down from the top of the battlements, or down
both those altitudes, he wouldbe giddy, while his sight could
not reach to such an immense depth ” (Antiquities of the
7310.9, B. XV.. c. xi. 3, 5). “ I remember very well,” says
Dr. Stoughton, “ when standing by the south-east angle of
the Haram wall, and admiring the beautiful massive stones,
‘polished after the similitude of a palace,’ that I thought
Josephus had much exaggerated the truth when he spoke of
the height of the building at this point as so immense, that
if any one looked down from the top he would be giddy; yet
this turns out to be literally the truth.”

Another important discovery has been made in connec-
tion with this south-eastern part of the Haram wall. In
2 Chron. xxvii. 3, Jotham is described as having built much
“in the wall of Ophel.” Other references are made to
Ophel as near the Water Gate (Neh. iii. 28), and as the
residence of the Levites (Neh. xi. 2:). Josephus also refers
to Ophla—no doubt, the same place—as near the Kidron
Valley. Ophel, as the name indicates, is a swelling de-
clivity, and slopes off on the southern side of the Haram
down into the Valley of Hinnom, forming a spur or pro-
montory between the Tyropaeon and the Valley of Jehosha-
phat. Here Captain Warren sunk ﬁfty shafts in search of a
wall—such a wall as Jotham is said to have built—and with
complete success. The line of wall is ascertained to extend
southward of the vaults known as Solomon’s Stables (p.
140) to a distance of 700 feet along the eastern ridge of
Ophel. A tower has been discovered at a distance of 76 feet
from the south-east angle. About 200 feet further south it
is believed by Captain Warren, another tower existed. While
its date cannot be exactly determined, it is probable that this
