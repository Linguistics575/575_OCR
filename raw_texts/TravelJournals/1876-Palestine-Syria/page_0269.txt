LEBONAH. 249

cultivated appearance, thus forming a striking contrast to
the site on which Shiloh stands.

' Crossing now the cultivated ﬁelds, we descend to the
Wady-el-Lubban, and by and by reach a fountain of excellent
water, beside the ruined Khan el-Lubbén. This is
supposed to be the ancient Lebonah, and if so it establishes
the position of Shiloh. “Behold there is a feast of the
Lord in Shiloh yearly, which is on the north side of Bethel,
on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel
to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah " (Judges
xxi. 19). Some rock tombs will be found here.

We are now on a much better road, passing the village
of Es-Sc’iwiyeh on the left, and in a few minutes more the
khan of the same name. We rest for a while under a large
oak-tree, and then descend by a rather sharp road to the
Wady Yetma, then up hill' to a bleak plateau, where a
splendid view greets the traveller. Stretched before him is
the great plain, surrounded by the mountains of Samaria.
Before him on the left is Gerizim, and beyond that Ebal, while
far away to the north is'the snow-clad Hermon. Everywhere
there is fertility, and although so many ages have passed
since the dying patriarch gave his blessing on Ephraim,'the
“good things” remain, even to the olive and the corn, the ﬁg
and the vine, the fruitful bough by a well, and blessings
prevailing unto the utmost bounds of the everlasting hills.

Instead of proceeding by the road on the left, which
leads direct to Nabulus, the traveller is advised to take the
road on the right, which leads to jacob’s Well.

_ The plain is beautifully level, and the horses that have
for the past few days been picking their way over stony
places, will probably be as glad as the riders to have a good
canter here, and, as in Palestine the opportunities are so rare,
it is well to make the most of them.
