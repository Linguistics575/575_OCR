THE CRUSADES. 45

of Bagdad till 969, when it fell under the power of the Fati-
mite Caliphs of Egypt. In 1076—7 it was conquered by the
Seljuk Turks, but in 1096 it was regained by the Egyptian '
Sultans, who were in possess-ion of the country when it was
invaded by the Crusaders in the following year.

The Crusades must be treated of very brieﬂy. Peter
the Hermit, moved by the cries of the pilgrims, and the sight
of their sufferings, had ﬁred all Europe with his vehement.
eloquence, and every class and rank seemed only anxious to
rush to Palestine and rescue the Holy Places from the
Inﬁdels. For centuries, Christians had endured the growing
tyranny of Islam, and the moment had come to stay the
barbaric eruption that threatened the civilized world.

Crusade I. (1097, A.n.)——An undisciplined mob,
under Peter the Hermit and other incompetent leaders,
perished on the way to Palestine. Then a grand host under
Godfrey de Bouillon, Robert of Normandy, Boehmond,
Raymond, etc., followed ; took Antioch after a nine-months’
siege, defeated opposing armies, and stormed Jerusalem, July
15th, 1099. Fearful was the carnage. The victors are said to
have boasted that “in the Mosque of Omar, whither they
pursued the fugitives, they rode in the blood of Saracens up
to the knees of their horses.”

Four Christian states were now formed in Palestine.
Godfrey de Bouillon reigned at Jerusalem, and other princes
at Antioch, Edeesa, and Tripoli.

The Christian kingdom of Jerusalem lasted eighty-Seven
years. Many churches and convents, and other buildings
were reared. The Knights Hospitallers and Knights
Templars rose into power.

Crusade II. failed in its objects—the recapture of
Edessa, (which the Saracens had taken,) and the capture of
Damascus.
