“The defenced city shall be desolate . . . there shall
the calf feed " (Isa. xxvii. to). And again, “ the forts and
towers shall be dens for ever . . . a pasture for ﬂocks ”

(Isa. xxxii. 14). The view from this point, including Sal-

thirty other towns is very interesting.

An hour’s journey from Hebrﬁn brings the visitor to El
Kufr. a town whose history and ancient name are alike un-
known. Its massive stone houses, its outer walls, and even
the town gates, each composed of a single stone slab ten
feet in height, are standing; yet the place is tenantless.
One' building with a tower, has at some period been used as

ruins, which are one and a-half miles in circuit. Numerous
deserted towns are seen on the plain, from this point ;
amongst them are Tell Ski-cg“, Mc‘ilz‘ih, and Deir en Nusmzny.

From Sileh, ’Orman, or Philippopolis, is reached in
three and a-half hours. The long-deserted ruins are of. con-
siderable extent, but there are no important ediﬁces. It was
probably called Philippopolis when Philip of Arabia was
chosen Emperor of Rome 1n 24.4 A. D.

An hour’s ride across a stony country brings the traveller
