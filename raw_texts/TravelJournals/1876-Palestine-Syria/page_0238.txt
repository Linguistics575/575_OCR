218 BETHLEHEM TO THE DEAD SEA.

ley of Heshbon) passes down by it on the north. The
Scripture account of the death of Moses is as follows :—
“ So Moses, the servant of the Lord, died there in the land
of Moab, according to the word of the Lord. And He buried
him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-pear,
but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day ” (Deut.
xxxiv. 5, 6, 7). It will be interesting to recall here the well-
. known lines of Mrs. Alexander :-—- ‘

By Nebo’s lonely mountain,
On this side Jordan‘s wave,

In a vale in the land of Moab,
There lies a lonely grave.

And no man knows that sepulchre,
And no man saw it e’er,
For the ﬁngers of God upturned the sod,
And laid the dead man there.
That was the grandest funeral
That ever passed on earth,
Yet no man heard the trampling,
Nor saw the train go forth. '

N oiselessly, as the sunlight
Comes back when night is done,
And crimson streak on ocean's cheek
Grows into the great sun.

So without sound of music,
Or voice of them that wept,
Silently down the mountain's crown
The great procession swept.

Perchance the bald old eagle
On grey Beth-peor’s height,
Out of his lonely eyrie
Looked on the wondrous sight.
Perchance the lion stalking
Still shuns the hallowed spot,
For beast and bird have seen and heard
That which man knoweth not.
