306 SEA OF GALILEE.

as watering the plain of Gennesareth. The bay is about
half a mile across, and on its western side is shut in by the
cliff of Khan Minyeh, the only place at which the shore of
the lake cannot be followed. There is a small tract of
fertile land, but we could ﬁnd no ruins except those connected
with the mills or waterworks. There are ﬁve fountains,
all more or less brackish, and varying in temperature from
7 3&9 to 86?; four are small, but the one mentioned above
is by far the largest spring in Galilee, and was estimated to be
more than half the size of the celebrated source of the Jordan
at Banias. . It rises to the surface with great force at a tem-
perature of 86?, which can hardly be considered warm in such
a climate as that of the lake district. Most of the water now
runs to waste, producing a quantity of rank luxuriant vege-
tation, but some of it is collected in a small reservoir, and is
thence carried off by an aqueduct to amill owned by a man of
Safed, the only one in working order of ﬁve that were built
by the great Chieftain, Dhaher el’Amr. The mills are small
towers, with two shafts, to the top of which the water is
brought by aqueducts, and then, falling down, turns the
machinery at the bottom. Connected with this fountain are
the remains of some remarkable works, which at one time
raised its waters to a higher level, and conveyed them bodily
into the plain of Gennesareth, for the purposes of irrigation.
The source is enclosed in an octagonal reservoir of great
strength, by means of which the water was raised about
twenty feet, to the level of an aqueduct that ran along the
side of the hill. Strong as the reservoir was, the water has
at last broken through it, and there is now little more than
two feet left at the bottom, in which a number of small ﬁsh
may be seen playing about. After leaving the reservoir, the
aqueduct can be traced at intervals following the contour of
the ground to the point where it crossed the beds of two
