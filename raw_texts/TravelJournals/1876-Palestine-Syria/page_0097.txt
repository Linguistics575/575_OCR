LYDDA. . 79

Palestine (1 Chron. viii. 12). After the Captivity, it was
occupied by the Benjamites (Ezra ii. 33 ; Neh. vii. 37). In
the time of Cassius Longinus, after the death of Julius
Caesar, the whole of the inhabitants were sold into slavery.
Here, under the second Gamaliel, a famous Rabbinical
School ﬂourished. Bishops of Lydda ﬁgure in early eccle~
siastical history, and in 415 a Council at this place welcomed
Pelagius as a Christian brother. In 1191 Saladin completely
destroyed the town. Its greatest interest to the traveller
will probably be its New Testament associations “It
came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters,
he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.
And then he found a certain man named Eneas, which
had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the
palsy. And Peter said unto him, Eneas, Jesus Christ
maketh thee wliole; arise, and make thy bed. And he
arose immediately, and all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron
(Sharon) saw him, and turned to the Lord ” (Acts ix.
32—35)-

The principal thing to see in Lydda is a very (ﬁne
Church, dedicated to St. George, who, according to some
traditions, was born and buried here. Justinian, it is said,
reared a church to his memory, which ediﬁce was destroyed
by the Saracens in the eighth century. It was rebuilt by
the Crusaders, destroyed by Saladin, and rebuilt by Richard
Cmur de Lion (?). The church is now in the possession of
the Greeks, and is shown by one of the monks from the
monastery. It will be seen that the present church IS made
up of much ancient material from the former churches on
this Spot.

Leaving the church and the mosque, the road to Ramleh .

trees, the road improving as we proceed, the town of Ramleh
