202 JERUSALEM TO HEBRON.

probably always was, what it now is, a khan. The camping
ground of tourists and pilgrims is just outside the walls of
the khan, and here a mixed multitude may generally be seen.
A short distance to the right of the castle is the Sealed
Fountain of Solomon (Song Sol. iv. 12) which, it is said,
regulated and secured the constant supply of water for the
Holy City. To visit it candles must be taken, as it is
approached by a ﬂight of twenty steps leading into a dark
vaulted chamber. In the dry season this spring supplies the
Pools with water.

The Pools are- three enormous cisterns of .marble
masonry, and their measurements are :— ' .

“ Lower Pool. Length, 582 feet; breadth, east end, 207
feet, west, 148 feet; depth at east end, 50 feet.” (Dr.
Thomson says that “ when full it would ﬂoat the largest
man-of-war 'that‘ever ploughed the ocean.”)

“Middle Pool. Distance above Lower Pool, 24.8 feet ;
length, 423 feet 5 breadth, at east end, 2 50 feet, west, 160 feet;
depth at east end, 39 feet. .

“ Upper Pool. Distance above Middle Pool, I60 feet;
length 380 feet 5 breadth, east end, 2 36, west 229 feet ; depth
at west end, 2 5 feet.”—(Rol:inson.)

From the admirable state of preservation these basins
are in, it is difﬁcult to realize that they are more than
a century old; it is most probable, however, that they date
from Solomon’s time, although they were restored by Pontius
Pilate. Formerly water was supplied to Jerusalem from
these pools, at the present time water is only conveyed
'as far as to Bethlehem, although the course of the
acqueduct can be traced all the way to the Haram, or
court of the Temple, a distance of twelve to fourteen miles

(13- 143). y
The name of Solomon’s Pools is taken from a passage in
