BETHEL. 245

grass-grown ﬁeld hard by, and as the “ wells of water ” in
Palestine are always surrounded with memorable associations,
the traveller is advised to resort thither in order to picture
the scenes of Bethel’s ancient glory. For the mere view,
however, the ruins of the tower on the top of the hill presents
a wider ﬁeld.

Bethel was the place where Abraham reared an altar,
and called upon the name of the Lord, who had just given
this land to him, and to his seed after him, for ever. From
here he went into Egypt, and fell into temptation, dishonour-
ing God before the heathen king, who sent him away out of
the land. “ And he went on his journeys from the south,
even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at
the beginning, between Bethel and Hai; unto the place of
the altar which he had made there at the ﬁrst: and- there
Abram called on the name of the Lord ” (Gen. xiii. 3—4).

Here Jacob, weary with his forty miles’ journey, and
away from home and kindred, “ took of the stones of that
place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down on that
place to sleep ” (Gen. xxviii. I I).

Here he saw the vision—the wondrous vision of angels
ascending and descending the mystic ladder, and when he
awoke he made the solemn vow which consecrated him to
the service of God.

The name of this place was Luz, but Jacob said, “This
is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of
heaven, and he called. the name of that place Bethel ” (i.e.,
the House of God). When Jeroboam sought to wean the
hearts of the people from the service of God at Jerusalem,
he set up here the golden calf, against which the prophet of
Judah was sent to cry in the name of the Lord, and, to
conﬁrm his mission by a sign, the altar was rent in pieces
by invisible hands. and its ashes poured out. Jeroboam
