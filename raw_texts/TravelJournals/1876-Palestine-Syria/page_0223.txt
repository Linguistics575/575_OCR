UR'riis. 203

Eocles. ii. 6, “ I made me pools of water to water therewith
the wood that bringeth forth trees.”

Good swimmers, when the pools are pretty full, some-
times indulge in a plunge here. Botanists will be well rewarded
for an exploration among the masonry of the Pools, and a
pleasant memento of the place is to bring away specimens
of maiden-hair ferns, which abound here.

A short distance below the Pools, in a valley, is the
village of Urt’ais (population 200), with a few ruins—pro-
bably those of Etham, a town fortiﬁed and garrisoned by
Rehoboam (2 Chron. xi. 16). JOSepbus states that this
city was ﬁfty stadia from Jerusalem, and thither Solomon
was “in the habit of taking a morning drive.” If this be
Etham, which is more than probable, then the beautiful
valley, rich in cultivation, corresponds with the Gardens of
Solomon, to which he referred when he wrote, “ I made me
great works 5 I builded me houses 5 I planted me vineyards;
I made me gardens, and orchards, and I planted in them of all
kind of fruits: I made me pools of water, to water therewith
the wood that bringeth forth trees " (Eccles. ii. 4—6). The
scenes in that curiously enigmatical Song of Songs are
laid in these gardens, and amdng these pools of water. It is
beautiful now 3 in Solomon’s time, “in the day of the glad-
ness of his heart,” it must have been exquisite, ﬁlled “with
pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard, spikenard and
saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankin-
cense, myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices ; a fountain
of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from
Lebanon ” (Song 801. iv. 13—15).

There is a small European colony here, and the people
are succeeding in making the “ wilderness to blossom as the
rose.” Mr. Meshallum, a Christian colonist, has done much
for the neighbourhood. Fruit and vegetables are raised here
