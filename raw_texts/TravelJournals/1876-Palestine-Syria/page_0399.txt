BEYROUT. 3 7 9

The Giblites, or people of Gebal, were also famous as ship-
builders. “ The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof
were in thee " (Tyre and Sidon) “ thy calkers: all the ships
of the sea, with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy
merchandise ” (Ezek. xxvii. 9).

The Nahr—el-Kelh (Dog River) (p. 372) is the next
place of great interest, and from thence it is an easy and
pleasant ride by the sea-shore to Beyrout (p. 367).
