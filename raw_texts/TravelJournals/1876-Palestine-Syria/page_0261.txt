AI T0 BETHEL. 241

Joshua vii. and viii., and the traveller will have a vivid picture
of the battle before him as he reads it here.

“Without any reasonable doubt, this is the site of Ai.
It corresponds exactly to the description, when we know the
site of Bethel and the site of Abraham’s encampment, where
he built an altar, for we read that he pitched his camp, having
Bethel in the north and Hai in the east. There is a valley
behind the ruined heap, where Joshua placed his ambush.
There is the spot opposite, across the intervening valley,
where Joshua stood to give the preconcerted signal; and
there is the plain or ridge, down which the men of Ai
hurried in pursuit of the retreating Israelites, so that the men
in ambush rose and captured the city, and made it a ‘ heap ’
or ‘tell’ for ever. Mr. George Williams has pointed out
that the word which is translated ‘ heap ’ in our version
exactly corresponds to the Arab rendering ‘tell.’ ”--( Our
Work in Palestine.) ‘

‘ From Ai t0 Bethel (p. 24.4.) is a journey of a little less
than three-quarters of an hour, by a lofty and pleasant plain
sacred with associations connected with patriarchal history,
as it was traversed by Abram—who reared his altar between
‘7 Bethel and Ai”-—and Lot and Jacob.

[From Ai, a pleasant journey may be made to Rimmon
(Rammﬁn), where the last of the Benjamites dwelt (Judges
xx., xxi.), and to Ophrah, a position held by the Philistines
(1 Sam. xiii. 17). Some have sought to identify it with the
city of Ephraim, to which our Lord retired after the raising
of Lazarus; “ Jesus therefore walked no more openly
among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to
the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there con-
tinued with his disciples ” (John xi. 54). From Ophrah to
Bethel is a journey of about an hour and three-quarters]
