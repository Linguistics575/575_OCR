EN-SHEMESH. 237

travelling and hotel accommodation; but on Saturday last
the blessings of two-score ladies and gentlemen, to say no-
thing of as many saddle-horses, three-score mules, and one-
score donkeys, with nearly three-score muleteers, drago-
mans, and camp-servants, were cheerfully awarded to the
lady who honoured her title by this useful outlay of money.
Who can tell that this improvement may not lead to the
cultivation of those once fertile plains which lie between the
fountain of Elisha and the Jordan? What the Nile does
for Egypt, the Jordan on one side, and copious fountains on
the other, might do for the plains of Jericho and the Jordan,
if practicable, and every means of irrigation were adopted.”—
Cook.

Looking back, several very interesting views ; a few ruins
are passed on the road, and several interesting valleys are
crossed.

After riding about three hours from ’Ain-es-Sultan, we
come to an old ruined khan; no accommodation can be
obtained here, the few buildings are uninhabited, and the
water is unﬁt to drink. This is the traditional scene of the
parable of the Good Samaritan, who rescued the certain man
going “ down from Jerusalem to Jericho.”

In two hours from the khan, the traveller reaches
another khan, where the water is excellent, and where
travellers usually halt for their mid-day meal. There are
now but few traces of the old khan, which once stood here,
or of the arch covering the cistern, into which the water
ﬂows from the spring. It has been called the Apostles'
Spring, from the legend that here the Apostles tarried on
their journeyings 5 there is little doubt that this fountain of
’Ain-el-Haud, or ’Ain-Chot, is identical with En-Shemesh
(Spring of the Sun), a fountain on the boundary between
Judah and Benjamin (Joshua xv. 7, xviii. 17).
