242 JERUSALEM T0 SAMARIA.

FROM JERUSALEM TO SAMARIA.

Leaving Jerusalem by the Jaﬁ‘a Gate, and passing round
by the Russian Quarter to the Damascus Gate, or leaving
Jerusalem by the Damascus Gate, the route leads by the
Tombs of the Kings (p. 179) and the hill Scopus (p. 175).
Looking back from this point, the view of Jerusalem is.
remarkably ﬁne, and usually—as it is most frequently the
traveller’s last view of the Holy City—leaves an indelible
impression on the mind. Nearly every traveller has de-
scribed his emotions on leaving Jerusalem, and in the vast
majority of instances his last view has been obtained from
this spot. Here Crusaders, pilgrims of all ages, devotees of
all phases of religion, have experienced emotion; and the
place has therefore a sacredness of its own. If it be pos-
sible, every traveller should get his ﬁrst view of Jerusalem
from the Mount of Olives, as you come from Bethany, and
the last View from this hill of Scopus.

Passing over a broad plain, and taking a northerly direc-
tion, we see, on the left, the village of Shéfat, with part
of a ruined church or tower, and cisterns hewn in the
rock. There are ﬁne views from the hill of Tuleil-el-Fﬁl, a
short distance further on. Shafat is identiﬁed by Mr.
Porter as the site of the ancient Nob, a priestly city of
Benjamin, the place where the Tabernacle and Ark were
stationed in the time of Saul, to which David ﬂed (1 Sam.
xxi. 4). Abimelech the priest, having received Saul as a
refugee, was informed against by Doeg the Edomite, and
Nob was smitten with the edge of the sword in conse-
quence (I Sam. xxii. 9—:9).

Tuliel-el-Flil (the Little Hill of Beans) is, without
doubt, the Gibeah of Saul, the native place of the ﬁrst King
of Israel, and the seat of government during the greater part
