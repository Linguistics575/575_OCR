74 JAFFA TO JERUSALEM.

have been so successful, that a piece of land has been pur-
chased on which a large, substantial house has been erected,
suitable for the requirements of her work. Already there are
from ﬁfty to sixty pupils in the day-school, about sixty
persons assemble every Sunday for Protestant worship, and
there are thirteen boarders in training as teachers. £10 per
annum is the cost of maintaining and thoroughly educating
a girl in the house. .

Just outside Jaffa, to the north, or left of the gate, is a
miserable Mahomedan cemetery, and beyond this, close to
the Jerusalem Hotel, is the German Colony. A colony
was founded here, in the ﬁrst instance (1866), by some
Americans, but their scheme was unsuccessful, and when
the Quaker City visited Jaﬁ‘a it took away the bulk of the
colonists to Egypt, from whence they were assisted back
again to America 5 a party of Germans then took possession
of the spot and continue there to this day. They number
about forty families, and although, with the many unfavourable
circumstances around them, they make slow progress, it is a
fact that they make progress. The tourist who is inte-
rested in the question of what Palestine is capable of becom-
ing (see p. 118) will do well to visit this colony, and extend
his journey to Sarona, a little to the north.

The journey may be made on horseback, by carriage, or,
by the inﬁrm, in a palanquin.

There are two routes. (1) From Jaﬁ'a to Ramleh direct
