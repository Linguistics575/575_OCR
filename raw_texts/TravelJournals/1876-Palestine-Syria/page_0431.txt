MOUNT CARMEL. 41 I

Asher, who also held a portion of the rich agricultural plain
of Sharon, to the south of Carmel. We read previously in
chap. xii. of a king of “Jokneam of Carmel,” as being
defeated by the Israelites. But the'chief biblical associations
of Carmel are with the history of Elijah and Elisha.

At the eastern end of the ridge, where the view extends
over the great plain, doubtless occurred the extraordinary
events related in I Kings xvii‘i.

“ We stopped at E1 Mouhrakah,” says M. de Pressensé,
“situated on the mountain at ﬁve-and-a-half hours’ distance
from the convent. This is the spot marked by tradition for
Elijah’s sacriﬁce. El Mouhrakah is a natural terrace, com-
manding all the Plain of Esdraelon. Enormous blocks of
stone strew the path. The site answers exactly to the
account given in the book of Kings (1 Kings xviii. 20).
Behind us is the great sea from which the Prophet saw the
little cloud, like a man’s hand, arise, which was to spread
over all the scorched land and pour a healing rain. The
Kishon, reddened with the blood of the priests of Baal after
their shameful defeat, ﬂows through the plain at the foot of
Carmel. Before us is Jezreel, to which the king repaired
in his chariot on the prophetic announcement of the coming
miracle. The horizon of mountains is very extensive from
this height, and forms a graceful curve, commencing with
the mountains of Samaria, and terminating in the furthest
hills of Galilee. Tabor fronts the Spectator; it looks like
the rounded dome of a Byzantine basilica formed by nature.
The Plain of Esdraelon unfolds its dazzling robe between
Tabor and Carmel, while on the side of the sea the plain
which reaches to Jaffa and the Mediterranean melts into
shining distance. Around us, Carmel extends in all directions,
its green groves and ﬂowery slopes.”

Another startling incident in'the life of Elijah is con-
