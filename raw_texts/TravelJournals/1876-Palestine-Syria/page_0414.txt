394 GAZA TO HEBRON.

now called ’Ajilﬁn. A mound of ruins and rubbish are all
that remains. Its capture, and the hanging of its king at
Makkedah, are recorded in the chapter just alluded to.

The road continues eastward over the undulating plain.
It is a district still little cultivated, and overrun with
wandering Arabs. In the district running southwards to
the valley of Gerar, the ﬂocks of Abraham and Isaac were
pastured. Many mounds of rubbish are seen, denoting
former towns and 'villages. But the general desolation of
the scene is very striking, bringing to mind the words of the
Prophet, “ O Canaan, the land of the Philistine, I will even
destroy thee'that there shall be no inhabitant ” (Zeph. ii. 5).

The deserted village of Es-Sukkar’iyeh, or the Sugary,
where there are some remains of columns and capitols, is
passed, and also Tell-el-Kubeibeh. After crossing some
low ridges, in about an hour the valley of Beit Jibrin is
reached, and the Shephelah, or low country, is left fairly
behind. The traveller is now entering the hill country, and
the border-land between Judah and Philistia, so rich in
historical and biblical associations. The ridges and green
glens are now studded with villages, corn grows on the
terraces, and the vines are festooned about the rocks. Caves
abound everywhere, and every town shows traces of forti-
ﬁcations of some sort. In short, everything here shows, as
it ever has shown, the necessities and precautions of a border-
land.

Beit Jibr’in is identiﬁed with Eleuthempolis,
not a biblical site (unless, as Dr. Thomson, suggests, it be
also accepted as the site of Gath). But Eleutheropoli‘s is
of considerable importance in the geography of Southern
Palestine, as from it Eusebius and jerome calculate the dis-
tance and direction of the many sacred spots which are
clustered round.
