88 JAFFA T.0 JERUSALEM.

hour we reach the top of a hill, where there is a ruined
castle calledgKustal, probably from castellum, castle. From
here there is a good view, including N eby Samwil, the tradi-
tional burial-place of the prophet Samuel, and the ancient
Mizpeh (p. 97).

From Kustal a descent of half an hour brings the tra-
veller into the Valley Of Kolonieh, by a zig-zag road.
To the right is a beautiful little village, called ’Ain Karim ;
it is situated in the midst of olive, ﬁg, and other fruit trees,
and has a population of about 800, mostly Christians. Tra-
dition makes it the birth-place of St. John the Baptist 5 the
arguments being that as Zacharias, his father, was a priest,
he would live near Jerusalem, and in Luke i. 39, his resi-
dence is described as “ in the hill country in a city of Judah.”

Kolonieh (Colom'a) is about a quarter of an hour further
on 5 it is a pretty little place, with orchards, gardens, and
groves. This has been considered by many to be the Emmaus
of St. Luke’s gospel; but so has N icopolis (p. 84), Kirjath-
jearim (p. 86), saris (p. 8 5), and Kubeibeh, three miles west
of Mizpeh (p. 97). There is nothing but conjecture to
go upon, and therefore each traveller will probably decide the
point, in his own imagination at least, for himself. St. Luke
says Emmaus was “ threescore. furlongs from Jerusalem ”
(Luke xxiv. 13), and Josephus mentions a village of the same
name at the same distance from Jerusalem. Kolonieh, the
Site favoured by Mr. Grove, is as much too near Jerusalem as
Séris is too far. _ '

In the valley of Kolonieh is a bridge, crossing the bed of
the valley, and here travellers have been in the habit- of
gathering “ smooth stones out of the brook,” in memory of
the conﬂict between David and Goliath, which tradition has
located here. The site does not, however, agree with the
Scripture narrative (p. 400). '
