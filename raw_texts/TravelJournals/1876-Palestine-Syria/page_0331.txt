.SAFED. 31 I

The houses of the Jews in Safed are built on terraces
which rise in {succession one above another. The roofs of
each lower tier serve as a path or street to those who live in
the next higher tier. The city, from its situation—which is
considered very healthy, and especially for those who have
been in the excessively close and furnace-like heat of the Sea
of Tiberias—has been by some supposed to be “ the city set
on a hill, which cannot be hid ” (Matt. v. 14), but there is
no evidence forthcoming to show that there was any city on
this particular hill in the time of our Lord.

On the highest peak of the hill stand the ruins of a
castle, built by the Franks during the Crusades, and upon
which they relied as their main defence against the incursions
of the Saracens from the north. It passed repeatedly during
the Holy Wars from the hands of one of the combatants to
those of the other. The Turkish Governor of the town had
his quarters here as late as 1837, when there occurred that
terrible earthquake which caused such havoc in Tiberias
(p. 293). Here it shook down the castle, and precipitated
the “upper street ” on to the lower. The sufferings of the
people who perished lingeringly among the ruins were most
appalling. The horrible scene was witnessed by Dr. Thom-
son, by whom it has been most graphically described (see
The Land and the Book). He says, “ The whole town was
dashed to the ground in half a minute. I understood then
for the ﬁrst time what desolations God can work, when He
causeth to shake terribly the earth.” After describing how
the town, built upon tiers, fell, burying each successive row
of houses deeper and deeper under accumulated masses of
rubbish, he exclaims, “ O God of mercy! my heart even now
sickens at the thought of that long black winter’s night,
which closed around the wretched remnants of Safed in half
an hour after the overthrow, without a light or possibility of
