watch him coming down that steep hill with the ass laden
by his father, on his way to Saul, and we note the tender
care with which he holds the harp, that friend of his soli-
tude and minister of his joy—that instrument which shall
be in his hand as powerful over the giant Saul as the sling
and the stone (his boyhood’s toys) shall be over the giant
Goliath.”—-—(Hodder.)

BETHLEHEM (BEIT-LAH M).

Bethlehem (House of Bread), or Beit-Lahm, is situated
six miles from Jerusalem, on an elongated hill, well culti-
vated in terraces round the sides, and with fertile corn-ﬁelds
in the valley below. On the terraces, vines and fig-trees
are in abundance. The wine of Bethlehem has con-
siderable local celebrity, but does not appear to be appre-
ciated by all travellers.

The town consists of about ﬁve hundred houses, mostly
substantial, and the fortress-like buildings of the Church
of the Nativity and the three adjoining convents. The
streets are narrow, steep, and slippery. From the Con-
vent of Mar Eyas and other neighbouring points of view,
Bethlehem forms a pleasing picture—the square, solid-built .
houses, with a good Sprinkling of cupolas rising above each
other in terraces, like the gardens and groves just below them.

The population is about 4,000. The inhabitants of
Bethlehem have always been celebrated for their ruddy
beauty, and also for their ﬁerce turbulence, inclined, like
David, to be “ men of war from their youth,” and, it is said,
always conspicuous in the frequent religious disturbances at
Jerusalem. Bethlehem is the most Christian town in
Palestine; the Muslim Quarter was destroyed by Ibrahim
Pasha after a rebellion in 1834.
