MOUNT TABOR. 237

:8, 19), and in the Psalms and elsewhere it is-mentioned in
poetical and ﬁgurative allusions. “ The north and the south
thou hast created them : Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in
Thy name ” (Psalm lxxxix. 12). The Prophet Jeremiah,
when telling how N ebuchadnezzar, king. of .Babylon, should
come and smite the land of Egypt, utters these words: “ As

the scene of the Transﬁguration is, that it is selected only
because it is a “ high mountain apart,” and many such may
be found in Galilee, and during the lifetime of our Lord the
top of Tabor was, without doubt, occupied by a strongly

The true site of the -Holy Mount may be looked for
with greater probability On one of the slopes of Hermon
(p. 324.). As, however, Tabor was the most conspicuous
of the Galilean hills, it was only natural that pilgrims should
have regarded it as the Holy Mount, and, towards the end
of the sixth century, erect here three churches—“ one for
