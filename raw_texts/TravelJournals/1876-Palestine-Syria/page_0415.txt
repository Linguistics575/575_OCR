BEIT JIBRTN. 395

Beit Jibr’in was originally Betogabra, “ House of Gabrael,”
or, as Dr. Thomson says, "‘ House of Giants.” Ptolemy
mentions it under this name. In the time of Eusebius it
was a ﬂourishing town and bishopric, known as Eleuthe-
ropolis, or the Free City. But its Greek name and Greek
civilization disappeared in the eighth century, under the
ravages of the Muslims. An Arabic town sprang up, re-
viving the ancient name in a modiﬁed form, as Beigebrin.
Frank and Paynim alternately held the place in the time of
the Crusades. Here, on the old foundations, was reared a
fortress, of which the Knights Hospitallers were appointed
defenders. '

The boundaries of the Ancient Castle just alluded to
are plainly marked by an immense quadrangular inclosure.
It was built of large stones, and enclosed a space of 600 ft.
square. The castle itself is about zoo ft. square—all is now
little more than a heap of massive ruins, heaped up amongst
a confused mass of arches, and vaults, and broken walls.

The Caves in the vicinity of Beit Jibr’in, considered by
some to be the work of Idumaean Horites, or cave-dwellers,
are intensely interesting.

The Rev. J. L. Porter, in his GiantZC'ities (yo Bashan, says
of these caves: “ They are unique in plan and character—
altogether different from the temple tombs of Egypt and
the beautiful rock chambers of Petra, and the intricate
sepulchres of Jerusalem. Here are long ranges of bell—
shaped chambers, some of them seventy feet in diameter and
sixty high, connected by arched doorways and winding sub-
terranean passages, and long ﬂights of steps ascending and
descending. Many are entirely dark; others are lighted by
a circular aperture at the top; the roofs of others are par-
tially fallen in, leaving jagged openings, through which the
sunlight streams, and long brambles hang down. Side-
