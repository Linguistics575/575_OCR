The people are celebrated for their kindness and cour-
teousness. They are a better class of people altogether than
is to be met with in any town in Palestine; their dwellings
are cleaner and their habits altogether different from those
met with elsewhere. The women are proverbial for their
beauty, although it is doubtful which carry the palm—ethe
women of Nazareth, or those of Bethlehem. "

Nazareth was the residence of Joseph and Mary, and the
scene of the Annunciation. “ The angel Gabriel was sent
from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a virgin
espoused to a man whose name was Joseph ” (Luke
i. 26, 27). From here Joseph went up toBethlehem, “‘ to
be taxed with Mary his espoused wife ” (ii. 4.). After the
return from Egypt, this was the home of our Lord until
He entered upon His public ministry, “ that it might be fol:
ﬁlled which was spoken by the prophet, He shall be called
a Nazarene ” (Matt. ii. 23). When entering upon His
public ministry, “ Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and
was baptized of John in Jordan ” (Matt. iii. I 3). After-
wards, “ He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought
up ” (Luke iv. 16). And then His fellow townsfolk sought
to kill Him. They “rose up, and thrust Him out of the
city, and led Him unto the brow of the hill whereon their
city was built, that they might cast Him down headlong.
But He passing through the midst of them went his way,
and came down to Capernaum ” (iv. 29—31). Henceforth,
Capernaum was His own city, and it does not appear that
He ever again visited the scene of His boyhood and early
manhood, although He must have seen it in the distance, as
He passed by on His journey to Jerusalem.
