THE DEAD SEA. 221

its greatest length, and nine and a half in the greatest width,
at ’Ain Turabeh, about ﬁfteen miles south of the Jordan.
In the rainy seasons the sea is extended southward for some
miles 3 the measurements, therefore, differ according to the
season of the year3 those given above were made by the
American Expedition in the month of April, at which time
it may be considered at its maximum. The area is about
250 geographical miles; its mean depth is 1,080 feet 3 in
the south bay the depth does not exceed eleven feet. _

Lying, as it does, I, 300 feet below the level of the
Mediterranean, it is the most depressed sheet of water in the
world. One of the most singular features of the lake is the
tongue of land running into it from the land of Moab, and
six miles across its narrow neck. Into this lake the waters
of the Jordan empty themselves, and are lost. It receives
also, from the east, the Z’urka Ma’in, the Mojib (supposed
to be the Arnon of Scripture), and the Beni Hemﬁd 3 from
the south, the Karéhy 3 and from the west, ’Ain Jidy, beside
a considerable number of other springs.

The nauseous and malignant character of the water of the
Dead Sea is “ owing to the extraordinary amount of mineral
salts held in solution. The analyses of chemists, however,
show very different results. Some give only seventy parts of
water to the hundred; while others give eighty, or even more.
I account for these differences by supposing that the specimens
analysed are taken at different seasons of the year, and at
different distances from the Jordan. Water brought from
near the mouth of that river might be comparatively fresh,
and that taken in winter from any part would be less salt
and bitter than what was brought away in autumn. One
analysis shows-‘—Chloride of sodium, 8 3 potassium, I 3
calcium, 3. The very last I have seen gives—Calcium, 2:3
‘chloride of magnesium, 10% 3 of potassium, 133 of sodium,
