be found are the Papyrus Syriacus, tamarisk and willow,
marsh orchis and gladiolus; intersPersed with the cultivated
portions of the land are wildernesses full of tall thistles, arti-
chokes, knapweed (Centaurea), hollyhocks, and other tall
plants 3 Prasium majus,Acanthus spinosus, Ononis antiguarum,
etc. The gazelle and wild boar ﬁnd shelter among them.

The Hill Country of Galilee is very similar in its natural
productions to that of Judaaa. Labiate and leguminous
plants abound. The mandrake is common; anemone, tulip,
grape-hyacinths, many Species of arum and of iris; and in
the basin of the Lake of Gennesareth and the swamps of
Hﬁleh (Merom) we ﬁnd tropical or semi-tropical plants;
F agonia, Zizyphus, Astragalus, Ipomea (convolvulus), castor—
oil, wild rose, Oleander, tamarisk, and the true Egyptian
papyrus. Yellow and white water-liles grow plentifully in
Lake Hﬁleh. Cotton is cultivated here. The wild olive
disappears in Galilee, the storax becomes rare, and the oak
predominates over other trees; the woodbine (Lonicera im-
plexa) is common, and the oriental misletoe grows in the
olive-yards, and the European species on the poplars ascend-
ing towards Mount Hermon. The walnut takes the place
of the wild olive, and the wild pear ﬂourishes on the high
ground. Rare kinds of ducks and herons, as the white
egret, abound in Lake Hﬁleh, and the purple gallinule, or
great water-hen, may often be seen.

The Slopes of Hermon and Lebanon are clothed with a
partially Alpine vegetation. Astragalus, the small poppy,
Papaver rhesus, Glaucium vitelh'num, Rosa spinosissima, cress
(Lepidz'um sativum), Alsim' junipen'na, galium of various
kinds, the Persian goat’s-beard, an alkana, forget-me-not,
Speedwell, several kinds of salvia or sage, Fumaria, Dralva
vesicaria and D. villosa, Geranium tuberosum and Bierberstem'a
mult‘iﬁda, the primrose Androsace oil/0.9a, anchusa, Ixolirion
