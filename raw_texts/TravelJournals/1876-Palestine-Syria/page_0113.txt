EL-JIB (GIBEON) . 95

Gibeon (belonging to a hill—i.e., a hill city) was one of
the most important cities of the Hivites (Joshua ix. 7, x. 2,
xi. 19). It lay within the territory of Benjamin (Joshua xviii.
2 5).

From this place went the cunning townsfolk to obtain a
league with Joshua. They went with “ sacks upon their
asses, and wine-bottles old, and rent, and bound up, and old
shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon
them, and all the bread of their provision dry and-musty.”
In this way they journeyed to Joshua at Gilgal, representing
that they had come from “a very far country.” .Joshua’s
heart was touched, and he made a league with them to let
them and their people live. He was entrapped, for he
soon discovered them to be near neighbours 5 yet for his
oath’s sake he let them live; but he made them “ hewers of .
wood and drawers of water ” (or slaves) to the whole congre-
gation thenceforth for ever (Joshua ix.)

Joshua came to the defence of the Gibeonites when they
were besieged by the ﬁve kings of the Amorites (p. 92)
and in the great battle which followed, “the sun stood still
upon Gibeon ” (Joshua x. 12).

Afterwards Gibeon became a city of the Levites (Joshua
.xviii. 2 5) _; and here came the tabernacle after its wilderness
journey, and here it stayed until the completion of Solo-
mon’s Temple, while the ark was at Jerusalem. There is
much controversy as to whether the “ high place of Gibeon”
is this bill of El-Jib, or the more commanding site of .Neby
Samwil; the weight of evidence seems in favour of the
latter. Stanley places Mizpeh on Scopus (p. 175).

Here came “Zadok the priest, and his brethren the
priests, before the tabernacle of the Lord in the high place
that was at Gibeon, to offer burnt-offerings unto the Lord
upon the altar of the burnt-offering continually morning and
