TOMBS OF THE KINGS. ' 179

The Greeks claim that this is the oldest Christian
church in the world. They perform a service here every
morning from 7 to 8.30 a.m., and it is open all day on
Festivals. At other times, visitors should knock at the little
iron-door, on the south side of the church.

From the Kidron we ascend the hill to St. Stephen’s
Gate (p. 116), passing the traditional spot (at the foot of
the hill where the road turns to the right, and on a ledge
to the left), where St. Stephen was stoned.

The View from St. Stephen’s Gate is remarkable.
Across the narrow valley rises the Mount of , Olives,
stretching so far from north to south as to intercept entirely
the view towards the east. The top is not level, but is
notched with three summits, the middle one of which is the
highest, on which stands the Chapel of the Ascension.
Three paths, deeply worn, lead over the Mount (see p. 171).
The enclosure of Gethsemane, at the foot of the Mount, is
well seen from here (p. 177). On our left, under the wall,
is a large reservoir, the Hammam Sitti Mayam, or Bath of
Our Lady, where people come to draw water and to bathe.
On the right is the Mahomedan Cemetery, covering a great
part of the eastern slope of Moriah.

Continuing past the north-east corner of. the city walls
and striking off to the north-north-west, a journey of about
half an hour brings us to the

I Tombs of the Kings (or Helena).

Three classes of excavated tombs are found in Pales-
tine :— .

soft limestone, and closed up by rough stone slabs.

2. Those formed into square or oblong chambers cut in
