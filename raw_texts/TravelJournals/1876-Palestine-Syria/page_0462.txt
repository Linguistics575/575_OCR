markable square toWer, thirty feet in height, is seen. It is
ornamented with Doric semi-columns, between which war—
like trophies, shields and helmets, are sculptured in relief.
It is inscribed, “Odainatus, son of Anuelos, built this
monument to Chamrate, his wife.”

The ruins, which are approached by a Roman arch span-

other ediﬁces. Here, as in other ruined cities of Bashan,
