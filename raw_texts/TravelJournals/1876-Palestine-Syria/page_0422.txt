Jibrin is crossed near one of the ﬁnest specimens of the
terebinth to be found in all Syria. Half a mile further on
the Wady-es-Sumt (Valley of Elah) is entered near Sochoh,
and then Beit Nettif is soon reached.]

Where time is not of consequence, the détour described at
p. 398 from Beit Jibr’in to Gath, Elah, etc., to Beit Nettif,
can be combined with the journey from Hebron to Jaﬂ'a.

Leaving Beit Nettif, the traveller proceeds northward.

This town is referred to in several other passages of
Scripture. King Amaziah, of Judah, was taken prisoner by
