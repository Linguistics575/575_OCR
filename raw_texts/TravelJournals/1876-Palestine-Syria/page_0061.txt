PILGRIMS ,AND PILGRIMAGES. 43

empire, and settled down into peaceful and prOSperous sub-
jects.

Early in the fourth century the Princess Helena came to
Palestine, and erected grand churches on the more or less
authentic sites of Christian events. Pilgrimages grew
fashionable. In 384., Saint Jerome came to Bethlehem,
and at this time Palestine was swarming with monks, nuns,
and hermits. Julian the Apostate, in order to falsify the
prophecies, tried to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem, but
failed.

“ Pilgrimages to the Holy Land,” says E. de Pressensé,
“ became, from the time of Helena, more and more numerous.
The most illustrious of pilgrims was St. Jerome. The Cave
of Bethlehem became the scene of his conﬂicts and labours.
The star which had guided the Magi to this place arose
upon him in the stormy night of his youth. It led him, as it
had led them, to the Cradle of the Holy Child, there to offer
incessantly the treasures of his rich intelligence, the frank-
incense and myrrh of his ardent adoration. From the depths
of this obscure retreat he takes part in all the great conﬂicts
of the Church of the fourth century, sends forth the sword-
thrusts of his impassioned words, and gathers round him
great Roman ladies whom he teaches to be humble servants
of Christ. . . The example of Jerome was followed by
many pious anchorites. The caves near the Kidron, on the
banks of the Dead Sea, were the favourite retreat of these
new ascetics. They found on those arid sands, and amidst
that devastated nature, at once those grand. religious associ-
ations which elevate the soul, and that aspect of external
severity which their austerity demanded. About the year
Goo, twenty monasteries had risen in these countries-—
more than ten thousand monks peopled the solitudes of
Engedi. ’
