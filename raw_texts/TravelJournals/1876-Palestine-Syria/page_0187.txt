This hill is also called the Hill of Evil Counsel,
fromatradition thatinthe countryhouse of Caiaphas the

En—Rogel

is situated in one or two places, according to the sides
taken in various controversies. Grove places it at
Bir Eyulv, below Siloam; others at the Fountain of the
Virgin, a few hundred yards further oﬁ; others at Ex
Zeluvele, corresponding with the stone of Zoheleth (1 Kings
i. 9). If this latter be the site——and the balance of evidence
seems in its favour—it is on the western face of the rocky
plateau which slightly overhangs the valley of the village of
Siloam. Along this troublesome and almost dangerous
pathway of rudely-cut steps, the women of Siloam pass and
re—pass continually on their way to the Virgin’s Fountain
for water.

At En-Rogel, Jonathan and Ahimaaz waited for intelli-
gence to convey to David in the time of his trouble, “ For
they might not be seen to come into the city ” (2 Samuel
xvii. 17). When Adonijah “ exalted himself, saying I will
be king,” he celebrated his coronation feast here. “ And
Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of
Zoheleth, which is by En-Rogel " (1 Kings i. 9).

The modern Arab village is called Silwén, which: is
a miserable place, some of the huts being old sepulchres
