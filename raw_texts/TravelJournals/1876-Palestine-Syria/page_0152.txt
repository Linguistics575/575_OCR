occur as that recorded in Curzon’s Monasteries of the Levant.
In 18 34. the seething crowd came to a disturbance, the finale
of which is thus graphically described by an eye-witness :---

“ The guards outside, frightened at the rush from within,
thought that the Christians wished to attack them, and the
confusion soon grew into a battle. The soldiers, with their
bayonets, killed numbers of fainting wretches, and the walls
were spattered with the blood and brains of men who had
been felled like oxen with the butt—ends of the soldiers’
muskets. Every one struggled to defend himself, and in the
mé'le’e all who fell were immediately trampled to death by
the, rest. So desperate and savage did the ﬁght become, that
even thepanic-stricken and frightened pilgrims appeared at
last to have been more intent upon the destruction of each
other than desirous to save themselves. For my part, as
soon as I had perceived the danger, I cried to my companions
to turn back, which they had done, but I myself was carried
on. by the press till I came near the door, where all were
ﬁghting for their lives. Here, seeing certain destruction
beforegme, I made every endeavour to get back. An ofﬁcer
of the Pasha, equally alarmed with myself, was also trying
to return. He caught hold of my cloak and pulled me down
onithe body of an old man who'was breathing out his last
sigh. As the ofﬁcer was pressing me to the ground, we
wrestled together among the dying and the dead with the
energy of despair. I struggled with this man till I pulled
him down, and happily got away upon my legs (I after-
wards discovered that he never rose again), and, scrambling
over a pile of corpses, I made my way back into the body
of the church. The dead were lying in heaps, even upon the
Stone of Unction; and I saw full four hundred wretched
people, dead and dying, heaped promiscuOusly one upon
another, in some places above ﬁve feet high.”
