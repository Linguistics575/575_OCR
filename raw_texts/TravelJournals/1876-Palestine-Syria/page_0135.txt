The second was the city of Solomon, from 3.0. 1000 to
3.0. 597, a space of 4.00 years. Thethird, that of Nehemiah,
which lasted for some. 300 years. Then came the magni-
ﬁcent City of Herod; then the Roman city, which grew
up on e ruins Titus had made; it again was followed by
the M omedan city; and that again by a Christian city;
and now, for six hundred years, the modern city has stood
on the ruins of those that preceded it. ” So we can well con-
ceive what good ground the Commitme: e to write thus.
“Rubbish and débris cover every foot oft e gror1‘nM‘~
where the rock crops up at intervals. The rubbish IS the
wreck of all these cities, piled one above the other. If we
examine it, we have to determine at every step among the
ruins of which city we are - standing — Solomon, Nehe-
miah, Herod, Hadrian, Constantine, Omar, Godfrey,
Saladin, Suleiman—each in turn represents a city. It has
been the task of the Fund to dig down to the rock itself, and
lay .bare the secrets of each in succession.”—-—(E. Condor Gray.)

Among many other difﬁculties which the Explorers have
had to encounter may be mentioned the looseness of the
débris, causing much danger to the excavators; the-impure
state of the soil, saturated with the sewage of ages; the
opposition of the Muslims, the interference of the Pasha
and local authorities, the indolence of Oriental workmen—
notwithstanding all this, the results have been most satisfac-
tory, and will be referred to in their pr0per places in the
description of the City.
