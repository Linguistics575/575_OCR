When the traveller, proceeding on his journery, ascends

From Bethany to Jerusalem (see p. 171).

FROM JERUSALEM TO BETHEL, BY
ANATHOTH, MICHMASH, AND Al.

Leave Jerusalem by the Damascus Gate, turn to the
north-east, cross the valley, and ascend to the Hill Scopus
(p. 175). Then down into the bed of another valley, and on
N the ridge of the opposite hill will be seen the little village of
’Anata, corresponding with the Anathoth of Scripture.
It was a town of the Levites in the territory of Benjamin
(Joshua xxi. 18), to which Abiathar was banished by Solomon.
“ So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from' being priest unto
the Lord 5 that he might fulﬁl the word of the Lord, which
he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh (1 Kings
ii. 26, 27). Here Jeremiah the prOphet was born ; he was
“the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were of Anathoth in
the land of Benjamin ” (Jer. i. I). Here the word of the
Lord came unto him, and he received commandment to pro-
phecy against the men of Anathoth, who sought his life.
“Behold, I will punish them . . by famine: and there
shall be no remnant of them : for I will bring evil upon the
men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation ”
(xi. 21—23). Isaiah prOphesying of the destruction coming
upon it,———as it stood in the direct line of the march of the
Assyrians as they advanced to Jerusalem—cried, “ 0 poor
Anathoth ! ” (Isa. x. 30). There are still some ruins here
dating from a very early period, amongst them traces of an
ancient wall and rock-hewn cisterns. The View from here
is very extensive. . '
