TOURS EAST OF THE JORDAN. 449

Sunamein has two lofty towers, which possibly give
the place its name (“The Two Idols ”). There are many
massive and beautiful remains of ancient ediﬁces. One
limestone temple is very noticeable.

Between Sunamein and Kesweh the traveller passes
Glmbaghib, with its fortiﬁed khan; Kusr Far’on, or Pharaoh’s
Castle, on its isolated rock; the dilapidated caravansary of
K hon Dentin, where the pilgrims make their second halt
from Damascus; and the bare rocks of j’ebel Mani'a, crowned
by a ruined castle on the right of the Plain of Khiyara.

Kesweh is a Mahomedan village on the banks of the
’Awaj, ancient Pharpar (p. 3 30). The view down the valley
is very ﬁne. After crossing febel-es-Aswad, Damascus is
seen, with its gardens, and in about a couple of hours the
city gates are reached.

we cross the river at the Ford due east of Jericho. Hence
the route is along the Wady Heshbon. The ruins of Beth-
aran or Beth-haran (Joshua xiii. 27, Numbers xxxii. 36),
now called Ramah, are passed, and then commences the
ascent of El Belka, the mountains of Moab. The traveller is
now tracing the route down which the Iraelites returned
