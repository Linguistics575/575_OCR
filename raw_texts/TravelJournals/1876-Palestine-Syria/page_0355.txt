marching from Tarsus to Tyre—(Quinta: Curtius iii. I 3;

relative importance was not so great when it was under a
Western power, like that. of the Seleucids or the Romans ;

Among the rocks and brushwood at the base of Anti—

which, after running a course of no great distance to
the south-east, loses itself in a desert lake. But before
it reaches this dreary boundary, it has distributed its
