ES-SALT. 45 7

bok (p. 45 5), is crossed, and then a wooded ridge beyond
which is a romantic glen with the ruins of ’Alakﬁn above.
Passing on by the ruined villages of Sihan, ’Allan, the village
of Z7? is reached on the summit of the western shoulder of
Mount Gilead. Looking back from this point, there is a
ﬁne view of the Belka heights, and the Wady Z’urka. In
front the prOSpect is very extensive, embracing the Jordan
Valley, the Hills of Judaea, and the mountains of Moab.
Hence the traveller descends to the Castle of Es-Salt.

ES—Salt is the ancient Ramoth Gilead. The city
stands on two sides of a lofty hill crowned by a citadel.
Some of the walls of a more ancient citadel are visible, dating
far back into the Jewish period. There are some ﬁve or six
thousand inhabitants, of whom one-ﬁfth are Christians, with
four pastors of the Greek Church, two of the Latin, and
one of the English.

Besides the conspicuous citadel, there is little in Es-Salt
to notice. An old Mosque in ruins, and some rock grottoes
are of some interest. Here at Ramoth Gilead, Ahab, and
Jehoshaphat fought with Syria, and here Ahab received his
death wound as prophesied by Micaiah, the son of Imlah.
It was here that J ehu was anointed by the prephet, and
entered on his task as the executioner of Divine vengeance
on the house of Ahab. Then as now it was a strong and
well nigh impregnable fortress, and around its walls many of
the most memorable battles of Gilead had been fought.

According to some authorities Ramoth Gilead was iden-
tical with Ramoth Mizpeh, mentioned in Joshua xiii. 26,
“ while again there is every reason to believe it occupied the
Spot on which Jacob had made his covenant with Laban.”
Ramoth Gilead was the “ city of refuge ” for the tribe of
Dan (Deut. iv. 43 ; Josh. xx. 8; xxi. 38). In 2 Kings viii.
'22, and in Chron. xxii. 6, the town is spoken of as Ramah.
