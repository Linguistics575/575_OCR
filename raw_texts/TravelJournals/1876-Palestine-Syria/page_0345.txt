CASTLE OF SUBEIBEH. 325

It was here, or hereabouts, that “on the next day when they
were come down from the hill, much people ‘met Him,” and
He cast out the devil his disciples could not ; here He warned
his disciples of his approaching end; here He “took a little
child and set him in their midst ;" and then, when his work
in this northern limit of his travels was completed, and the
time of his death drew nigh, He set forth to Jerusalem for
the last time. “And it came to pass, when the time was
come that He should be received up, He stedfastly set his
face to go to Jerusalem ” (Luke ix. 51).

Every traveller who has half a day at his disposal should
make an excursion to the Castle of Subeibeh (Kul’at es
Subeibeh). The hill on which it stands is about 2,500 feet
above the sea level, and is a conspicuous object. The ascent
may be made on horseback or on foot, or a combination of
the two, the horses being used only for the level part of the
journey. If the usual track, which the guide will point out,
is traversed, the ascent is by no means difﬁcult ; but if an
attempt be made to scramble over the avalanches of stones-
on the face of the hill, the traveller may regret his under-
taking.

The ruins are very extensive—much more so than could
be imagined when gazing at them from Baniéls ; and in a
careful examination it will be found that they represent the
architecture of every age—from the Phoenician to the seven-
teenth century. The origin and early history of the castle
are unknown. The ediﬁce is about three hundred yards long,
:and a hundred wide at each end. The stones are bevelled,
and the masonry is massive; some of the arches and niches
are curious and rich in their ornamentation. Many Arabic
inscriptions will be found on some of the walls. The best
preserved part of the castle is the south; the most ruinous,
the south-east. The walls enclosing the castle have broken
