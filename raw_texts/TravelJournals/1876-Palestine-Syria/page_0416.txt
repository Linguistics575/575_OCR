chambers like galleries are occasionally seen opening high
up in the wall. Near, and among them also, are tombs,
ranging from twenty to sixty feet in length, with tiers of re-
cesses for bodies on each side. It is a strange, romantic spot,
this Vale of Beit Jibrin. One might Spend days in roaming
through its mysterious caves, which look like subterranean
towns. The remains on the surface, too, are well worth the
attention of the architect. Cy010pean foundations, indicating

to Gerar by the conquering Israelites. Mareshah is men-

Prophet; and in Michah i. I 5, amongst the towns exhorted
to remember the wrath of God against idolatry. On his
march from Hebron to Ashdod (I Mace. v. 65—68), Judas
