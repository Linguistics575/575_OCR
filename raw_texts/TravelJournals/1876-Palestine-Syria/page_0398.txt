that “ Greece itself cannot surpass in grandeur the temples
of Bé'albek and Chalcis. The Pasha of Damascus holds the
whole range under his authority.”—(Ilﬂzitney’s Handbook of
Bible Geography.)
Tripoli,

or Tripolis (from three quarters, Aradus, Sidon, and Tyre
—whence “The Triple City ”), has a p0pulation variously
estimated at 13,000, 17,000, and 24,000. It is built
on both sides the river Kadisha. It abounds in streams
almost as much as does Damascus. There are eighteen
churches in the town, one of which is Protestant. The
chief manufacture is soap, made from olive oil. Tobacco is
cultivated here plentifully; and Sponges are ﬁshed for freely,
and command a good trade. The scenery in the neighbour-
hood is very ﬁne; the antiquities, though not extensive, are
very interesting.

Tripoli is chieﬂy visited by travellers as a starting point
for the Cedars, but it is interesting as a city that has
memorials of many ages, and a history unique, insomuch as‘
it is unknown, but is supposed to date from early Phoenician
times. It is the Alexandria of Syria, for its library of
100,000 volumes, in which there were no doubt MSS. which
would have given its history from Phoenician times, was
destroyed by ﬁre in 1 104.

The Castle is the best place for a good view. The
houses are white-roofed, and many of the interiors are curi-
ous, having wells of water in them. The journey from
Tripoli to Beyrout takes about seventeen hours, and the
traveller passes the picturesque bay {of R38 Shekka, the
antique town of Batrﬁn, dating from the time of Nebuchad-
nezzar, and the town of Jebeil, correSponding with the Gebal
of Scripture, from whence the great stones used in the build-
ing of Solomon's Temple. were brought (1 Kings v. 18).
