origin. One of the large halls, ninety-eight feet by sixty—
nine feet, approached by a portico of eight Corinthian
columns, has been used as a church. The friezes on the
stones of the adjacent hall, of which the pediment has fallen
in ruins, are well worth examination.

A small Temple of Ashtal‘oth, or Astarte, is a little
farther west. It is a ﬁne ruin. The statues in front are
numerous, but, unfortunately, sadly mutilated. A colossal

crescent moon, from which her name of Caaraim, or “ two-

I Kings xi. 5; 2 Kings xxiii. I 3). She was adored in Bashan
from the earliest times. Ashteroth-Kamaim, the long-lost
capital of Bashan, is mentioned in Gen. xiv. 5. '

The remains of the Hippodrome are interesting.

tombs are found in proximity to the town —high square
towers built in stories, with recesses in the sides of the
chambers for the bodies.

roundings are such as to add to the picturesque effect of the
mingled mass of ancient buildings.

In the adjacent glen is a Theatre, with the seats hewn
