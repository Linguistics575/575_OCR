324 BANIAS.

at that grotto, where, perchanoe, in early days Baal was wor—
shipped (p. 322),where, without doubt, the Greeks, who always
associated caves and grottoes with the worship of Pan, paid
their devotions to that deity, he will recall with some emotion
that scene recorded in Matt. xvi. I 3, “ When Jesus came into
the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, He asked his disciples, saying,
Whom do men say that I the Son of man am ? And they
said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist; some, Elias ;.
and others, Jeremias, or one of the prOphets. He saith unto
them, But whom say ye that I am ? And Simon Peter
answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art
thou, Simon Bar-jona: for ﬂesh and blood hath not revealed
it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven. And I say
also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will
build my church ; and the gates of hell shall not prevail
against it.”

Stanley says with reference to this, and to the scene of
the Transﬁguration (Matt. xvii.), Jesus “ came into ‘the
parts,’ unto ‘the villages’ of Caesarea Philippi. It is possible
that He never reached the city itself; but it must at least have
been in its neighbourhood that the confession of Peter was
made. The rock on which the Temple of Augustus stood,
and from which the streams of the Jordan issue, may pos—
sibly have suggested the words which now run round the
dome of St. Peter's. And here one cannot but ask, What
was the ‘ high mountain’ on which, six days from that
time, whilst still in this region, He was transﬁgured before
his three disciples? It is impossible to look up from the
plain to the towering peaks of Hermon, almost the only
mountain which deserves the name in Palestine, and one of
whose ancient titles was derived from this circumstance, and'
not be struck with its appropriateness to the scene.”
