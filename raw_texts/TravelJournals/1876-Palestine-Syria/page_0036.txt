to Jericho, the Jordan, Dead Sea, Mar Saba, Bethlehem,
Solomon’s Pools, Hebron, etc., to Beit Jibr‘in, same as described

from thence taking the following course]:

Eglon. Encamp at Gaza, and if possible spend Sunday there.
Gaza is a considerable city, with schools and other Christian
agencies in operation.

Gad and Ashdod to Askelon, where the camp must rest for
the night.

en route the Jews’ model farm and colony. This tour will
occupy about ﬁfteen days, giving four or ﬁve days to Jeru-

These Itineraries, Nos. 2 and 3, had better not be attempted
in wet weather, as the low lying lands of Philistia are frequently
rendered impassable by storms and ﬂoods.
