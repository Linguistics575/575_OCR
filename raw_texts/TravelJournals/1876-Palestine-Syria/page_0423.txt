in the reign of Ahaz (2. Chron. xxviii. 18).

“We had around us at Bethshemesh,” says the Rev.
J. L. Porter, in The Giant Cities of Bashan, “the native
country of Samson, and from its ruins we could see the
scenes of some of the leading events of his strange life.
Beyond the fertile valley on the north rises a steep hill,
crowned with a Muslim wely and a small village—that is
