and winding-sheet. By the Crusaders, Neby Samwâ€™il was
regarded as the ancient Shiloh (p. 247), and the present
mosque, which was formerly a Latin church, was built by

The distance from here to Jerusalem is a little under
six miles, and will be traversed in less than two hours. The
route descends the hill-side, passes two reservoirs cut in the
rock, and enters the valley of Beit Hanina, with a village
on the left, from which the name of the valley is derived.
Soon after crossing the valley, a steep ascent has to be made ;
the Tombs of the Judges (p. 181) are passed, and in about
twenty minutes Jerusalem comes in view.
