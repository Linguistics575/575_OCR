Bab Kisan is the Christian Cemetery. Buckle, the famous
English historian, lies buried here. A short distance from
the Little Gate (Bab-es-Saghir) is a vast Muslim cemetery,
where three of the wives of Mahomed lie buried, and many
of the great men of the city, warriors and politicians. Here
too is buried the celebrated historian, Ibn ’Asaker. From a
mound in the cemetery the view is remarkable. The Iron
Gate (Bal-el-Hadi'd) is close by the Castle (p. 34.6), and the
Serai, or Palace, now used as barracks. Between the Gates
Bab-el-Hadid and Bab-el-Faraj, where the walls are
washed by the river, is the Saddlers’ Bazaar, and near it is a
mammoth plane tree, over 40 feet in circumference,
with enormous branches 5 it is well worth seeing. The age
of the tree is uncertain. Thomas’ Gate (Bab Tdma),
named after a Crusader who fought so gallantly as to gain
the admiration of the Muslims who slaughtered him, is near
the Protestant Mission (p. 3 50). Houses upon the wall will
be observed near here, and they will illustrate the story of
Rahab, who let down the spies, and of the escape of St. Paul
in a basket (p. 337).

Returning to the East Gate, the traditional House of
Ananias and the House of Naaman will be pointed
out. The latter stands close to a tumble-down mosque.
There is appropriateness in turning this traditional site into a
Leper Hospital. (2 Kings v.)

The extensive Suburb of Meidan consists of a broad,
badly-paved street, about a mile long, wherein a mixed mul-
titude of folk from all the districts round about, and eSpecially
the Hauran, congregate. The mosques here are numerous,
and sadly out of repair. The suburb is less interesting
for its own sake than for the sight of the people who
frequent it.
