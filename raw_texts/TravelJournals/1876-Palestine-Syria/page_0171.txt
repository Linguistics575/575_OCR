ROBINSON’S ARCH.

r 5 r

The fragment consists of immense stones projecting from
the wall near what is now the level of the ground, and it
forms the spring of what he considered to be a Spacious
arch. The wall extends in an unbroken line from the
Wailing Place to the arch, though it cannot be followed
because of the houses which are built up against it; and,
respecting the arch, it is curious to notice that the second
course of the spring contains two stones, which seem to be
two halves, split asunder, of one original stone of enormous
dimensions. Whether Robinson’s conclusion was correct
remained a disPuted point, which the result of the EXplora-
tion has decided in his favour. Captain Warren sunk several
shafts in a line west of this projecting masonry, and came
upon a pier which supported what must have been the west
side of the arch. Beyond all :question, at one period there
must have been a bridge here, connecting the Temple with
the south-west part of the city, and spanning the valley
between. The excavations also disclosed, at a distance of
sixty feet under the present surface of the soil, fragments of
voussoirs, or bevelled stones, lying where they fell, when, by
some means or other unknown, the bridge was destroyed.

The place on which they now lie scattered in confusion,
once formed the level of a street running under the arch—
like the street in Edinburgh under the North Bridge, or that
in London under the new Holbom Viaduct. The exca-
vations also laid open a vast conduit running under this ancient
street, at a further depth of twenty feet; and, what is very
remarkable, brought to light an opening into it, through
which, in all probability, water was once drawn from the
conduit as from a well. Through this opening, water would
be obtained when the bridge was perfect, when people passed
under it to and fro in the days of Herod, for it must have
existed then, if not before.
