Dalmanutha.”

Across the lake, which here attains its greatest width,
namely, six and three-quarter miles, and nearly Opposite to
Magdala, is Khel‘sa (Gergesa) (p. 303). “The site of the
ruins is enclosed by a wall three feet thick. The remains are
not of much importance, with the exception of those of a
large rectangular building lying east and west. On the shore
of the lake are a few ruined buildings, to which the same
name was given by the Bedawin. About a mile south of
this, the hills, which everywhere else on the eastern side are
recessed from a half to three-quarters of a mile from the
water’s edge, approach within forty feet of it. They do not
terminate abruptly, but there is a steep, even slope, which we
would identify with the “ steep place,” down which the herd
of swine ran violently into the sea, and so were choked. A
few yards off is a small intermittent hot spring.

“ That the meeting of our Lord with the two demoniacs
took place on the eastern shore of the lake is plain from
Matt. ix. 1', and it is equally evident, on an examination of
the ground, that there is only one place on that side where
the herd of swine— could have run down a steep place into, the
lake, the place mentioned above. The eastern coast has
since been carefully examined by Mr. MacGregor in his
canoe, and he has come to exactly the same conclusion. A
difficulty has arisen with regard to this locality, in conse-
quence of the different readings in the three G05pels. In
Matthew our Saviour is said to have come into the country
of the Gergesenes; in Luke and John into that of the
Gadarenes. The old MSS. do not give any assistance here 5
but the similarity of the name, Khersa, to that of Gergesa, is,
as Dr. Thomson points out in The Land-and the Book, a
strong reason for believing that the reading of Matthew is
