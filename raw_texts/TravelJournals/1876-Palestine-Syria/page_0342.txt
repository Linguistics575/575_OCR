BAniés was known as the Greek Paneas, from the sanc-
tuary of Pan (p. 324.). It was adorned by Herod the Great,
who erected a temple over the spring of the Jordan, in honour
of Augustus Caesar. His son, Philip the. Tetrarch, enlarged
the town, and called it Caesarea, in honour of Tiberias Caesar,
and, as there was already a Caesarea on the Mediterranean, he

Casarea Paneas, a name which is preserved in the modern
name of BAnias. .

the Mount of Halak that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-
Gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon ”
(Joshua xi. 17). See also xii. 7, xiii. 5.

Baal-Gad is probably identical with Baal-Hermon (Judges
iii. 3; I Chron. v. 23).

The greatest interest which the modern traveller feels in

has been the foundation motto of the Roman Catholic Church
(p. 324) 5 and an unauthentic tradition, but dating from Euse-
bius, has claimed for this spot that it was here Christ healed
the woman having an issue of blood.

The situation of Banias is exceptionally beautiful, being
