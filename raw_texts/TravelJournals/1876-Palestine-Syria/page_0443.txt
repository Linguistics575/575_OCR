Kasimiye'h, a river which ranks next to the Orontes and Jor-
dan, amongst the rivers of Syria. It rises near Ba’albek,
and drains the slopes of Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon, and
probably represents the Leontes of ancient geography. The
deep ravine along which the ,river ﬂows is crossed by a

Besides the principal mass of ruins, consisting of broken
