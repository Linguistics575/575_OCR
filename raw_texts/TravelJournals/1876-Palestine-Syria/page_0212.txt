I 9 2 BETHLEHEM.

there seems no reason to doubt, that on the patrimony of Boaz,
and Jesse, and Chimham, there had been erected, by one of
the heads of the family, in accordance with eastern custom, a
caravanserai or inn, representative of the primitive hospitality
of earlier days; so that when “ Joseph went up from Galilee,
out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of
David, which is called Bethlehem (because he was of the
house and lineage of David), to be taxed with Mary his
espoused wife (Luke ii. 4, 5), he was, in coming to the inn,
not only literally complying with the Roman edict, that every
one should go to his own city, but was probably going to
his own house. For the full working out of this deeply
interesting subject we must refer our readers to the above
mentioned author.

And now there came to pass the wondrous events re-
corded in detail by the Evangelists Matthew and Luke, in
the second chapters of their respective gosPels, and succinctly
summed up by St. John in the statement that, “ The Word was
made ﬂesh and dwelt amongst us.” It is these events which
make Bethlehem a household word wherever Christianity is
professed, and cause the thoughts of millions to be turned
towards this Judaean village, as year by year Christmas-tide
comes round. “ And thou, Bethlehem-Ephratah, though
thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee
shall He come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel ;
whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting "
(Micah v. 2). '

It is in commemoration of the great event thus foretold
by Micah, years before its occurrence, and the kindred
associations linked with that event, that the principal object
of attraction in Bethlehem, about to be described, was
erected.
