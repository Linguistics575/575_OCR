MODERN JERUSALEM.

Most travellers have a feeling of disappointment on ﬁrst
seeing Jerusalem, its magnitude is so much less than the
imagination had pictured. Associated as it is with the
grandest and most sacred events of history, it is difﬁcult to
feel that this little town, around whose walls you may walk
in an hour, is the Holy City. And, indeed, it is not; for
the city whose streets Jesus trod was vastly larger. Then
Zion, a large part of which is now a ploughed ﬁeld, was
covered with palaces; and on every side, where now the hus-
bandman pursues his toil, or desolation reigns, were magni-
ﬁcent structures beﬁtting a great capital.

One is surprised, also to ﬁnd how little remains of the
ancient city. The present walls were built in the sixteenth
century—only a few courses of stone in them belonged to
the ancient walls. Its buildings are all new, except that here
and there a foundation course indicates the ancient period.
The ancient rock crops out in the Temple area, at the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre, and on the brow of Mount Zion. But
the gorgeous City of Solomon lies buried under the débris of
sixteen sieges and captures of Jerusalem. You must dig
from thirty to a hundred feet to ﬁnd it. Jerusalem that was,
is “ on heaps,” “wasted and without inhabitant.” Excavaé
tions have shown that the foundations of the ancient walls
are, in some places, I 30 feet below the surface. In digging
for the foundation of new buildings, the workmen so'me-
times dig through a series of buildings, one above another,
showing that one city has literally been built upon the ruins
