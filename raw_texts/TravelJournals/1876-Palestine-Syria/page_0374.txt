354 DAMASCUS TO BEYROUT.

the ancient chapel, which serve as a centre and framework to
. the prospect and retrospect, still preserve the magniﬁcent
story which, whether truth or ﬁction, is well worthy of this
sublime view. Here, hard by the sacred heights of Sala-
hiyeh—consecrated by the caverns and tombs of a thousand
Mussulman saints—the Prophet is said to have stood, whilst
yet a camel-driver from Mecca, and, after gazing on the
scene below, to have turned away without entering the city.
‘ Man,’ he said, ‘can have but one Paradise, and my Para-
dise is ﬁxed above.’ ”——-(Stanley.)

(3) To Saidna’iya and Helbon is a two days’ journey.
The former is celebrated for its ancient convent erected by
Justinian (2), and a miracle-working image of the Virgin.
Helbon is in a land of vineyards, and possesses a few very
ancient ruins. It is supposed to be the place mentioned by
Ezekiel (xxvii. 18)—“ Damascus was thy merchant in the
multitude of the warns of thy making, for the multitude of ‘
all riches ; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool."

(4) To the Meadow Lakes is an excursion that re-
quires two days for its performance, and is interesting as
giving the best impression of the fertile country round about
Damascus. It is an excursion very rarely taken, and must
never be attempted without a good guide.

DAMASCUS TO BEYROUT DIRECT.

[The diligence starts from the ofﬁce close to Demetri’s
Hotel, and the distance of seventy miles is accomplished
in about 13% hours. It is necessary, in the busy season,
to secure places early, as the accommodation is limited,
and the good seats are few.

Private carriages may be ordered at Damascus—or Beyrout
on the return journey—and these are much more com-

fortable. They hold ﬁve persons]
