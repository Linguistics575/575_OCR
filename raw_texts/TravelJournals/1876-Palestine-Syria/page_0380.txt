360 BA’ALBBK.

Ba’albek is the Heliopolis of the Greeks and Romans,
celebrated for its sun-worship in the temple which was one
of the wonders of the world. There is an inscription in the
grand portico of the temple still existing, which has been
translated thus: “ To the great gods of Heliopolis. For the
safety of the lord Ant. Pius Aug., and of Julia Aug., the
mother of our lord oflthe Castra (and) Senate. A devoted

sun; the female sharer of_ his honours being Ashtoreth, or
Astarte, the moon. Ba’albek means, in the. Arabic lan-
guage, the city, or crowded place cf the sun, and in all pro
bability corresponds with Baal-gad, the troop of the sun,
mentioned more than once in the book of Joshua, with a
clearly-deﬁned topographical position. “ So Joshua took all
that land from the Mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even
unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Her-
mon ” (Josh. xi. 17, xii. 7, xiii. 5). When the Greeks came
into possession of the district, they, according to customary
usage, while holding the fane as a place of. worship, altered
