NAZARETH. 233

Laureta (whence Loreto). A church was erected there, and
round it a village soon gathered, to which Pope Sixtus V.
accorded the privileges of a tovtrn. Half a million pilgrims
resort there annually; in fact, it is one of the most frequented
sanctuaries of Christendom.

The Workshop of Joseph, in the Muslim Quarter of
the town, is in the possession of the Latins. Only a small
portion of the wall is claimed to be the original workshop.
The Table of Christ, where, it is said, he met with His
disciples, and dined both before and after the resurrection,
will also be pointed out, as also the Synagogue, in the
possession of the United Greeks, where He is said to have
taught (p. 281).

One more holy place the traveller may visit, although
he will probably not receive much ediﬁcation by so doing;
it is the Mount of Precipitation, where, it is said, the
people sought to cast our Saviour down (p. 278). It is two
miles from the town, and about as improbable a site as could
have been selected. No one will be at any loss to ﬁnd half-
a-dozen places much nearer the town, answering all the
requirements of the gospel story.

To the minds of most, there are two places in Nazareth
sacred with the holiest associations. The ﬁrst is the Foun-
tain of the Virgin; and the second, the Wély at the top of
the hill behind Nazareth.

The Fountain of the Virgin is a plentiful spring
of water issuing from three months. Above it, the
Orthodox Greeks have their own Special Church of the
Annunciation. The scene at the fountain is always interest-
ing, and especially so in the evening, when it is thoroughly
Eastern. Here the villagemaidens, in their white robes and
bright head-dresses, assemble, and bear away their well-ﬁlled
pitchers on their heads. There can be no reasonable doubt
