ToMBs or THE JUDGES. 181

which one must stoop to enter, and by it is 'a large stone,
which may be rolled so as to close the opening. It reminded
me of a large mill-stone, and would certainly require a good
deal of strength to move it along the groove cut for its
reception. Having entered within the low door, I found
myself in a spacious chamber forming a square, whence
passages led into other square chambers, round which were
numerous deep loculi, with inner and very small chambers
beyond them, or at their side. Turning out of the large
principal antexhamber to the west, and passing through a
second chamber, I ascended a ﬂight of steps which led to a
higher chamber on the north. There lies the broken lid of
a sarcophagus, and a sarcophagus taken frbm this chamber
is now preserved in the Louvre at Paris. I noticed, connected
with the loculi, ledges to support slabs for closing them in,
after the dead should be deposited there. What I have said
as to the architecture of tombs will apply in this instance;
where, though the tombs are true and proper rock tombs,
yet they are externally adorned by architectural work. The
architecture points to Roman times, and it seems pretty clear
that the catacombs bearing the name of the kings, never
could have been prepared for the ancient princes of Judah.
Not here are we to look for the Tomb of David and his
.descendants. Mr. Fergusson considers that they belong to the
time of Herod.”—(Dr. S toughton.)

The opinion is now very generally entertained that this
is the Tomb of Queen Helena of Adiabene, a convert to
Judaism, 48 A.D., and who, according to Josephus, was
buried here.

About a quarter of an hour to the north-west are the
so-called Tombs of the Judges, which have in front
an architectural facade with an ornamental pediment, and in
the angular space beneath is a pedimented doorway.
