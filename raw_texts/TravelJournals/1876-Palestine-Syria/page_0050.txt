32 GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES.

2600 feet. In Judaea the hills are mostly moderate eleva-
tions of barren rock, though their general height above
the sea is from two thousand to three thousand feet. On
the east side they descend abruptly to the great valley of the
Jordan, their general slope being furrowed by steep and
narrow gorges, forming the beds of winter torrents. The
precipitous descent from Jerusalem to Jericho (p. 2 36) is
notorious for its difﬁculty and danger, and may be cited as
an example of the lateral valleys descending towards the
west bank of the Jordan. On the western side, the Judaean
hills slope more gently and gradually, but the passes are
mostly difﬁCnlt. Thus the central heights of Palestine are a
series of strong natural fastnesses. Armies, both in ancient
and modern times, have often traversed the coast from Egypt
to Phoenicia without disturbing the inhabitants of the hill ‘
country. ‘

“ But by far the most remarkable feature of Palestine,”
says the Rev. J. S. Porter in Dr. Kitto's Cyclopedia g“
Biblical Literature, “is the Jordan Valley, which runs
through the land from north to south straight as an arrow.
There is nothing like it in the world. It is a rent or chasm
in the earth’s crust, being everywhere below the level of the
ocean. This deep valley produces a marked effect upon the
ridges which border it. Their sides towards the valley are
far more abrupt than elsewhere in Palestine; the ravines
that descend from them are deeper and wider; and towards
the south, along the shores of the Dead Sea, there is a look
of rugged grandeur and desolation such as is seldom met
with. The valley is of nearly uniform breadth, about ten
miles from brow to brow, exPanding slightly at Tiberias and
the Dead Sea, as if greater breadth had made some enlarge-
ment of the lateral boundaries necessary. This valley forms
a very striking feature on every map of Palestine.”
