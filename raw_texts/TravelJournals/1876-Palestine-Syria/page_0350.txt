our left. A lofty plain, named Merj-el-Hadr, is crossed,
and a wild glen with a noisy stream is entered; then down,
sometimes past oases of beauty in wildernesses of desolation,
until a halt is made in a rocky valley near Beit Jenn. A
pleasant road beside the brook, called at this part Jenani, and
afterwards, when united with another tributary, the Pharpar.
After about forty minutes’ ride, we enter a large plain, With
