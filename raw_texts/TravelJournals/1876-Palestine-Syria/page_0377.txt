’AIN FIJEH. 357

and Ashrafiyeh are two villages, connected by a rock
tunnel, supposed to have been made by Zenobia, to conduct
the water from ’Ain F ijeh to Palmyra, or what is more feasible,
it may have been a channel for water to Damascus. A glen
is now entered, so exquisite that the traveller, coming from
the sterility of Palestine, ﬁnds himself in a new world. The
river dashes at his feet, and upon the banks, which it waters,
life and beauty, in luxuriant profusion, strike one in contrast
to the desolation and death around. Every variety of fruit-
tree is seen, the walnut predominating, and groves, and
orchards make glad this strange and solitary place. Passing
the village of F ijeh, we arrive in about ﬁve minutes at the

Fountain Of F’ﬁeh (’Ain Fijeh), the principal source
of the Abana. There is an old temple, in ruins, above the
Spring, and at its base there is a cave. From this there
rushes up———not a mere fountain—but a full-grown river,
which dashes and splashes over rocks and stones for about
eighty yards, and then joins another and much smaller branch
of the Barada, and the two, thus joined together, make one ,
river, which the Arabs of to-day call Barada, and the ancients
called Abana. One sympathizes here with the saying of
N aaman, “ Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus,
better than all the waters of Israel? ” (2 Kings v. 12.).

The Ruins are probably those of a temple, dedicated to
the god of the river, and are of very ancient date. It is,,
however, a matter of pure conjecture when, or why, or
by whom, the temple was built.

’Ain Fijeh is a capital place at which to camp (p. 3 56),
but if this is not in accordance with the traveller’s programme,
he should at least Spend an hour or so in its vicinity. Pro-
ceeding on our journey, we pass over ledges of rock and
steep embankments, ﬁrst this side of the river, and then that,
sometimes through green ﬁelds, and then by chalky passes,
