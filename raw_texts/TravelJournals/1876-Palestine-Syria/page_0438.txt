Megiddo, and capture of Jerusalem by N ebuchadnezzar,
doubtless seemed to the onlookers of Tyre and Sidon only .

harbour to the north was blocked up by the Cyprians, and
that to the south by his Phoenician allies, and thus he was
able to unite the island to the mainland by an enormous
artiﬁcial mole, to construct which the ruins of Old Tyre
were thrown into the sea.

misfortunes and recovered its greatness and commerce. And
when we reﬂect that Alexander utterly destroyed it, burning
it to the ground, mercilessly putting to the sword all who
resisted, and hanging two thousand of the principal citizens
along the sea-shore,” and selling thirty thousand inhabitants
