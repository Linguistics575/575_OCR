393 GAZA TO JERUSALEM.

A road running northwest from Beit Jibrin leads past
Dhikrin, and Deir Dubbﬁn (Convent of the Fly), with
its numerous labyrinthine caverns, to Tell—eS-Sﬁﬂeh,
which is adapted as the site of Gath Dr. Thomson in-
clines to make Beit Jibr’in the site of Gath, but most
authorities unite with Mr. Porter in selecting Tell-es-Séﬁeh
as the right place.

The hill, or Tell, is about two hundred feet in height,
vineyards in terraces partly clothe the sides. At the top are
the foundations of the old castle built here by the Crusaders,
who called the hill Blanche-garde. In this vicinity many
notable exploits of Omar de Lion were performed. The
houses of the village which now stands on the north-eastern
shoulder are composed of the materials taken from old ruins.
Fragments ‘of columns and other scattered remains lie
around.

Gath means “ a wine-press.” It was one of the ﬁve
chief Philistine cities mentioned in Joshua-xi. 22, as one of
the cities in which the Anakim—those ﬁerce men of great '
stature—still dwelt. In Joshua xiii. 3, I Samuel vi. I7,
Amos vi. 2, Micah i. 10, the place is mentioned as a repre-
sentative Philistine city. But Gath is no doubt especially
associated in every mind with the terrible champion “ whose
height was six cubits and a span,” who came forth from the
city to defy the armies of Israel (I Samuel xvii. 4.). Other
members of this giant’s family are mentioned in I Chron. xx.
5—8. To Goliath, however, there will be occasion again to
refer presently.

In I Samuel v. we ﬁnd the ark of God brought to Gath,
where Ashdod had suﬁ'ered'from its presence, and upon the
Gittites being similarly punished, the ark was again removed
to Ekron.
