until we reach Si‘lk Wady Barada, a charming spot,
and one often selected as a camping-place, as it stands in the
midst of orchards, close beside the river, and with exquisite
scenery all around. Sﬁk Wady Barada is identical with the
ancient city of Abila (probably the same as Abel). It is
referred to—or rather the district around it——-in St. Luke’s
Gospel, iii. I, “Now in the ﬁfteenth year of the reign of
Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being Governor of Judaea,
and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip
tetrarch of Iturae and of the region of Trachonitis, and
Lysanias the tetrarch g" Abilene." Josephus makes mention
of the place, but its history is not easily connected. Ly-

the territory passed to Philip the tetrarch to Agrippa, and
then to Herod Agrippa.

Abila was in Christian times a bishop’s see, and was
sacked by the Muslims, A.D. 6 34.

the August, the Lord of Armenia, and Imperial Caesar Lucius
Aurelius Verus, the August, the Lord of Armenia, restored
this road, which had been torn away by the violence of the
river, by the instrumentality of Julius Verus, Legate of the
Province of Syria, who was also their own friend, at the
expense of the people of Abilene.”

Perched on the top of a high hill is the so-called Tomb
Of Abel; (Kabr Habil) it is a Muslim Wely, and is thirty
feet long. This is also the supposed site of his murder.
There are a few other ruins in the immediate neigbourhood.

Our course now lies through the glen of the Barada until
we reach the Plain Of Zebedany about three miles in
breadth, surrounded with mountains. The plain is richly
