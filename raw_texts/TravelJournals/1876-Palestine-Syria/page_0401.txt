JAFFA T0 ASCALON AND GAZA. 33;

Jafla are left behind is rather dreary, chieﬂy over sandy
tracts, until, on crossing some elevated ground, the plains of
Philistia are seen, gracefully undulating, and richly clothed
with pastures and growing crops.

“ The most striking and characteristic feature of Philistia
is its immense plain of corn-ﬁelds, stretching from the
edge of the sandy tract right upto the very wall of the hills
of Judah, which look down its whole length from north to

‘ went down ’ into the plain. Through these same openings,
after the fall of Goliath, the Philistines poured back and ﬂed
to the gates of Ekron, and through these the milch—kine,
lowing as they went, carried back the ark to the hills of
Judah (1 Sam. xvii. 52, vi. 12). In the caves which pierce
