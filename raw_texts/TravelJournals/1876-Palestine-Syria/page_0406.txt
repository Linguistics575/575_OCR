386 f JAFFA TO ASCALON AND GAZA.

‘ Blanche Garde ’ of the Crusading chroniclers, which wit-
nessed his chief adventures.”

The Syrian Venus referred to in this extract was the
Fish-goddess, Derceto, the tutelary deity of Ascalon.

“ No ruins can be more complete than those of Askelon.
It is an utter desolation. Great fragments of the wall that
faced the sea lie scattered about like immense boulders, the
stones and the mortar bound together in a solid mass. One
is at a loss to conjecture what mighty forces could have been
employed to wrench such massive blocks from a wall that
seems to have been part of the rock itself.

“We clambered over these fallen masses, which will
soon be buried in the drifting sand, and reached the highest
part of the old battlements. Seating ourselves on a project-
ing column, we surveyed this scene of awful desolation. On
our way up we passed several marble and granite pillars,
beautifully polished, and bearing testimony to the taste with
which the city was adorned. Fragments of marble and
granite lie scattered about in all directions. Patches of
garden ground, onion-beds, hedges of prickly-pear, mounds
of débris, now occupy the site of Askelon. There is not one
inhabited house amongst the ruins—not so much as the
vestige of a modern house. The ﬁne crescent sweep of the
ancient city is ﬁlled up with sand 5 . . . towards the north-
east are beautiful gardens, ﬁlled with fruit-trees, ﬂowers,
and vegetables. Every now and again in the narrow lanes,
we came upon broken columns of marble and ‘ granite, and
- ornamented friezes, which had been dug out of the sand-
drift. It is a remarkable fact that not a single column stands
upright. At a little distance from the walls is a small village,
where pieces of broken pillars are now used for door—steps.
Many portions of the ruins have also been drifted into the
adjoining gardens.”—(Wallace.)
