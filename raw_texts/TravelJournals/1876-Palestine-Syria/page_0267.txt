SHILOH. 247

yards and orchards, and still bearing everywhere the signs of
the blessing of Ephraim (Dent. xxxiii. 14., I 5). To the
left is the village of ”ﬁn Yebrild, one of the most fertile
spots in the fertile land of Ephraim, but the road to it is a
hard one to travel.

By and by we see Jifna, and ’Ain Sinia, and then the
village of Yebrﬁd. One or two ruins are passed, one of
them called the Kasr-el-Berdawil, supposed to mean the
Castle of Baldwin. We are now in an exquisite valley, or
glen, called the WadY-el-Haramiyeh (i.e., Glen of the
Robbers). It is usual to camp for the night at Sinj’il, some
little distance further on; when, however, any obstacle
arises to prevent this, a good camping place is at ’Ain-el-
Haram‘iyeh, the Robbers’ Fountain, where the water is
remarkably good, the scenery exceedingly picturesque, but
the reputation of the place had to the last‘degree, as its
name implies. Leaving the glen with its caverns and
cisterns, and profusion of ferns where the water drips
down the cliff, the traveller enters on a more open valley,
which is as romantic as any in Palestine, and soon arrives
at Sinj i1. .

In order to visit Shiloh the road to the right must be
taken; the direct road to Nﬁbulus, however, is to the north
of the plain, above which Sinjil is situated.

Shiloh, Arabic Seilﬂn, is now one large heap of ruins,
and the ﬁrst thought of the traveller, as he beholds the
large mound covered with masses of débris, huge stones,
and pieces of broken column, will be the singularly graphic
fulﬁlment of the prophecy of Jeremiah, who used it as a
type of the destruction which should fall upon the house of
the Lord in Jerusalem. “ Go ye now unto my place which
was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the ﬁrst, and see
what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.
