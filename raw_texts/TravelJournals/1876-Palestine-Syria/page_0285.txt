SAMARIA. 265

a very picturesque ruin. It was a Christian church, but has
now become a mosque. There are traces of a nave with
two aisles. On the walls are crosses of the Knights of
St. John. In the, centre of an open court, there is a dome
over the traditional sepulchre of St. John the Baptist. In
order to enter the tomb, a number of steps have to be
descended, and here is pointed out the tomb of the Baptist,
the tomb of Obadiah, besides one or two others. There is
also shown a massive stone door, four feet high, said to be
the actual door of St. John’s prison. It will be remembered
that Josephus states that John was beheaded in the castle of
Machaerus, on the Dead Sea (p. 220). St. Jerome is the
ﬁrst writer who refers to the tradition that St. John was
buried here. The 'tomb is called by the Arabs Neby
Yahya.

The Colonnade, or “ Street of the Columns," many of
which are monoliths, running round the hill side, will pro-
bably present to the majority of travellers greater interest than
anything else to be seen in Samaria. “The remains of the
ancient city Consist mainly of colonnades, which certainly
date back to the time of the Herods, and perhaps many
of the columns are much older. . . . . The grand
colonnade runs along the south side of the hill, down a
broad terrace, which descends rapidly towards the present
village. The number of columns, whole or broken, along
this line, is nearly one hundred, and many others lie scattered
about on lower terraces. They are of various sizes, and quite
irregularly arranged, but when perfect it must have been a
splendid colonnade. The entire hill is covered with rubbish,
indicating the existence and repeated destruction of a large
city.”—(Tlle Land and the Book.)
