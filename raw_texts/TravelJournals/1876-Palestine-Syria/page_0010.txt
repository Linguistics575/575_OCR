printed book, and of having to carry a guide-book in one
hand and a Bible in the other. The Editor, has, therefore,
endeavoured to incorporate into this Handbook not merely
the references to the passages of Scripture descriptive of
places of interest, but the words of the sacred text also.

Others regret their inability to carry with them a stock
of books; but apart from the inconvenience of their heavy
freight, there is the impossibility to ﬁnd time for much
reading. And yet, who would not like to refresh his
memory with some glowing passages from Stanley or Robin-
son, or to know exactly the manner in which Captain
Warren or Captain Wilson has expressed in scientiﬁc lan-
guage the true description of certain remarkable sites?

The Editor has endeavoured to supply this want by
adding to his own personal observations and the contribu-
tions 'specially prepared for this work, by travellers who are
his personal friends, extracts from the copious literature of
the Holy Land in the words of eminent writers who have
contributed valuable and reliable information, and have made
the study of sacred geography so deservedly popular.

The Editor will be grateful for any information derived
from the personal observations of Tourists which may
serve to correct errors or supply deﬁciencies in this Hand-
book ; such communications to be addressed, “Editor of the
Tourists’ Handbooks,, Messrs. Cook and Son, Ludgate
Circus, E.C.” ‘
