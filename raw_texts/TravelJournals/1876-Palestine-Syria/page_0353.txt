[Travellers in Damascus who wish to wander about in
the city after dark must be careful to carry a lantern; if
found without one, they will ﬁnd themselves under arrest,
and ﬁnd the position unpleasant into the bargain. These
lanterns are simple contrivances, not unlike the Chinese lan-
terns used for Christmas trees. If the traveller ﬁnds his
progress after dusk interrupted by a closed gate, he must
shout, “ Ifta ya Hdris! ” i.e., “ Open, 0 watchman,” and give
a triﬂing fee. Here, as elsewhere, a fee will cover almost
every diﬂiculty.] -

Damascus is the oldest city in the world (Josephus
makes it even older than Abraham—Ant. i. 63). For the
traditions of the events in the infancy of the human race,
which are supposed to have happened in its vicinity, see
Pococke ii. 1 15, 1 16. The story that the murder of Abel took
place here is alluded to by ShakSpeare (1. King Henry VI.

To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt.
