286 NAZARETH TO TIBERIAS.

right the path descends, and the traveller passes through a
wilderness of stunted oaks and shrubs, which reach almost
to the base of Tabor. To the right will be seen the village
of Debﬁ rich, the ancient Daberath (uncertain), a town of
Zebulun (Joshua xix. 11), or. of Issachar (xxi. .28). It was
allotted to the Gershonite Levites ( t Chron. vi. 72). The
ruins here consist of the bare walls of a church, and founda-
tions of some structure of a much earlier date.

The ascent of Tabor is by no means diﬂicult, the path
winding in easy zig-zags to the summit.

Mount Tabor stood on the frontier of Zebulun and
N aphtah Among Greek and Roman writers it was called
Itabyrion, and Atabyrion, its modern name is ,Jebel-et-Tﬁr.
It is a beautiful hill, somewhat in the shape of a sugar-loaf,
ﬂattened at the top; it stands alone on the plain, except
where a narrow, and in some places imperceptible, ridge
unites it to the hills of Galilee; its height from the plain is
about I 3 50 feet, and from the sea level over 2000 feet. It is
a graceful and beautiful object from any, and every point of
view, and presents various striking contrasts, when seen in
different aspects. On the southern side, for example, it is
rough and rugged, with nothing but barren limestone visible;
northward it is covered with thick foliage, oak, terebinth, and
syringa ornamenting it from base to summit; elsewhere it
presents the appearance of a series of well-planted terraces.
It should be seen under various lights, and from different
points of view. The history of Mount Tabor may be brieﬂy
summarised. It was here that Deborah commanded Barak
to gather his army, “ and Barak went down from Mount ,
Tabor, and ten thousand men after him. And the Lord dis-
comﬁted Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with
the edge of the sword before Barak ” (Judges iv. 14., 15).

Tabor is referred to in the wars of Gideon (Judges viii.
