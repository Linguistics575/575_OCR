the yellow desert, and around it are the bare mountains, with
the snowy crest of Hermon, standing like a sentinel with
shining helmet, on the west—“ the tower of Lebanon which
looketh toward Damascus.”-——(7. D. B.) V

The Biblical Allusions to Damascus are very nume-
rous. After the reference to it in the time of Abraham (Gen.
xiv. I 5) (p. 3 34), the next reliable notice is found in 2 Sam.
viii. 5. “When the Syrians of Damascus came to succour
Hadadezer, king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and
twenty thousand men. Then David put garrisons in Syria of
Damascus, and the Syrians became servants to David." For an
account of the battles between the kings of Judah and Israel,
and the kings of Damascus, see I Chron. xviii. 5, 6, 2 Kings

3—5 5 Jer. xlix. 23—27. In the New Testament, it will be
remembered that St. Paul was converted on his way hither
(p. 3 30), and that when “the governor under Aretas the
king, kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison”
(2 Cor. xi. 32, 33), sought to apprehend Paul, he was let
down in a basket through a window and escaped his hands.

1, 2). During the residence of Paul here “ he preached
Christ in the synagogues that He is the Son of God
and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving
that this is very Christ” (Acts ix. 20—22). Christianity
ﬂourished here so extensively that in the time of Constantine
