place (1 Sam. xvii.), he thence goes forth to see his brothers
with the army, and slays the giant champion of Philistia, as
recorded in the same chapter.

There were other members of the family of Jesse who
attained to celebrity, and displayed the ﬁghting character of
the Bethlehemite in all their actions. These were Joab,
Abishai, and Asahel, the sons of David’s sister Zeruiah, and

peace and war, of captivity and restoration, there was a con-

their ancestral lands on the hill of Bethlehem. And more,
