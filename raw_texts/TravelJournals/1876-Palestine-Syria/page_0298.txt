273 SAMARIA T0 NAZARETH.

sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods
ascending out of the earth. And he said unto her, What
form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up ; and
he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it
was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground,
and bowed himself” (1 Sam. xxviii. 11—14). Then
followed the pr0phecy of Samuel, declaring his death on
the marrow, on hearing which, the terriﬁed, and conscience-
stricken man swooned away.

The traveller will now return by the same road to
Shunem, if he has a party to join there, or if not will strike
across the plain direct to Nazareth (p. 279).

 

Leaving Shunem, we descend into the plain, and have
before us Mount Tabor (p. 286), which may be ascended
now, or, if time permit, an excursion may easily be made to
'it from Nazareth, or it can be visited on .the road from
Nazareth to Tiberias (p. 285), this latter route is not, how-
ever, recommended, as in that case Kefr Kenna, the supposed
Cana of Galilee, will have to be omitted. .

As we approach the high hill, on which Nazareth
stands, we notice the village of Iksal, supposed to be Chis-
loth-Tabor (ﬂank of Tabor), on the boundary of Zebulun-
(Joshua xix. 12.). Where the rocks are barren, and pre-
cipitous, a worthless tradition has given the name Mount of
Precipitation, alleging that it was from here the people of
Nazareth sought to cast the Saviour down headlong (p’. 283).
Now commences a sharp ascent, through glens and gullies,
over steep and rugged places, where the well-tried Syrian
horses pick their way with marvellous sagacity, and at
length the town of Nazareth is seen, and is entered in about.
twenty minutes after sighting it. ~’
