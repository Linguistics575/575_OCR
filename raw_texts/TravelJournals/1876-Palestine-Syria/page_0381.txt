the name which Alexander gave to the city of On, in Egypt.
In the ﬁfth century, Macrobius states, “that the image wor-

which, by its colossal genius, has earned the name of

to excess, its ﬂuted columns, and a rich profusion of decora-
tion; and a Temple of the Sun, the remains of which clearly
indicate its former grandeur. A peristyle led to a vast
hexagon surrounded by niches and columns; a large square
