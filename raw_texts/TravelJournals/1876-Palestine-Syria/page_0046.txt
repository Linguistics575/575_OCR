23 INTRODUCTORY.

TO make this tour, a fortnight would have to be added to a
Palestine tour which would include Damascus.

TOURS TO PALMYRA

can be made from Damascus in twelve days for the double
journey. But Palmyra is under the power of .rapacious sheikhs,
and great care has to be observed in arranging for a tour to that
city of grand ruins.
