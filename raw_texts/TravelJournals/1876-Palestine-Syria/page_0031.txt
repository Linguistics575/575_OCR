ROUTES TO THE EAST. 13

From other parts of Northern Italy the Alps can be crossed,
so as to return by Bavaria or Switzerland and the Rhine, or
other deviations from the beaten track can be provided for if
desired.

The ROUTE FOR SHORT TOURS to Lower Egypt and two or
three weeks in Palestine, is usually from London to Turin, as
described above, then to Genoa and take steamer there for
Alexandria, calling at Leghorn, Naples and Messina. Proceed
through Lower Egypt to Ismailia and Port Said, and thence to
Jaﬁ'a. Return from Jaﬁ'a, or Caifa, to Alexandria, and then to
Naples, and by railway to Rome, Florence, Bologna, Turin, or

is the cheapest and most popular route to Palestine. But this
can be modiﬁed, extended, or abridged in many ways. It
can be reversed through Italy, and other lines of steamers can
be taken from French or Italian ports. In all cases of personally-
conducted tours it is necessary to deﬁne the route the conductor
will take, and those who keep with him will fare the best, as all
baggage, omnibus and other incidental charges are paid by him ;
but if any leave him it is not possible to control these expenses,
and the travellers must then take their own course and pay the
extras. Tickets can be provided for travelling by any line of
railway or steamboat.

from both Liverpool and Glasgow they have connection with the
best railroad service of the United Kingdom. They can offer to
American travellers Pullman cars by day or night, or the best
class of select compartment-carriages.

If Americans wish to go to the East by the Western Route,
tickets can be issued either by San Francisco, Japan, China and ~
