' MOUNT HERMON. 327

Palestine. It was the great landmark for the northern
border of the Israelites, and it rises about ten thousand feet
above the level of the sea. There are three separate heights
which form the summit, and they are raised two or three
thousand feet above the main chain. The loftiest peak is on
the north; the second height is three hundred yards to the
south of the highest one; beneath it, about ﬁve thousand feet
from the summit, are the highest sources of the Pharpar.
The third height is about a quarter of a mile to the west, and
is separated from the two former by a small valley. The
views from the summit are, of course, very extensive and

the Buka’a, and the ranges of Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon.
The great eastern plain is well stretched out before the second
or southern height; and from the third or Western peak a
great part of Syria is seen. Far away to the south are the
mountains of ’Ajlﬁn, stretching towards Moab ; and we can
follow with the eye the course of the Jordan, with the lakes
of Tiberias and Hﬁleh, the mountains of Gilead on the one
side, and those of Samaria on the other. On the west lie
Samaria and Galilee, reaching to Carmel,‘ which is seen,
together with Tyre and the Mediterranean. Beyond Tyre
rises the range of Lebanon, which prevents our seeing
further north. We see Anti-Libanus and the plain of
Damascus, which extends as far as the “ Meadow Lakes ”
to the north-west. To the south of this limit rise con-
spicuously to view the complete chain of the Hauran.
Round 3 rock which forms the Crest of the second peak,
there remain the foundations of a circular wall, composed of
large stones; and within the enclosure are heaps of well-
shaped stones, which must have at one time formed part of
a building; bevelling and moulding are still to be seen.
There is also a fragment of a column; and the form of a
