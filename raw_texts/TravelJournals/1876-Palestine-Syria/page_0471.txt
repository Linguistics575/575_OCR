NEBO. 45 I

it was denounced by the prophets, “ Heshbon shall cry ”
(Isaiah xv. 4; see also Jeremiah xlviii. a, 34., 45).

“There is little, of a ‘place once famed ion olden story,
for 'the traveller to see. A large piece of walling at the
west end of the bold isolated hill, on which the old fortress
stood; with a square block-house, and a pointing arch-
way adjoining; a temple on the crest of a hill, with the
pavement unbroken and the bases of four columns still in
situ ; on the east, in the plain, just at the base of the bill, a
great cistern, called by some the' ‘ﬁsh-pools of Heshbon,’
but more probably only the reservoir for the supply of the
city—these are all that remain.”—-(Tristram.)

From Heshbon a visit is paid to Mount, Nebo, the scene
of the death of Moses. Main, anciently Baal-Moon, is
passed on route. This is the Spot where Balak stood with
the prophet Balaam, and urged the latter to curse the
, Israelites (see Numbers xxii., xxiii., xxv.)

The febal Neda, in the mountain range of Abarim, is,
doubtless, the ancient Mount Nebo. Dr. Tristram, whose
admirable work, The Land of Moab, will have been studied
by every traveller who takes this journey, says-—

“ Anxious to verify exactly the view of Moses, we paid
three visits to'Nebo 5 but we were not so fortunate as on
my former visit, when, for the ﬁrst time,‘Nebo was identiﬁed.
On each occasion there was a haze from the heat, which
dimmed the distant features and outlines, producing a sort of
mirage, which rendered it almost difﬁcult clearly to trace
distant objects. Still we had a clear distant view of Western
Palestine and the whole Judaean range, from far south of
Hebron up to Galilee. We could see the west side of the
Dead Sea from Engedi northwards,Bethlehem, Jerusalem, and
Neby-Samwil (Mizpeh). Ebal and Gerizim were very easily
made out, and the opening of the vale of Shechem. Carmel
