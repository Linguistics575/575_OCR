1 78 JERUSALEM.

“ Jesus went over the Brook Kidron with his disciples,
where there was a garden into the which He entered " (Matt.
xxvi. 36 ; Mark xiv. 32.).

A writer, who looks upon this as the veritable scene of
the agony and betrayal,—an Opinion which is shared by
many eminent travellers and writers,—says : “ Over there in
Jerusalem His body was cruciﬁed; but here was the scene
of the cruciﬁxion of His soul. There the letter of the law.
was executed, but here the awful weight of its Spirit was
borne. There He drank the dregs of sorrow, but here the
‘full cup’ was wrung out to Him. Here the enemy who
had departed from Him for a season, returned with all the
. powers of hell to overthrow the Son of Man. Here his
‘ own familiar friend ’ betrayed Him. Here the Captain 'of
our Salvation was made perfect through suffering, and from
this place, broken hearted as He was, with the Cross before
Him, and a heavier cross upon Him, He rose up from the
garden and went forth to die. ‘ Take off thy shoes from off
thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy
ground.’ ”

In the bed of the Kidron, north of the road, is the

Tomb of the Virgin.

A handsome ﬂight of forty-seven steps leads to the church,
which, according to some traditions was erected by St.
Helena. The whole place, which belongs now to the
Greeks, is full of legends, and many sacred spots once here,
have been transferred elsewhere, and vice versa. Here
are the Tombs of Joachim and Anna, the parents of the
Virgin (p. 163), the Tomb of Joseph, the husband of the
Virgin, the Tomb of Mary, and the Grotto of the Agony
(p. 177). Here, too, are praying-places, oraltars, for Greeks,
Armenians, Abyssinians, and Muslims.
