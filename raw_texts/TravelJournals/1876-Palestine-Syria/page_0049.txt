GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES. 31

stretch inland for miles from the low sandy coast. Acre
(p.414) stands on the shore, and the Belus and the Kishon ﬂow
across the plain to the sea. Beyond the Kishon the plain is
broken by the bold ridge of Mount Carmel approaching very
near to the sea, but allowing a good road round its base. The
portion of the plain traversed by the Kishon is the Plain
of Esdraelon, the great battle-ﬁeld of Jewish History.

South of Carmel the great plain opens out and stretches
away to Gaza. As far as Jaﬂ'a it is the Plain of Sharon,
south of that town it is Philistia. A broad belt of sand forms
the border of this plain along the shore. This sand is year
by year advancing on the cultivated land, and nothing seems
able to stay its progress. In some places the sand has raised
hills two hundred feet in height, and at Gaza the belt is four
miles in width. The plain is mostly bleak and uncultivated,
except the rich orchards and groves round Jaffa and a few
other places, and the abundant corn-ﬁelds in a portion of
Philistia. Innumerable Wédies, or beds of mountain tor-
rents, cross the plain, which varies in width from about eight
miles at Caesarea to twelve at Jaﬁ'a and twenty at Gaza.

The central range of mountains running from Lebanon
southward through Palestine, is intersected in the middle by
the Plain of Esdraelon. The northern portion of this range
consists of the Hills of Galilee. The ridges of Gilboa and
Little Hermon traverse the Esdraelon plain, which is also
overlooked by Mount Tabor (1800 feet).

South of the Plain of Esdraelon stretches an unbroken
tract of mountains, about thirty miles in breadth, and rising
in height towards the south, till near Hebron it attains an
elevation of three thousand feet above the sea. The north-
ern part of this . region comprised Samaria and Southern
Judaea. The principal mountains of Samaria are Ebal and
Gerizim, rising to the height respectively of 2700 and
