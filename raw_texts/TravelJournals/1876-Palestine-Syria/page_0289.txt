JEZREEL. 269

and destroyed the increase of the earth . . . for they came
up' with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grass-
hoppers for multitude (Judges vi. 1—6). It was held for a
long time by the Philistines, who had a fortress at Beth-
shean (1 Sam. xxix., xxxi.), and the Syrians frequently swept
through the plain with their armies (I Kings xx. 26).

From Jenin to Haifa, Acre, and Mount Carmel, takes
about thirteen hours.

As we proceed on our journey towards Nazareth, the
different points of interest will be more particularly men-
tioned.

There is a direct caravan route across the plain, but it is
exceedingly uninteresting. We shall therefore take the route
which combines the most interest.
