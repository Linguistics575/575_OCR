298 SEA or GALILEE.

From Tiberias to Tell—Hﬁm.

There are two ways by which the journey may be made :
either by boat (p. 297), or by road. The latter is the more
usual, but the former, although taking a longer time, is the
more interesting, as the views on either side are better seen
from the water. Moreover, the heat by the road-way is very
oppressive, and on the water what breeze there may be, is
caught. Of course if the weather is rough, a boat should not
be taken ; but as arrangements such as these are generally left

boat proceeds.

The road or the lake present of course the same features,
and the places passed occur in either case, in the following
order :—.-Almost opposite T iberias are Wady F ik, and the
ruins of Gamala (p. 460), where once stood a fortress, garri-
soned by Josephus, and taken in 11.1). 69 by Vespasian with a

the precipices. On the left are some Springs, known as ’Ain-
el-Bérideh, then on the left again is seen the village of
Mej del, corresponding with Magdala, where Mary Mag-
dalene was born. It is a wretched village now, with only
twenty huts. Below it is a small plain, and with this the
traveller will associate the passage in Matt. xv. 39, where,
after recording the miracle of the loaves and ﬁshes, it is said
Jesus “sent away the multitude, and took ship and came into
the coast of Magdala.” Probably a village named Dal-
manutha adjoined Magdala, as in the corre3ponding passage
in Mark viii. 10, it says, “Straightway He entered into a
