From many causes. Sometimes from local
disturbing agencies, such as sickness; some-
times from neglect in cleansing; but more
frequently from decay in the saps and tissues
r , which supply each individual hair. In such

‘ OLDRIDGE’S

BALM OF COLUMBIA

Is an excellent corrective of the many insidious sources of decay which
ruin nature’s chief ornament.

Are alike beneﬁted. For children it is invaluable, as it forms the bmis
of a magniﬁcent Head of Hair, prevents Baldness in mature age, and
obviates the use of dyes and poisonous reatoratives.
