highest point of Lebanon. Limestone composes the main
part of the mountain. The loftiest peak, which is an obtuse
truncated cone, is quite destitute of trees and verdure, and
the snow never disappears from its summit. In spring and
summer it is thickly covered, but as the year advances it
partially melts, and has a streaked appearance, and at last
only a few white lines, until the winter again, early in
November, gives it the great white dome. The mountain is
covered in places with soft chalk, and in the southern spurs,
near Hasbeyﬁ,_basalt is found. A ravine on the north side
divides Hermon from Anti-Libanus. Bears (Ursus Syriacus)
are to be found on Mount Hermon, very much like the
common brown bear. Game abounds, too, and foxes and
wolves are found on the slopes. ‘

blossoms abound. For an account of the ﬂora and vegeta-
tion of the mountain, see p. 52.. The vine is cultivated on
its slapes, and several wild fruits are found high up; and on
the western slape, at no less a height than over ﬁve thousand
feet, the almond-tree ﬂourishes to such an extent that this
part has received the name Akabet el L621 (Almond Moun-
tain). Vegetation gradually ceases towards the top, and near
the snowy‘ crown nothing but the Ranunculus demisus is
found—(L. H.) ‘

series of further ascents are made, while the head of Hermon,
