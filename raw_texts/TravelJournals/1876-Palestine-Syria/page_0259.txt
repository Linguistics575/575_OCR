MI CHMASH. 239

'up to the opposite ridge, and the modern village of El Hizmeh
will be seen. A green and pleasant valley stretching at our feet
is crossed, and then, ascending another hill, we reach Jeb’a,
the ancient Geba of Benjamin, which, like Anathoth, was
a priestly icity (Joshua xviii. 24). It was for some time in the
possession of the Philistines, but Jonathan took it from them.
Notwithstanding this, the Philistines soon gathered together
again at Michmash (p. 240) (1 Sam. xiii.), and the Israelites,
under Saul, took up their position at Geba, the deep ravine
called the Passage Of Michmash separating the two
armies. The traveller should read the whole story in I Sam.
xiii. and xiv. 5 how Jonathan started out with his armour-bearer,
and the people knew not that he was gone. “ And between
the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the
Philistines’ garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side,
and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the
one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. The fore-
front of the one was situate northward over against Mich-
mash, and the other southward over against Geba.” To the
garrison Jonathan went, “ and the Philistines said, Behold,
, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they have
hid themselves.” Jonathan, undaunted, “ climbed up upon
his hands and upon his feet, ancLhis armour-bearer after him,
and ”—even as Horatius kept the bridge—“ they fell before
Jonathan, and his armour-bearer slew after him. And that

ﬁrst slaughter, which Jonathan and his armour-bearer made,
' was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of
land. . . And there was trembling in the host, in the
ﬁeld, and among all the peeple.” The noise that was in the
host of the Philistines reached the ears of Saul while he was
consulting with the high-priest. All Israel went forward to
the battle, and the Philistines were driven before the
Israelites, and did not attack them again until in that battle
