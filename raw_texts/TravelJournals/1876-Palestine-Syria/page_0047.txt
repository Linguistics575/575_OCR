G EOGRAPH ICAL FEATU RES.

SYRIA is that mountainous province of the Turkish Empire
lying to the east of the Mediterranean Sea and including
Palestine or the Holy Land.

The name Palestine (Heb. Pelesheth) to the ancient
Hebrews only meant Philistia, and it was from their early
acquaintance with this part of the country that the Greeks
gave its designation to the whole laud. At various epochs,
the country has been called by various names.

The Land of Palestine, as in Joel iii. 4, Exod. xv. r4,
Isa. xiv. 29, 3I, always in the Bible means Philistia.

Canaan is the oldest name of the country, and owes its
origin to the son of Ham, whose descendants settled in the
land (Gen. ix. 18, x. 15—19).

The Land of Promise, used once in the New Tes-
tament, is a term which has become familiarized by writers
on prophecy, etc.

The Land of Jehovah (Hosea ix. 3).

The Land of Israel ﬁrst occurs in 1 Sam. xiii. 19, and
is most frequently used by Ezekiel.

Judaea, or Judah, originally meant the territory of
Judah. After solomou’s death it meant the southern king-
dom. When the northern kingdom went into captivity and
did not return, Judaaa became equivalent to the Jewish
Nation, z'.e., all Palestine. The Romans applied the term
only to the southern province.
