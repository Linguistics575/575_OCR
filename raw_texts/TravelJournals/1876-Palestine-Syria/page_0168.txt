In 1839 Sir Moses Monteﬁore was permitted to visit the
mosque, and Miss Barclay, the daughter of the celebrated
American missionary, at a much more recent date, was
allowed to sketch the tomb. She says, “ The tomb is
apparently an immense sarc0phagus of rough stone, and is
covered by green satin tapestry, richly embroidered with

Christians ; in another is a praying-place for Muslims. On
the wall which separates the Coenaculum from the Tomb
