HISTORY. ‘ . 39

Antioch, on the Euphrates. Antiochus the Great was
now king of this country; many Jews had been attracted
to new cities built in the Syrian dominion by special privi-
leges similar to those granted in Egypt. Antiochus seeing
Egypt ruled by an infant determined to add Palestine to his
dominion; he succeeded, and the Jews welcomed his rule.

Antiochus visited Jerusalem, conﬁrmed old privileges
and conferred fresh ones, repaired the Temple, and otherwise
conciliated his new subjects. For a time, under Antiochus
and his successor Seleucus Philopator, the country enjoyed
comparative rest. .

During this period Greek literature, and manners, and
' religion largely inﬂuenced the Jews. Many were ready to
renounce all the characteristics of Judaism, others were
zealous for the ancient faith, disputes arose between the
parties, especially when Hellenized Jews, like Jason or
Menelaus bought the High Priesthood from Antiochus
Epiphanes,‘and then sent gifts to the Tyrian Hercules, or
sold the Sacred Vessels from Zion. Antiochus, returning in
169 3.0. chagrined from an unsuccessful exPedition, chose
to consider one of these faction struggles as a revolt. He
gave up the city of Jerusalem to his soldiers for three days,
slew 4000, sold as many more, riﬂed the Temple of its
treasure, and offered up a hog on the altar.

In the following year Antiochus, in attacking Egypt,
came in contact with Roman power, and was commanded
to retreat 5 bafﬂed and enraged, he wreaked his spite against
the Jews. He sent Appollonius with an army to Jerusalem,
multitudes were slain, 10,000 taken captive, the city plun-
dered and set on ﬁre, its walls destroyed, and entrance into
the Temple prevented by a Syrian garrison. It was conse-
quently in June, 168 3.0., that the daily sacriﬁces of the
Temple ceased, and the City of Jerusalem became deserted.
