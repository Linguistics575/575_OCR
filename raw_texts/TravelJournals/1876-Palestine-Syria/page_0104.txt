86 JAFF A TO JERUSALEM.

much pleasanter one. It was Kuryet-el-‘Enab, or the
Town of Grapes; and this is comparatively a recent name ‘
for it, as in the far away ages it was Kirjath-Jearim, the'
City of Woods. (The identiﬁcation was made by Robin-
son.) ‘

Kirjath—jearim was one of the four cities of the Gibeon-
ites (Joshua ix. 1 7) ,on the north boundary of Judah (xv. 9),
and the southern one of Benjamin (xviii. I4, I 5). Urijah,
the prophet, was born here (Jer. xxvi. 20). After the exile
this was one of the ancient cities again inhabited (Ezra ii.
25, Neh. vii. 25).

The principal event narrated in Scripture about Kirjath-
jearim will be remembered with interest here.

The ark of God was at Bethshemesh (p. 402). “And
the men of Kirjath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of i
the Lord, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the
hill, and sanctiﬁed Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the
Lord. And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath—
jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years:
and all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord ” (1 Sam.
vii. I, 2). At the end of that time, “ David gathered all Israel
together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of
Hemath to bring the ark of God to Kirjath-jearim ” (1
Chron. xiii. 5). The traveller may perhaps realize the
scene as he approaches the village, and settles in his mind
some house “in the bill” as the starting place. Never
was there such a day in the picturesque village before. It
was the beginning of Israel’s glory. No wonder there-
fore that, “ David and all Israel played before God with all
their might, with singing and with harps, and with psalteries
and cymbals and trumpets.” Perhaps as the vast procession
moved down the steep hill the refrain of this song might
have been heard :—
