303 SEA or GALILEE.

On rising ground at the back of these ruins are the
remains of the ancient town of Capernaum, where our Lord
had His own house. These ruins occupy a space half a mile
long by a quarter of a mile broad. It has been supposed that
a main street can be traced, leading to Chorazin.

As there is no harbour at Capernaum (Tell-Hum),
it is assumed that boats have been kept at Et-Tabigah
(P- 3°5)- -

Chorazin (Kerdzeh). Two and a half miles north of
Tell-Hum (one hour’s journey) are the ruins which Pococke,
as early as the year 1740, identiﬁed, from the similarity of
the name Gerasi, with Chorazin. They cover an area equal
in extent to those of Capemaum, and comprise the remains
of a synagogue with Corinthian capitals in black basalt,
dwelling-houses, a building with Ionic capitals, etc. Traces
have also been discovered of the paved road which connected
Chorazin with the great caravan road to Damascus.

The tourist will notice a ﬁne large tree beside a spring of
water, and near it two tombs of Bedouin sheikhs, overhung
with coloured rags.

At least a day or two should be Spent in this, the most
delightful place in Palestine. It is pleasant for the traveller
who has been wearied with holy places in all kinds of im-
probable grottoes and churches, to feel that here he can, with-
out interruption or annoyance, tread in the very footprints of
the Master. And there is much to interest him if he is
slightly wearied with travel, and requires a little rest. For
at ’Ain-et-Tin he will ﬁnd exquisite maiden-hair ferns to
collect as souvenirs, and on the shore there are small shells
innumerable, which are always acceptable to friends at home
as mementoes of this sacred locality. Moreover, the Bath-
ing in the Bay of Et-Tabigah is as good, or better, than any
other bathing in Palestine; and Fishing may be indulged
