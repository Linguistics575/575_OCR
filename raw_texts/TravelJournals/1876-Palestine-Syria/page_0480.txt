4.60 TOURS EAST OF THE JORDAN.

destroyed by the Jews, and subsequently a Christian city.
The ruins are extensive, but contain nothing of Special
interest. From Pella a six hours' journey brings the traveller
to Um Keis.

Umkeis is the modern name of Gadara, whose his-
tory is similar to that of Pella, ﬁrst being heard of in connec-
tion with the victories of Antiochus. Vespasian burnt the
town, and massacred the inhabitants. The city rose again
and became the seat of a Christian bishopric. The present
remains include one or two theatres, a cathedral, well paved
streets, and numerous tombs.

Kul’at—el-Husn is the ancient Gamala, a strong fortress
conSpicuous in the Wars of the Jews. Agrippa spent seven
months in a vain attempt to capture it. Vespasian took it
in 69 A.D., and put the garrison to the sword. Four thou-
sand were slain, and ﬁve thousand more perished by throwing
themselves from the walls on to the rocks below.

Bethsaida (which must not be confounded with
Bethsaida of Galilee) is on a hill overlooking the eastern
shore of Lake Gennesaret. It was originally a village, but
was rebuilt and adorned by Philip the Tetrarch, who named
it Julias, after an Imperial Princess of Rome. It was in a
“ desert place” near this town that the ﬁve thousand were
fed by our Saviour (Luke ix. 10—17). A blind man had his
sight restored to him at Bethsaida (Mark viii. 22—26).

For route hence to Tiberias, and general description of
the Lake of Gennesaret and its coasts, see pp. 293-307.
