I 16 JERUSALEM.

pied by the Haram-esh-Sherif 5 the remaining Space is
divided into different quarters, the Christian Quarter-—
including the part occupied by the Armenians—taking up
the western half 5 the Mahomedans have the north—east
portion, the Jews the south-east. The whole p0pulation is
now about 16,000.* The circumference is very nearly two
and a quarter miles, while the extent of the city (small as it
is, it now seems too large for the population) may be illus-
trated by the fact that it would nearly occupy the Space
included between Oxford Street and Piccadilly on the north‘
and south,‘and Park Lane and Bond Street on the east and
west.”—-(Our FVOrJz in Palestine, p. 28.)

Jerusalem stands on a bald mountain ridge, surrounded
by limestone hills—glaringly white. It is enclosed by
Walls averaging about thirty-ﬁve feet in height, and,
although massive in appearance, far from being substantial.
Around the walls are thirty-four towers, and in the
walls are seven gates, ﬁve open and two closed. The open
gates are—

(1.) The J aﬁ‘a Gate, called by the Arabs Bdb-el-‘Khalil
—-Gate of Hebron, or “ The Friend ”—on the west. It leads
to Hebron. _

(2.) The Damascus Gate, called Bdb-el-‘Amz’ld, 'or
Gate of the Columns, on the north between the two ridges of
the city, and leading to Samaria and Damascus.

(3.) The Gate of the Tribes, Bdbel-Asbdt, or, according
to the Franks, .St. Stephen’s Gate, the reputed site of
the stoning of Stephen (p. 179), leading to Olivet and
Bethany.

(4.) The Dung Gate, or the Gate of the Western
Africans, Bdl'-el-Mughdribelb, leading to Silwan (Siloam).
