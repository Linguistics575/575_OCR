216 BETHLEHEM TO THE DEAD SEA.

Tomb of John of Damascus, an eighth century theo-
logian, of great repute in the Greek Church. The Monks’
Quarter, not over clean and very plain, are at the back of
the church. There are about seventy monks at present in
the Convent. Their principal occupation appears to be the
manufacture of souuenirs for travellers, and their principal

On the south-western side of the monastery is the Cave
of St. Saba, where the saint ﬁrst took up his abode when
the place was more desolate than it is now. A legend says
that the cave was at that time inhabited by a lion, and that
the saint and the lion lived together for a while, but the
latter not having those gifts and graces which would make
him a suitable companion for long, the saint bade him leave,
and he left accordingly.

Every traveller should journey through the labyrinth of
lanes, alleys, etc. ., in order to get different points of view,
and especially to look down from the turrets into the awful
ravine of the Kidron.

FROM MAR SABA TO THE DEAD SEA.

chasm, that a feeling of unsafety is generally experienced,
although the road is perfectly safe.

It is an easy ride of about three hours from the Con-
vent of Mar Saba, up the Valley of the Kidron, to
Jerusalem.
