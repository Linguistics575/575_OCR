SIDON. 42 7

“ Once truly ‘the Great Sidon ’ (Joshua xi. 8) once
furnishing architects such as no other city could furnish
(1 Kings v. 6), once the ‘replenisher’ of even luxurious

other trees of smaller growth, and then looking out upon the
wide sea and the port, we ask the question, ‘ Why can-
not the people revive and gather strength, and make these
advantages tributary to their prosperity? Where are their
helpers? Are there none to remove these rocks and obstruc-
tions, these ‘bonds and yokes’ (Jer. xxvii. 2, 3). And
