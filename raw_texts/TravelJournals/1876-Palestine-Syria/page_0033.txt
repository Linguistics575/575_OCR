TRIPS TO THE PYRAMIDS

constitute a feature of all Tours to Egypt. Personally-Con-
ducted Tours always include a full week in Lower Egypt,

with special arrangements for carriage trip to the Pyramids of
Ghizeh.

TOUR TO THE GREAT DESERT AND
PALESTINE.

The general route is from Egypt to Sinai, Petra, Mount Hor,
and Palestine.

Forty days are required for the journey from Cairo to Sinai,
Petra, and by Mount Hor, to Hebron and Jerusalem. Without
attempting here to mark out the various routes that may be taken,
or to deﬁne exact itineraries, it may be said generally and brieﬂy
that all necessary camp equipments for Tours through the desert
can be supplied; and in every engagement of this kind none but
the most trustworthy dragomans will be employed, who will
do justice to the travellers as well as to the ﬁrm of Messrs.
COOK & SON. A graduated scale of charges according to the
number included in party is adopted, and engagements can be
made for Desert travelling at nearly as cheap a rate as for
Palestine. But the details and conditions of such tours are
best settled by private negotiation (p. to).

For full particulars as to Tours 1n Egypt, with Itineraries of
the Nile Journey to the First and Second Cataracts, see Intro-
ductory Chapter to Cook’: T ourz'sts’ Handéook for E gypt, the
Nile, and Me Desert.
