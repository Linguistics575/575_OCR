443 THE HAURAN.

From Busrah to Der’a by Glu‘isam is a journey of about
seven hours and a half. Der’a is the Adrahah of the
Romans, an important station on their military road from
Bostra to Gadara. Except the remains of what is supposed
to have been a cathedral, there is little of Special interest
in the ruins. An ancient bridge of ﬁve arches crosses the
stream in the Wady-ed-Dan.

Two hours north-west of Der’a lies Mezarib, a village
with a Castle, where the Governor of the Hauran resides.
Mezarib is a station on the Syrian pilgrimage route from
Damascus to Medina. A fair is held here annually,
on the arrival of the pilgrims. Passing the exclusively
Muslim town of Eshmiskz'n, the traveller soon arrives at
Edhr'a.

Edhr'a is the ancient Edrei; a natural fastness, on a
projection of the Lejah, from thirty to ﬁfty feet above the
adjacent plain. The ruins are three miles in circuit, and,
from their prominent position and wild surroundings, present
a very imposing aspect. The massive houses already de-
scribed are plentiful, and there are abundant heaps of the
ruins of larger ediﬁces. The three principal remains are the
Church of St. Elias, a quadrangular structure, with
Cloisters and numerous columns and arches, which appears
to have been successively a Forum, 3 Cathedral, and a
Mosque; and the Church of St. George, founded, as
an inscription states, by the conversion of a Pagan temple
in 516 A.D. In the adjacent plain, 0g, King of Bashan,
was slain in battle by the Israelites (Numb. xxi. 33—35;
Deut. iii. 1—4.). .

Skirting the Lejab, and passing Shukrah, numerous
villages are seen on the plain to the left, and amongst
the rocks on the right, and the traveller next arrives at
Mujeidel.
