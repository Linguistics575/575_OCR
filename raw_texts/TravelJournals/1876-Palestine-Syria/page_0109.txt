THE BETH-HORONS. 9;

Jimzﬁ is the ancient Gimzo (place fertile in sycamores).
It was captured by the Philistines with Ajalon and other
places in the reign of Abaz (2. Chron. xviii. 18) ; it is
situated on the spur of the hills of Judea, and stands “ like
a fortress above the lower bills, as if to defend the passes
beyond."

From Jimzﬁ the path to the left is followed, and soon
“ the hill country of Judah ” is entered. The ascent is long
(about 2} hours) and somewhat tedious as the road is rough,
although not rougher than that from Ramleh to Jerusalem
(p. 80). At the top of the hill there is a village, Umm

of Beit ’Ur-el-Tahta(Beth-Horon the Nether). An hour
of steep up-hill work brings the traveller to Beit ’Ur-el-
F6ka (Beth-Horon the Upper).

These two sites occuPy an important place in Biblical
history and geography. They formed the boundary between
Judah and Benjamin (Joshua xvi. 3, 5, xviii. I 3, I4), and
they are referred to over and over again in the Scripture
narrative; they are chieﬂy famous, however, as the scene of
one of Joshua’s greatest battles. The account of the battle is
so admirably given by Stanley that we insert here an extract
sufﬁcient for the traveller to follow the main incidents of the
story recorded in the Scriptures. If the traveller will make
his way to the Sheikh’s House in Upper Beth-Horon
and take his stand on the roof, he will read Joshua x.,
and then the admirable commentary given below. -It must
be remembered that the route comprehended in this tour
includes El-Jib (Gibeon) and Neby Samw’il (Mizpe/z),
from both which places incidents of the battle will be recalled
with interest.

“The summons of the Gibeonites to Joshua was as
urgent as words can describe, and gives the key-note to the
