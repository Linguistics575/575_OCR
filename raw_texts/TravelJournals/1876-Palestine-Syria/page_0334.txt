314 TIBERIAS TO BANLAS.

Leaving Safed in a north-westerly direction, we pass the
fountain Zeitun, where there is a good View of Safed, then
we see on the right the village of Delata. As we proceed
on the journey, we pass several unimportant villages, and
several valleys which have no historical signiﬁcation, till we
come by a series of ascents on to some table-land, where the
view is extensive and interesting. Here the dragoman will
point out to the traveller a curious Algerian Settlement; the
Lake Hﬁleh (p. 317), the Valley of the Jordan, and ruins in
various places which have not been identiﬁed. One hill,
which by a slight détour the traveller may visit, has been
identiﬁed as the site of the ancient city of Hazor. It has,
however, like most of the historical sites hereabouts, been a

the most suitable place for the development of that power.
As it is by no means certain where the site of Hazor is, its
history may as well come here. It was a city of the
Canaanites, by whom it was fortiﬁed prior to its occupation
by the Israelites of the tribe of 'Naphtali (Joshua xix. 36).
That it was in the neighbourhood of Kedesh and the Lake
Hﬁleh is gathered from the narrative'in Joshua xi. and xii. 19.
When Jabin, King of Hazor, heard of the overwhelming
victories of Joshua, he gathered together the kings of the '
surrounding neighbourhoods, “ and they went out, they and
all their hosts with them, much peeple, even as the sand that
is upon the sea-shore in multitude, with horses and chariots
very many.” , Joshua was victorious; and he “took Hazor,
and smote the king thereof with the sword, for Hazor be-
Ioretime was the head of all those kingdoms; . . . and he
