1 5° JERUSALEM.

established in 1867. For an account of the law relating to
Lepers, see Levit. xiii.

From a Watch tower a short distance from the Lepers’
Quarter, there is a celebrated View which will give the
traveller the best idea of the former positions of buildings,
public places, and general outlines, than from any other spot.
He will see the whole of the Mount of Olives, the valley of
Jehoshaphat, and the Kidron, separating Olivet from the
city; the vallies of Gihon and Hinnom running into the
Kidron, north of En-Rogal. South of Hinnom the Hill of
Evil Counsel, with a modern house on the top, and a tree
just beyond, on which it is said that Judas hanged himself
(p. 166), and, immediately below, the Tyropaeon, or Cheese-
mongers’ Valley, the subject of acres of paper and rivers of
ink (see below).

Following the course of the South wall, and descending
towards the Cheesemongers’ Valley, we reach a small gate
in the south wall, called the Dung Gate (Neh. iii. I 5).
A pathway leads from here to Siloarn (p. 167) ; the modern
name of the . gate is Bﬁb-el-Mugbaribeh, or Gate of the
Western Africans. Passing through a jungle of cactus we
reach the south-west wall of the Haram, where we see some
of the colossal blocks of stone used in the building of that
wonderful structure. In the corner is a stone seventy-ﬁve
feet above the foundation, thirty-eight feet four inches long,
and three and a-half feet high, and seven feet wide. Captain
Warren sunk a shaft at this corner, to the foundation of the
wall. A few steps north, and we see the celebrated Spring
of the arch which connected the Temple with the city of
Zion. It is called Robinson’s Arch, after the name of
the great American traveller who discovered and described
it, and rendered immense service in the elucidation of Scrip-
ture by his Biblical researches.
