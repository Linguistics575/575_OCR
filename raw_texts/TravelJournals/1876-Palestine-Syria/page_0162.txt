I 42 JERUSALEM.

however, much more reason to suppose that it corresponds
with the Gate Shushan, referred to in the Talmud. If so,
“on it was portrayed the city Shushan. Through it one could
see the High Priest who burnt the heifer, and his assistants
going out to the Mount of Olives.” There appear to have
been steps on arches leading down from this gate into
the Kidron towards the east, and leading up again past the
southern end of the present Garden of Gethsemane. It was
through this gate, according to tradition, that our Saviour
entered Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. It is now walled up,
a tradition being extant that, when the Saviour returns to
earth a second time, it will be through this gate He will
make his triumphant entry into Jerusalem, and wrest it
from the Muslims.

Continuing by the east wall, a small Mosque is seen,
called The Throne of Solomon. It was here, says a
legend, that King Solomon was found dead. Looking
westward, near the northern wall, is a small chapel, with a
white dome, marking the spot where Solomon gave thanks
upon the completion of the Temple. By going out of the
gate at the north-east corner of the Haram, about half way
between it and St. Stephen’s Gate (p. 179) may be seen
through a breach in the wall the traditional Pool of
Bethesda (p. 155).

There are a great many other objects of interest that will
be pointed out to the traveller as he makes the tour of the
Haram.

Various Prayer Niches, to which marvellous legends
are attached. The foundations of a wall, probably belonging
to the Fortress of Antonia. The most beautiful struc-
ture in all Jerusalem is probably the Kubbet es Silsileh, or
Dome of the Chain, said to have been the model for the
Mosque of Omar, It is also called the Tribunal of David.
