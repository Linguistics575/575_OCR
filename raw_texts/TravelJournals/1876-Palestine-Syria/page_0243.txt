THE DEAD SEA. 223

merged plains, an elevated and a depressed one—the former
averaging thirteen, the latter about thirteen hundred feet
below the surface. Through the northern and largest and
deepest one in a line corresponding with the bed of the
Jordan, is a ravine which again seems to correspond with the
Wady-el-Jeib, or ravine within a ravine at the south end of
the sea. Between the Jabbok and this sea we unexPectedly
found a sudden break-down in the bed of the Jordan. If
there be a similar break-down in the watercourses to the
south of the sea, accompanied with like volcanic characters,
there can scarce be a "doubt that the whole Ghor has sunk

which abounded in the plain.”

to have seen the remains of Lot's wife. From the extra-
ordinary nature of the salt-hills, many pillars of salt may be
seen there to this day. In Num. xxxiv. 2, 12, the sea is
made one of the borders of the land, and the eastern boundary
of Judah (Joshua xv. 1—5). In Back. xlvii. 6—12, there is
