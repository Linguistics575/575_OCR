26 INTRODUCTORY.

12TH DAY.-—Jericho to Jerusalem by the road already de-
scribed (p. 16). Deducting the two days allowed for the journey
from Jaffa tO Jerusalem, this tour to Moab will be accomplished
in ten days Of actual travel, taking the circuitous route from
Jerusalem to Mar Saba and the Dead Sea. A longer route is
given in the

TENTH ITINERARY.
A MORE EXTENDED TOUR EAST OF THE JORDAN.

Taking the course described in the Ninth Itinerary as far as’

Jerash, would require eight days of travel from Jaffa, or six
days from Jerusalem, from which point we will take our cal-
culations, and begin on the

7TH DAY.-——From Jerash to Wédy Yabis (J abesh Gilead),
w’a Sﬁf, a journey of seven hours.

8TH DAY.—From Wédy Yabis to Um Keis (Gadara), w'a
Pella, seven hours.

9TH DAY.-——From Um Keis to Bethsaida of the Desert, m'a
E1 Husn (Gamala), seven hours.

10TH DAY.——From Bethsaida Of the Desert tO Tiberias, via
the Jordan, Chorazin, Bethsaida Of Galilee, Capernaum, and
Plain Of Genessaret, seven and a-half hours.

IITH DAY.—-From Tiberias to Safed, by the Mount of
Beatitudes, Beth-Arbel and Wédy Hamman (Valley of the
Pigeons), eight hours.

12TH DAY.—-From Safed to Més-el-Jebel, 'z/z'a Hazor and
Kadesh—Naphtali, seven and a-half hours. ’

I 3TH DAY.—From Més-el-Jebel to Baniés (Caesarea Phi-
lippi), w’a Beth-Rehob and Dan, about six hours.

From Bdniés to Damascus, the route has been already de-
scribed in a journey Of two days, halting for a night at. Kefr
Hauwar (p. ). Three days more from Damascus to Ba’albek;
and two days from Ba’albek tO Beyrout. The foregoing is a
tour Of twenty days of actual travel from Jerusalem, but with
necessary stOppages such a tour ought to have forty days allotted
to it, though with hard work it might be got over in thirty days.
