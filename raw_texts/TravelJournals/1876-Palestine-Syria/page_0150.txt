Calvary, it would not have been a thousand times better to
have left it as the bare rock in the Temple: has been left;
strikingly signiﬁcant in the beauty of its simplicity. To the
south is a small Chapel which we can see through a window.
It is the Chapel of St'. Mary, said to bathe spot where
the mother of our Lord, and the beloved disciple, stood at
the time of the Cruciﬁxion, when one of the most touchingly
pathetic incidents in the gospel history occurred: “ Now
there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his
mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary
Magdalene. When Jesus therefore saw' his mother, and
the disciple standing by, whom He loved, He saith unto His
mother, Woman, behold thy son! Then saith He to the '
disciple, Behold thy mother ! And from that hour that
disciple took her unto his own home " (John xix. 25—27).

Opposite this window, on a column in the centre of the
chapel, is a good painting of the Virgin and Child.

Descending now the stairs at the south-west end near
the great door of the church, we turn to the right and enter
a chapel under the Chapel of the Cruciﬁxion, where used
to be the Tombs of Godfrey de Bouillon and
Baldwin I. In the eastern end there is an altar standing
over—it is alleged—the Tomb of Melchizedek. The
Rent in the Rook, which we saw in the Chapel of
Golgotha, could also be seen from here by moving the brass
which covers it. Latterly, however, a door has been placed
here which can only be opened for backsheesh, and an addi-
tional inspiration for paying it is that a tradition has recently
sprung up that the Tombs of Adam and Eve are just behind
the closed door.

In order to visit the Church of the Armenians
from this chapel, we turn to the west a few paces, past the
Stone of Unction, and, behind the Station of Mary, is a ﬂight
