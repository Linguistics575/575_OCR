return to inhabit the ruins. But upon their raising a
rebellion under Bar-chochebas, against Hadrian, the latter
expelled them all, and building palaces, temples, a theatre,
etc., transformed it into a Roman city, under the name of
fElia Capitolina. A temple was erected on Mount Moriah
to Jupiter Capitolinus.

Constantine and his mother Helena transtrmed it into
a Christian city. Julian gave permission to the Jews to
rebuild the Temple, but they could not accomplish it. In
the year 614. they came in great numbers with the Persian
king Chosroes, destroyed the churches, and massacred the
Christians. The Emperor Heraclius afterwards occupied it,
but in the year 637 it surrendered to the Khalif Omar, and
became a Mahomedan sacred city, the Mosque of Omar
taking the place of the Jewish and pagan temples on Mount
Moriah. ’

In 1076 Jerusalem fell into the hands of the Turks, who
practised such outrageous barbarities upon the Christians that
the indignation of all Christendom was roused. The ﬁrst
Crusade was organized, and in 1097 the Christian host,
commanded by Godfrey de Bouillon, entered Palestine. One
by one the chief towns were taken. After two years, Jeru-
salem itself was besieged and captured, the garrison and
inhabitants massacred, and the Crusaders attained the end
of their laborious warfare in the possession of the Holy
Sepulchre. Godfrey was elected King of Jerusalem, and
was succeeded by his relations and descendants until the
year 1187, when the reigning king, Guy de Lusignan, was
taken prisoner in a desperate battle with the Saracen Emir
Saladin, and the city fell again into the power of the Muslims.
Saladin erected strong fortiﬁcations around it, but these were
afterwards demolished.
