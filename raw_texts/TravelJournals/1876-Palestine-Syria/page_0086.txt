68 JAFFA.

Ephraim, which boasts of having Hebron, Zion, Bethel, and
Gerizim for its most eminent and holy peaks.”

Landing at Jaﬁ'a. If the traveller has come from
Egypt and has landed at Alexandria, he will know how to
act when he arrives at Jaffa. If he has not, he is hereby
advised tO keep himself perfectly cool and unperturbed
by the noise and bustle, the gesticulations, and the patent
frauds which will surround him. If travelling under the
auspices of -Messrs. COOK 8: SON, he will merely have to
ask for their representative, and station himself beside his
own personal luggage and see that nobody runs away with it.
Messrs. COOK 8: SON’s boatmeu will be recognized by the
name on their jackets. If travelling independently, let him
have some French or English money in his pocket (not
Egyptian) 5 let him associate himself with two or three
others, and get into one of the swarm of boats around the
vessel -. The fare ought not to exceed six francs for the party,
except in bad weather, when from two to three shillings for
each passenger is scarcely an equivalent for the risk and labour
of landing. If this sum has been agreed upon, he may rest
assured that he will be asked double before he lands 5 but the
only course is to turn a deaf ear to all solicitations of the kind.

Landing at Jaffa is at all times rather unpleasant, and
sometimes a little bit dangerous, as the boats are all rocking
by the side of the vessel, and there are awkward waves tO
encounter before foot is set on terra ﬁ‘rma. Travellers are
advised to place themselves implicitly in the hands of those
who arrange for their debarcation, and however portly the
traveller may be, he will do well to trust himself to the
strong arms Of those who assist him. When the boat
journey is over he will be carried ashore, and will then
proceed to the Custom House, where all luggage is examined.

If the weather be rough; landing at Jaffa is impossible,
