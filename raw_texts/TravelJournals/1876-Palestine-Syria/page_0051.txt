GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES. 3 3

The Jordan, which ﬂows along the valley is described as
the only important river of Palestine. Its sources are
mainly on the southern and western slopes of Mount
Hermon. Its various feeders unite and form Lake Merom,
now Lake Hﬁleh, from which the river ﬂows for a short
distance, turbid and sluggish. After depositing its mud on
a rocky bed, it rushes through a narrow valley of volcanic
origin, and reaches the Lake of Gennesaret, thirteen miles
from Merom. The level of the Lake of Gennesaret or
Tiberias, or Sea of Galilee, is between six hundred and
seven hundred feet lower than that of the Mediterranean.
Leaving the lake at its southern extremity, the Jordan next
passes along a valley of varying width; the river descends
twenty-seven rapids, and in consequence of its constant
winding. traverses two hundred miles in a course of sixty
miles in direct length. It ﬁnally enters the Dead Sea at a
level of about thirteen hundred feet below that of the Medi-
terranean. The other rivers of Palestine are mostly mountain
torrents, only ﬂowing for a part of the year. The Kishon
is only in constant ﬂow for the last seven miles of its
course. ‘

East of the Jordan lies the belt of table-land which
bounds the eastern prospect from any point in Judaea,
Samaria, or Galilee. Its elevation above the level of the
Jordan is from three thousand to four thousand feet. This
is the district anciently known as Gilead, with Bashan to
the north, and Moab to the south. It was called by the
Romans the province of Perea.

To the north of Palestine are two great mountain chains,
Libanus and Anti-Libanus, usually comprehended by the
Jews under the one name of Lebanon. Between these moun-
tains lies the valley of CoeIe-Syria, where stand the ruins of
Ba’albek, and the ancient Palmyra. Here ﬂow the Orontes
