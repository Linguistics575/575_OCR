FLORA. ' 53

montanum, tulip, fritillaria, common berberry, and Daphne
oleoides grow mostly above the height of 4000 feet. Several
species of fern, and a very large number of plants of all sorts,
are to be found in the valley of the Leontes. The ﬁne ever-
green oak-tree of Libbeiya must be noticed, between Has-
beiya and Raskeiya. The oak, ash, cypress, pine, juniper,
and cedar grow to various elevations on the slopes of the
mountains, and the dwarf cherry Cerasus prostrata at a great
height.

A few additional words must be given to the description;
of those trees which take a prominent position among the
natural features of Palestine.

The Olive, so interesting from sacred associations, and
so valuable as forming in large measure the wealth of the
country, produces only poor and worthless fruit in its wild
state, and to make a wild olive-tree proﬁtable, its natural
branches must be cut oﬂ‘, and a graft from a good tree in-
serted. All the branches above this graft will bear good
fruit. (A graft from a wild olive tree is never grafted into a
good tree 5 such a process would be “contrary to nature,”
see Rom. xi. 24.) The olive-tree may also be pr0pagated by
cuttings or by natural shoots. It attains a fruit-bearing
maturity in ten years, and often lives for ﬁve centuries or
more (tradition says that the ancient trees on Olivet were
there prior to the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus), so that
the trunk, in which the formation of fresh wood continually
replaces the decay of age, attains an enormous size. It is
not uncommon to see three, four, or more stems spring-
ing from one root. Nevertheless it is a sensitive tree,
subject to severe injuries from cold, and from a blight pro-
duced by the poison of a small insect, which often causes
the fruit to fall when yet unripe, and unﬁt for the production
of the best oil. Its grotesquely-twisted stems, misty greyish-
