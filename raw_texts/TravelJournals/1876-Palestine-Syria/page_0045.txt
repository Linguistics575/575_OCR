ITINERARIES OF TOURS. 27

These tours to the East of the Jordan would require the
special protection of the local sheikhs, and would involve costs
for this protection varying in amount in proportion to the
numbers of the parties. This would have to be arranged by
special contract at the time, as no ﬁxed charges can be satis-
factorily arranged (p. 10).
