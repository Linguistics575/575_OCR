dragon. Nahr—el-Kelb (Dog River) rises in the Sann’in,
and is so named from a tradition that when a foe approached,
a dog, hewn in the rock, gave an alarm by barking. It was
thrown into the sea, but by whom is not apparent, and a
rock is still pointed out as “the Dog.” The great interest
of this Spot is not, however, so much the river, or the bold
promontory which forms its southern bank, as the nine
Sculptures cut in the face of the rock. Before reaching
them, an inscription will be seen, from which it is ascertained
that the rocky pass was cut by order of the Emperor Marcus
Aurelius Antoninus, who is here designated Germanicus,
and thus ﬁxes the date when the road was constructed as
between the years 176 and 180 A.D. The sculptures, nine
in number, are three Egyptian and six Assyrian. One of
the former is dedicated to Phthah, the god of Memphis ;
another to Ra, the Sun god 5 the third records certain eXpe-
ditions of Sesostris (Rameses II.) The Assyrian sculptures
are regarded as the work of Sennacherib, who invaded Syria,
701 no. Much discussion has taken place with reference
to the origin and history of these sculptures, and for fuller
information the traVeller is referred to the works of M. de
Saulcy, Lepsius, Robinson, Layard, and others.

There is a small Arabian Café here, and a day may be
most pleasantly spent in this neighbourhood. There are
other excursions from Beyrout:—I. To Deir el-Kal’é,
where there is a monastery 2,200 ft. above the sea level 5 a
guide is necessary. 2. To Baabda, about seven miles from
Beyrout. The journey may be made by carriage. It is the
seat of the government of Lebanon. There is a garrison
and an Emir’s castle, very picturesquelv situated, and from
which there is a famous view.
