BETHLEHEM. ] 93

THE CHURCH OF THE NATIVITY.

The huge fortress-like pile of buildings at the eastern
extremity of the village of Bethlehem comprises the
Church of the Nativity, and the three contiguous
convents belonging respectively to the Latin, Greek, and
Armenian Churches

The Nave of the Church, which is the common pro-
perty of all Christians, and wears a very desolate and
neglected aspect, is the “ oldest monument of Christian
architecture in the world.” It is the sole remaining portion
of the grand Basilica erected here by the Empress Helena,
the mother of Constantine, in 327 11.1). In this ediﬁce, once
brilliant with gold and coloured marbles, Baldwin was
crowned, and the last repairs were executed by Edward IV.
of England.

The Church is still a ﬁne building. It [contains ﬁve
rows of marble columns, of the Corinthian order, each of a
single stone (Pressense’), some of which are said to have
once formed a part of the Temple at Jerusalem. The
mosaics on the walls, considered to date from the original
construction of the ediﬁce, are mostly faded, but here and
there are in good condition. The roof is formed of beams
of rough cedar from Lebanon.

The Chapel or Grotto of the Nativity is a cave
in the rock, over and around which the Church and Convent
buildings are reared, and for the sake of which they exist.
It is twenty feet below the ﬂoor of the church, and is ap-
proached by two spiral staircases.

Descending by either of these staircases, the visitor
enters avault 3 3ft. by IIft., encased with Italian marble, and
decorated with numerous lamps, ﬁgures of saints, embroidery

and various other ornaments.
