NAZARETH TO TIBERIAS. 285

and just below his feet the picturesque town of Nazareth,
rich in gardens and ﬂowers, and fruitful ﬁelds and
plenteous orchards.

There is in Nazareth a good ﬁeld for Christian work,
and there are one or‘two places which will perhaps be -
visited with pleasure. The Protestant Church is a
handsome building, standing in a very commanding
position; it is capable of holding about 500 people, and
the clergyman is a man full of benevolence, and has won
his way to the hearts of many of the people. He labours
under the arrangements of the Church Missionary Society,
and the statistics about three years ago were as follows:
there were, including the out-stations,+5o native Christians,
66 'communicants, and 260 school children.

The Girls’ Orphanage in Nazareth, established by
the Society for Promoting Female Education in the East,
is in a ﬂourishing state under the able management of Miss
Julie Rose, a lady who, with great self-denial, has devoted
her life to this good work.

The handsome new building lately erected is due to her
untiring energy, and if every traveller would withhold a little
undeserved backsheesh, and give it to this deserving insti-
tution, he would be helping on a good cause.
