FOUNTAIN OF JEZREEL. 271

the Turks, thinking a large army was upon them, ﬂed, and
the French arms were victorious.

Instead of going direct across the valley to Shunem, it

will be well to make a short détour to the east, in order to
visit ’Ain Jélﬁd, Or the “ Fountain of Jezreel,” sometimes
called the “ Fountain of Gideon.” The water of the foun-
tain is clear as crystal, issuing from a rocky cavern. It was
here that Gideon was encamped against the Midianites, and
at this fountain each of the three hundred picked men
lapped “ the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth.
And the Lord said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men
that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into
thine hand.” While “the Midianites and the Amalekites
and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like
grasshoppers for multitude, and their camels without num-
ber, as the sand by the sea-side for multitude,”-—slept,—-
Gideon, who had received a vision in a dream, arose, and
dividing “the three hundred men into three cornpanies, he
put a trumpet in every man’s hand, with empty pitchers,
and lamps within the pitchers.” By-and-by, a cry rang
through the startled air, “The sword of the Lord and of
Gideon! ”

Then every man brake his pitcher and the light streamed
forth, “ and they stood every man in his place round about
the camp, and all the host ran, and cried, and ﬂed.” In
the confusion every man’s hand was against his fellow in
the vanquished CMp, the dead and dying strewed the valley,
while the remnant ﬂed down the valley of the Jordan;
and so the sword of the Lord and of Gideon prevailed.

On this very ground where Gideon, “ strong in the Lord,
and in the power of his might,” had gathered his armies
around him, close by the Fountain of Jezreel, Saul pitched
his camp, while the Philistines were encamped over there
