JAFEA. 69

as there is no harbour, the sea is boisterous, and the coast is
dangerous. In this case the traveller must proceed to
Haifa (p. 404.) or Beyrout (p 367). I

Jaffa, or Yafa, is the Joppa of Scripture. Some say it
is named after Japhet, son of Noah, and ancient geographers
aﬂirm that a city existed here before the_Flood ; others derive
it from queh, meaning “beautiful.” Some classic scholars
claim the derivation to be from Iopa, daughter of Eolus,
Jaffa being the reputed scene of the legend of Andromeda.
(In Pliny’s time the chains were still shown with which she
was bound to the rocks by the cruel monster afterwards slain
by Perseus.) In Joshua xix. 46, it is called Japho ; else-
where in the Authorized Version it is Joppa. In the
Apocrypha it is Joppe (I Esdras v. 55).

The Biblical history of Jaffa is this. It is described in I
Joshua xix. 4.6, as in the boundaries of Dan. In Solomon’s
time, when Hiram, King of Tyre, sent the cedar and pine-
wood‘for the building of the Temple, he said in his contract,
“We will cut wood out of Lebanon as much as thou shalt
need, and we will bring it to thee in ﬂoats by sea to Joppa ”
—“ and will cause them to be discharged there ” (I Kings
v. 9)——“ and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem ” (2
Chron. ii. 16).

The materials for the re-building of the Temple under
Zerubbabel were also brought “from Lebanon to the sea of
Joppa ” (Ezra iii. 7). Jonah, ﬂeeing “from the presence of the
Lord, went down to Joppa, and be found a ship going to Tar-
shish ” (Jonah i. 3). The succeeding circumstances are re-
ferred to by our Lord as typical of himself (Matt. xii. 40).

Here Peter raised Dorcas to life (p. 71), and here the
Apostle had that remarkable vision, showing him that
the distinction between Jew and Gentile was for ever abolished
