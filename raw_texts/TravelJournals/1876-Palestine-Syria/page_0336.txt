there. Any travellers who may have determined to report
that in Palestine “ all is barren,” will do well to reconsider
their verdict here.

Huntn was a strongly fortiﬁed town, or perhaps a fortress
merely, but its history is unknown. It remains to-day a
mass of stupendous ruin, and exhibits traces of almost every
style of architecture. It has been surmised by Dr. Robin-
son that it may correspond with Beth-Rehob (Judges xviii.
28), but this is a mere surmise.

Descending into the valley, we see the village of Abil,
“ set on a hill." It correSponds with'the Abel- Beth-Maachah
(Meadow of the House of Maachah), called also Abel
Maim, or Meadow of Water (2 Chron. xvi. 4). Here came
Sheba in his ﬂight, and hither pursued Joab, who demanded
that he should be delivered up. “ Sheba, said Joab, hath
lifted up his hand against the king, even against David;
deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the
woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to
thee over the wall. . . . And they cut off the .head of Sheba,
the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a
trumpet, and they retired from the city every man to his
tent" (2 Sam. xx. 13—22). The city was taken by Ben-
hadad (1 Kings xv. 20), and at a later date Tiglath-Pileser
carried off its people (2 Kings xv. 299.

From here we proceed to a little village called Mel‘j
Ayﬁn, the ancient Ijon, a city spoiled by Benhadad (1 Kings
xv. 16), and from thence to Tell-el-Kadi (p. 319), and Banias

(p. 321).
