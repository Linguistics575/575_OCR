The College is conducted upon strictly Protestant and
Evangelical principles, but is open to students from any of
the Oriental sects and nationalities who will conform to its
regulations. °

The sects already represented are the Protestant, Ortho-
dox Greek, Papal Greek, Latin, Maronite, Druse, and
Armenian. Direct proselytism is not attempted 3 but, with-
out endeavouring to force Protestantism upon students of
other sects, every effort is made by the personal intercourse
of professors and instructors, in the class-room and at other
times, and by the general exercises and arrangements of the
institutions, to bring each member into contact with the
distinctive features of Evangelical truth.

The Medical Department, under the management -
of several professors, is a speCial feature in connection with
the American Mission. Native practitioners-have hitherto
been grossly ignorant and incompetent.

The School of Medicine furnishes a professional training
in accordance with the principles and practice of modern
science, and is well attended by students, who receive a four-
years’ training.

There is also in connection with the Mission a Print—
ing Press, which provides an ample and instructive litera-
ture, and spreads the principlesof the Mission by means of
a weekly newspaper. . '

Divine Service is conducted every Sunday in the
handsome church of the American Mission.

The Brown Ophthalmic Hospital, founded by

11 American gentleman of that name, was instituted in con-
sequence of the inability to meet the needs of the people
during the epidemics of Ophthalmia. It has been most suc-
cessful in preventing the loss of sight to many in the land,
where this particular form of disease is so prevalent.
