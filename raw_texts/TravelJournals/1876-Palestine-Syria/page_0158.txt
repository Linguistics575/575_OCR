by the Emperor Justinian in honour of the Virgin. De Vogiié
afﬁrms that the present structure is entirely Arabian, but
that its form of a Basilica, its cruciform plan, and the exist-

Mosque are connected by a rude architrave, which consists
of beams of roughly-squared timber, inclosed in a casing of
one-inch stuff, on which the decoration, such as it is, is
