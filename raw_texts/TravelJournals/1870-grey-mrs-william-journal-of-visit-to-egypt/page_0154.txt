never seen us, as he should feel quite lonely and mis-

regret, and also to Colonel Stanton, who is most pleas-
ant and kind, and with heavy hearts we were making
up our minds for a ﬁnal start at ﬁve o’clock, especial-
ly as it was blowing very hard, indeed a perfect hur—
ricane. We were just watching the two steamers for
Marseilles and Malta, having great apparent trouble

twisted round it that it could not be . got free without
a diver. So we' had to remain where we were all
night, and I confess I was. thankful to get a quiet
good night’s rest, instead of the tossing that evidently
awaited us outside.
