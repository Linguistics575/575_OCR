Drive Mroug/z Seéasz‘opol. I 8 3

April 13. We had intended to commence our
day’s sight-seeing today at nine o’clock, but- it rain-
ed, so that we did not get off till eleven. We ﬁrst
went to the Old Fort Nicholas, the landing-place on
the south side, where we found a guard of honor
drawn up, and a drotska waiting, into which the Prin-
cess and I got; the Prince and all the gentlemen
mounting horses which had been provided for them.
We then went up the main street leading to the head
of the Dock-yard Creek, accompanied by Gen. Kotze-
'bue and his staff, and with a large escort of Tartars.

It was really sad to see every other house, and'
most of the principal buildings in this part of the
town, still in ruins; and you can still trace the marks
of the balls in the walls that are left standing. Pass-
ing the .site of the Creek Battery and the Barrack
Battery, etc., we visited what was known as the
“ White Buildings,” the Hospital, etc., .the walls of
which alone remain standing, completely riddled with
shot and shell, and the ground covered with ruins.
It was really melancholy to see all this, and then to
think how little this frightful scene of desolation, with
all its accompanying bloodshed and loss of life, is
now even' thought of! I could not help feeling a
little ashamed in presence of these Russians, think-
ing what their feelings must be at having to show

.
