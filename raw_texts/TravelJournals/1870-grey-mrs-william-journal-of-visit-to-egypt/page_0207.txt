hours without stopping from Brindisi to Turin. We
arrived there at half. past three on Monday, May 3d,
and left it again at half past eight on the 4th, and

ter before nine on the 5th.

The only part of our journey to which I would
give a passing word is the crossing of Mont Cenis.
Changing at Susa into carriages made exPressly for
the passage of the mountain, we completed-the ascent
in about two hours, and most interesting I found it.
The sharp turns which the road makes in winding up
the mountain’s side, the fearflﬂ precipices on every
side of us, the avalanches and immense drifts of snow
which we passed, kept one all the way in a state of
nervous excitement and admiration.

May 12. We remained in Paris from the ﬁfth till
yesterday evening, in the usual round of visits, din-
ners, reviews, etc., and were treated, it is needless to
say, with the most marked distinction by the Emperor
and Empress. At half past six yesterday evening we
left on our, return to England, and arrived at the
Charin g Cross station at half past six this morning.

All. that now remained was to bid farewell to all
our pleasant traveling companions, and for each to
betake himself or herself to their respective homes
