the French line had stood, till we came a little way
beyond where Prince Napoleon’s division had been
drawn up, and then, turning back, drove along. the
whole position occupied by the English army before
the action commenced; and so on to a Tartar farm-
house which had been used as a ﬁeld-hespital on the
20th of September, 1855, but where now a most ex-
cellent luncheon had been prepared for us by the
. Russians.

At ﬁve- o’clock we again got into our drotskas, and
drove back. to the north side of Sebastopol, from
whence we had started, crossing the Katcha and
Belbek rivers by the way. We were fortunate in
having with us in Mr. Russell, Major Alison, and
Captain Ellis, three people who had been there dur-
ing the war, and they now pointed out to 11s the dif-
ferent points of interest in the road—where the army
turned oﬂ to make its ﬂank march, etc. Our way
back led us through the Severnaia, or Star Fort, and
a long line of earth-works thrown up by the Russians
after the south side fell. The pace at which we
drove home was tremendous; but these Russian
coachmen drive beautifully, and I can not say I felt
frightened. It was seven o’clock when we got back
to the Ariadne, where the Russian gentlemen all
dined with us.
