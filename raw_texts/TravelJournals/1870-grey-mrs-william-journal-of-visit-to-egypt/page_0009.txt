IO yourml of a V2192? to 5gp}, 69?.

spent with my eldest brother, lately appointed Swed-
ish Minister at Copenhagen, to return to England to-
ward the end of October.

These plans were, however, all upset by a letter
from the Princess, in which she told me that she
wished me to accompany her on the tour she project-
ed with the Prince of Wales to the East, and to join
her at Copenhagen in the beginning of January;
and that in the mean time I might remain quietly—
which she knew would be a pleasure to me—with my

father and mother in Sweden. This was too tempt- .

ing an offer not to be eagerly embraced, and accord-
ingly, after six months spent happily with my dear
parents, I left Stockholm at 6 RM. on the 10th of
January, to join her Royal Highness at Copenhagen.
At ﬁve o’clock I went to say good-by once more to
my dear mother and brother, who were neither of
them well enough to come to the station, to which
my father and many friends accompanied me to see
me off.

The weather was dull, but very mild (8° Cent.
above 0); and being 17° in the railway carriage, all
the precautions against cold, of fur cloaks and wrap-
pers, were quite unnecessary. At 11 RM. I arrived
at Elmhult, where I was delighted to ﬁnd a clean

and warm bed.
