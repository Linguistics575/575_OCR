Dress of Me Slaves. 39

I did not see a single really pretty face, and hardly
.even a good - looking one among them. However,
they told us that there are a couple of pretty ones,
but for some reason or other they were not allowed
to show to-day. Altogether, there are 500 slaves in
this harem, and about twenty of them were. always
standing at a short distance from our chairs wherever
we went. They are dressed in the most ridiculous
and tasteless manner, in the European fashion, but
no two alike. One had a bright yellow dress with a
green velvet jacket; another a green velvet skirt with
a red or blue jacket; and so on. Some had hideous
round hats with bright ﬂowers and feathers; some had
beads in their hair. In short, they were dressed in
the most vulgar and ugly manner it is possible to im-
agine. A great many had diamond ornaments, ear-
rings, and brooches, and a few had the Viceroy’s ﬁc-
ture set in diamonds on their shoulder. I think it is
a great pity that they have not a regular costume, as
their present way of dressing very much spoils the
otherwise so very Eastern eﬁect and look of the ha-
rem. Sitting there in the midst of these Princesses,
dressed in their splendid jewels and all their ﬁnery,
and surrounded by their slaves, reminded one of the
descriptions one reads in the Arabian Nights or some
old fairy tale. '
