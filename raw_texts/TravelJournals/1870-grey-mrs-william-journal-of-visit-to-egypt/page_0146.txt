ner, the lakes, which extend upward of forty miles,
will in ﬁve or six months be quite ﬁlled, and in the
part through which the canal goes there will be a
depth of thirty feet of water. Having inspected the
dam, we re-embarked and returned toward the north,
by the Maritime Canal, to Lake Timsah (Arabic for
crocodile). We arrived there at ﬁve o’clock, but it
was past six before we got to Ismaila, where a tri-
umphal arch had been erected at the landing-place,
troops lining the road, etc. Lord Huntly, Lord Gos-
ford, and Sir H. Pelly joined us here, having arrived
from Cairo in a special train given by the Viceroy.

The Prince and Princess got into a basket-carriage
drawn by four horses ; I was put, with some of’ the
gentlemen, into another; and the rest of the party
followed on horseback. We thus passed through the
town, and drove about three miles farther through the
desert to the Viceroy’s chalet, a very pretty little pa-
vilion, built on high ground overlooking Lake Tim-
sah. . ‘

The Prince and Princess and myself were lodged
here, the rest of the party, amounting to eighteen, be-
ing doubled 'np in some small outhouses and tents
' close by. Dinner was served in a large tent below
the pavilion; the French party, who had been with us
all day, coming to dinner in a small steamer.
