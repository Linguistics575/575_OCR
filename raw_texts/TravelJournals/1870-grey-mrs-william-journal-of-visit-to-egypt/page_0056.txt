Temple of Dendera. 5 7

The Princess and myself spent all the afternoon in
our dahabeah, drawing and painting. We stopped for
the night at Girgeh. Dined and spent the evening as
usual. '

February 14. A most beautiful day, the ﬁrst Sun-
day in Lent. The Prince read the service to us and
the servants very impressively. Such ﬁne warm
weather; not a cloud to be seen! Arrived at Keneh
at 4.45, and stopped for the night.

February 15. As soon as breakfast was over we
started, about 10.30, on ‘our donkeys, to see the ruins
of Dendera, a ride of three miles in a very hot sun.
The temple of Dendera is very ﬁne, and about 1800
years old,* much less ancient, therefore, than other
temples in this country. Notwithstanding its grand-
eur, I can not say it made the impression upon me
which I expected, though, perhaps, I ought not to ac-
knowledge this. The roof is formed of enormous
slabs of stones, on which you still see the pattern of
stars, etc., engraved, the walls being also covered with
hieroglyphics. Got back to the steamer at two o’clock,
very hot, but having enjoyed the morning very much.

* I must say, once for all, that I don’t profess to be accurate either
in names 'or dates. I am not writing a history or description of the
country. I simply put down what I was told, and as I understood it

I
at the time.
