ever, we only visited those known as “ E1 Kaédbai”
and “ El Ashraf.” About ﬁve o’clock we returned
home, and the Princess and I started soon after with '
Abdel Kader Bey for the Turkish Bazar, where the
Princess bought a bournouse and other things. The
mode of shopping here is certainly peculiar. You sit
down on the edge of the counter or stop of the shop,
and .ask for what you, want: they then invariably
show you something quite diiferent, and it is a long-
while before the article you ask for is produced.
Then the bargaining begins: the man asks you a
price, and you then offer half. The bargaining goes
on, at ﬁrst in good-humor, then in rather cross words,
but generally ends with your knocking down the sum
to nearly half that he had asked at ﬁrst. One is quite
sans gé'ne, and puts on and tries the things in the mid-
dle of the street. Still one must have plenty of time
and patience to get any thing, as they insist upon ﬁrst
taking down every thing in the shop. For instance, '
if you say you wish for a silk scarf, you must ﬁrst
look at all their beads, pipes, table-co vers, and em-
broidered slippers; and though they must perfectly
well see that you don’t want any thing of the sort, °
they seem much more eager to spread out these things
than those you want to buy 1 We did not agree about .
