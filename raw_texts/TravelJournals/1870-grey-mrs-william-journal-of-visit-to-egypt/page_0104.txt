ﬂags, etc.; and as we approached the bank, rockets
and blue lights were burnt, to light up the ruins of
the old Temple of Luxor.

Colonel Stanton, Sir H. Pelly, Major Alison, and
Abdel Kader Bey met us here, and came on board
our boat, having been here since we left Assouan.
Colonel Stanton had remained to superintend some
excavations for the Prince, and he had asked the oth-
er two gentlemen to stay with him; while our Egyp-
tian aid-de-camp was left on account of our scarcity
of room in the small boats used above the First Cat-
aract. Mourad Pasha accompanied us all the way.
I think I never met with any body more really kind
and amiable than Mourad Pasha. He has quite
adapted himself to our manner of living, and seems
perfectly to understand our ways, and is always ready
to enter into’ all our wish es and amusements.

As all our steamers, with food, etc., were left be-
hind, a_ telegram had been sent off last night to 001-
onel Stanton to prepare him to give us a dinner in
his boat. And a very good one we had. The mutual
adventures of the two parties during the last fortnight
were told, a speech was made, and a toast proposed
by Mourad Pasha to the health of the Prince and
Princess, this being the anniversary of their wedding-
day.
