nothing to be seen of the Prince or any one. After
pulling in this manner for two hours, we ame at last
to where the road leads off to Philae, and, on getting
out of the boat, found, to our delight, two boys with
two wretched donkeys, without bridles, and only one
of them with any thing like a saddle, and that a mis-
erable sort of wooden affair. The other had nothing
but a cushion tied on. In spite of all this, we mount-
ed these animals in the best way we could, the Prin-
cess on the one with the cushion, and I on that with
the wooden saddle. Such as they were, we were real-
ly grateful for them, as the heat was now quite un-
bearable (I should say not less than 1209 Fain), and
the prospect of a long walk through the deep burning
sand was not tempting. I found it rather difﬁcult at
ﬁrst to keep my seat on the donkey, as there was noth-
ing to hold on by, and it was, consequently, a mere
question of balance. But one of the gentlemen
walked by me ready to help me in case of need.
The wooden saddle, too, was so uncomfortable that,
at last, I had it taken off, and rode on the bare back.
My great diﬁiculty was that my legs hung down so
low as almost to touch the ground, in clambering up
some rough and narrow places, where the path was
full of stones. The Princess got on beautifully, and
I think we both enjoyed our day’s adventure.
