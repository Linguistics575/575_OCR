26 faunas] of a V £52? to Egypt, 69?.

At ﬁve we arrived at Cairo, where we were re-
ceived by the Viceroy; the special train running
through the public station to the Viceroy’s private
one, opposite the garden of Kazr-el-Nil. Their Roy-
al Highnesses were also met here by Mrs. Stanton
and General McLean, with his wife and daughter.

The Viceroy and his eldest son took the Prince and
Princess to an immense hall in the. Palace, where I
and all the suite followed, and were all presented to
the Viceroy. We then went" straight to carriages
which were waiting for us in the large court-yard—
English carriages and horses, with postilions and liv-
eries in the English fashion — and then, with regi-
ments of Zouaves drawn up all round, and an escort
of Lancers following each of the ﬁrst carriages, we
drove to the Palace Esbekieh, which has been appro-
priated to the Prince of Wales during our stay in
Egypt. .The Prince and Princess and the Viceroy
were in the ﬁrst carriage; the young Prince and I,
with Mourad Pasha, in the next, and so on.

The Palace of Esbekieh is beautiful ;‘ full of
French luxury, but without the real comfort of an
English house. The Prince and Princess have an
immense bedroom, .full of rich French furniture.
The beds are very beautiful, made of massive silver,
and cost, I believe, £3000 each ! My room is so large
