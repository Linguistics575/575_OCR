Important Letters. I I 9

- in when I found myself again in my enormous bed-
room. However, I felt very grateful that our jour-
ney so far had gone off so well, and that we had all
been perfectly well since we arrived six weeks ago in
Egypt.

I must add here, what I have omitted to mention
in the proper place, that, on our way down the Nile,
the Prince received letters to say that the differences
between Greece and Turkey had been happily settled,
and that their Royal Highnesses were now free to
pay their proposed visits to Constantinople and Ath-
ens. The original plan will therefore be adhered to,
and Mr. Elliot, our Embassador at Constantinople, has
been written to to say that he may expect us there,
after visiting the Suez Canal, about the end of the
month.
