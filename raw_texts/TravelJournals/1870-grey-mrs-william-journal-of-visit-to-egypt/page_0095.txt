journey home, which we can never expect to ﬁnd so
pleasant and enjoyable as this has been. As soon as
we arrive in Cairo, the duties of the great world, with
all its fuss and bustle, must again begin; and as we
get farther and farther into Europe, this sort of life .
. will only go on crescendo, and I often ask myself
when shall I ever lead such a peaceful life again? I
felt this not only for myself, but perhaps more strong-
ly still for the Princess, who, like me, has enjoyed it
all immensely. However, it was no use grumbling to
one’s self, and so I got on a nice dromedary, and, with '
the rest of the party, proceeded homeward.

The Prince and some of the gentlemen went by
boat. The Princess rode my donkey, and I felt as
comfortable on my high beast as if I had been on a
horse. In choosing a dromedary, the great thing is
to select a small and thin one, and then, at a short
trot, they are really very comfortable and very easy
to manage. We again crossed in boats, and arrived
at Wady Halfah at 6.30. Dined at eight o’clock, and
had done quite enough to be ready for our beds at
ten. No heat today to complain of; indeed, since
we left the First Cataract on our way up, the breeze
has been mostly from the north, and the sky rather
cloudy, which has made the temperature quite com-
fortable. '
