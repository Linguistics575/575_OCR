To resume the day’s history. The Russian authors
ities having paid their respects to the Prince and '
Princess, and offered every assistance in their power
toward showing every thing there was tobe seen, we

where a pretty chapel has been erected as a mauso-
leum to the soldiers and sailors that fell during the
siege. The interior is not yet quite ﬁnished, but
promises to be exceedingly handsome when complete,
with beautiful frescoes and mosaics on the walls, and
a splendid head of our Savior in the middle of the
ceiling.
