these scenes to Englishmen, who they must have felt
would only regard with pride such monuments of
their victories over their unfortunate countrymen.
But they behaved beautifully, and even pointed out
to us the diﬁerent places where they had been beaten!

We drove thence along the site of the famous
Radon, to the point in front of that work where the
monument to the British troops who fell in the at-
tacks upon it, and in the trenches, has been erected.
The lines of the English trenches, zigzagging in all
directions over the old battle—ﬁelds, and the sites of
the batteries, are still to be distinctly traced, and give
one a more vivid idea of what it must have been at
the time of the siege, than all one can read about it.
The gentlemen who had been here showed us the
very spots where their huts had stood, etc.

From this 'we drove by the “Quamries” to the left
of the right attack, above the “ Woronzow Ravine,”
and thence across an open space to “ Cathcart’s Hi1 ,”
where a quarter of an hour was spent in ' examining
the tomb-stones. Many picked wild-ﬂowers here for
the friends of those who were here buried. There
are not less than seventy-one diiferent cemeteries or
burying-places for the English who fell during the
war; but I am sorry to' say they do not seem to have
been taken care of as they ought to have been.
