Berlin. I 5

ten, and remained there more than two hours. I and
all the suite dined with Lord A. Loftus at ﬁve o’clock.
At 9.30 there was a great ball at the King’s palace,
in the round _white hall. It was very pretty, and the
decorations of all the adjoining rooms very bright,
and tastefully done. Came home at three o’clock.

January 26). Went out shopping early in the morn-
ing with my maid, and at one o’clock to a skating
party at the same place as yesterday, where regiment-
al bands played, and a breakfast was given by the
King. It was a pretty sight, but for those who, like
myself, did not skate, a very cold pleasure, though
we were pushed about in small sledges.

We dined at ﬁve o’clock at the Crown Prince’s
palace, and at seven o’clock went to the ballet, Flick
and Flack. We returned home after it to change
our dresses, and at eleven left Berlin by the ordinary
train for Vienna, being accompanied~to the station by
the Crown Prince and Princess and their suite, and
met there by the English Embassador and the mem-
bers of the British Embassy, the Danish Minister and
his wife, etc. It was frightfully cold all night; the
thermometer in my carriage was below zero Centi-
grade, and when I awoke in the morning I found a
heap of snow on my feet that had come in through
the window! - -
