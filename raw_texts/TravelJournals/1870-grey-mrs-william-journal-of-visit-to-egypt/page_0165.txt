sudden appearance of the Sultan’s son, aged ten, and
daughter, aged nine, who both came marching. in, fol-
lowed by slaves; he, dressed in full uniform, with a
large diamond star and ribbon; she, dressed in a very
' smart pink satin dress, with a train quite two yards
long, all covered with lace, a very high diamOnd tiara,
which nearly crushed her, and very heavy though
splendid necklaces and earrings, etc.; while, to com-
plete the whole costume, she had a pair of scarlet
gloves, with one enormous diamond on one ﬁnger
outside the glove! The poor little thing could hard-
ly move under all the lace and ﬁnery she was cover-
ed with. I suppose it was owing to their being so
° overdressed that they both looked even younger and
paler than they are in reality. It was very amusing,
however, to see them place themselves, in the most
digniﬁed manner possible, in large arm-chairs opposite
us, the little Princess doing nothing but slip down
hers, when a slave helped her up again.
