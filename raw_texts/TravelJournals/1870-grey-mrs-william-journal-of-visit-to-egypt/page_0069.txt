means' of the small steamer, which dragged it oif.

While we were here struggling to get off, two poor
men who had just landed, I fancy to get a “View of

large sailing boat, which they had not suﬂiciently
drawn up on shore, had get loose, and was drifting
down the river. They were just going to throw
themselves into the water to swim after the boat,
when Colonel Marshall and Mr. Montagu jumped into
a small boat, and started oif to bring back the drift-

way of expressing their pleasure seemed rather odd,
when, instead of thanking the gentlemen for their
trouble, they put out their hands, and, with the usual
word. “ Backshees ,” actually tried to make some
money out of it.
