some chairs, and all is told! Even in the bedroom of
la Grande Princesse there Was not a single bit of fur-
niture except a high divan, and a low one with a
striped blanket spread over it, which they said was
her bed. Not a table of any sort in the room, nor a
sign of any washing materials. Still they all seem
very clean, as they regularly take their Turkish baths,
which are arranged in every apartment.

After having inspected every corner of the upper
story—the young Prince, who accompanied us and
acted as our interpreter (which, as he spoke French
ﬂuently, and was most kind and amiable, he did ex-
tremely well), saying, “ La Princesse doit tout voir”——
after, I say, inspecting the upper story most minutely
and conscientiously, we went down stairs again, which,
to us, is a very easy matter, but which seemed very
difﬁcult for these poor Princesses in their Turkish
dresses. Indeed, they could hardly m0ve on at all,
their legs seeming to be wrapped up in a kind of -
wide trowsers, or long petticoats made of some soft
white stuff, which, with their long trains, made them
very awkward.

We found the ,old Princess, who had not accompa-
nied us up stairs, waiting for us below. We then sat
down in the same way as we had done before, and
music and dancing again began, only a new set of
slaves had taken the place of the former ones.
