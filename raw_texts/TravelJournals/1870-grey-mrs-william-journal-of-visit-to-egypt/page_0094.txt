Dinner at [a Turgue. 9 5

beautiful waterfalls I have seen in. Sweden and Scot-

land. The view, however, was very extensive and
very wild; and, as usual, the lights and coloring of

the whole country before us struck me more than .
any thing else. We then went a little farther,'to where
some large tents had been pitched just above the cat-
aract ;' and the cooks having also been sent on early
in the day, we found an excellent dinner waiting for
us, and being 'quite ready for it, after our early rising
and long ride, we certainly did justice to it. Mourad
Pasha had taken in hand the arrangements of the

'day, and wished us to have ,a real Turkish dinner.

Two whole roasted lambs were brought in, but, much
to his disgust, he only succeeded in making us sit
down on the ground in the Turkish fashion, with our
legs crossed, but could not persuade us' to eat in their
fashion, tearing off bits with our ﬁngers. We had
also some other excellent Arabian dishes, pilau or pi-
laf, a'kind of rice dish, very good. Coffee and‘smok-
ing followed as usual, and we then enjoyed the view,
and the nice breeze, till at' last we were told it was
time to go home. I felt very sorry to leave this place,
after a most pleasant and successful picnic; but I
also felt that we were now at the turning-point of our
travels; that we had reached their farthest limit, and
that this was actually the beginning of our return
