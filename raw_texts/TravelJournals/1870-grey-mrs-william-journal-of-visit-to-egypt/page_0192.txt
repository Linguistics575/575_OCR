Beautiful V z'llas.——Leave Me C rz'mea. I 9 3

to visit several other villas in the neighborhood.
First one close to Livadia, belonging to the Cezaro-

witch; then by the same road we came yesterday to—

a large one belonging to the Grand Duke Constan-
tine; and so on to Aloupka, a most beautiful villa of
Prince Woronzoif’s. Prince Troubetskoi, brother to
the Princess Woronzoﬁ, had come here by her desire
to receive the Prince and Princess of Wales. We
looked at every thing inside and outside the house,
admiring it all beyond measure, and then sat down
to a magniﬁcent luncheon. As soon as that was over,
we drove in some small pony-carriages through the
grounds (I driving Sir A. Buchanan), ending at the
landing - place, whence we went oﬁ to embark once
more in the Am'ad/rw, which had come round from
Yalta to take us on board.

All our Russian friends came on. board to take
leave, and at seven o’clock, bidding them ﬁnally
farewell, we left the Crimea, with much regret on my
part that our time in that beautiful country had been
so short. The four days spent among these most
amiable and most hospitable Russians have been very
happy ones, and I don’t think there is any part of our
travels on which I shall look back with more pleasure.
I only feel that the time allowed us was much too
short to enable us really to enjoy our visit to this
