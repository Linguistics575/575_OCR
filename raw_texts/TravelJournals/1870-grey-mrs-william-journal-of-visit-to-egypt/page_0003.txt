would do more than this. Your Royal Highness will
not therefore wonder at my being surprised, when the
ﬁrst thing given to me, on my arrival at St. J ames’s
Palace, was a parcel carefully scaled up, with a letter,
of which I copy an extract, as the best exPlanation of
the way in which my-Journal has come to be printed.

“ You will be surprised,” the General writes, “ on.
your return home, to see the shape your Journal has
taken—that it is actually in print! Yes, without
consulting a living soul, or even waiting for your
own consent, I have taken it upon myself to have it
printed. '

“ I h0pe you won’t be. vexed. You will see in the
title-page that it is only ‘ privately printed’—not even
for what is called ‘ private circulation’——in fact, there
are as yet only three copies—one for yourself, one
which I thought you might like to give the Princess,
and a third which I hope you will allow me to keep.
N 0 one has the least suspicion of what I have done;
nor have I myself seen the little volume since it was
put together. It rests, therefore, entirely with you to
decide whether it shall go further. I can not myself
see why you should not publish it almost just as it is.
