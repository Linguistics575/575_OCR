head, feet, and hands, before entering. the mosque
for their prayers. We found several men kneeling
down and praying in the mosque. It struck me here,
as‘ it has often done elsewhere in Egypt, that their de-
votion must be, most sincere, if you are -to judge by
the strict observance of their hours of ,prayer. It
really seems almost ridiculous to see these people,
without a moment’s notice or reﬂection, throw them-
selves down on their knees, turning their heads to-
ward Mecca, wherever they are, and whatever their
work may be, when the hour of prayer comes, which
they calculate by the sun. 'On board our boats one
constantly saw the captain and sailors, in the midst of
their work, and always at six o’clock, kneel down on
deck, praying, and kissing the ground.

Ascending by a- narrow staircase in a tower (a very
diﬂicult matter, as it was very steep and perfectly
dark), we got on to the leads to look at the view, and
had an excellent one, over the whole town and coun-
try round, with the Pyramids in the distance; but
the.wind was very high, and consequently the air was
full of dust, which produced almost the effect of a
fog all over the place. ’ The dust here is a perfect
plague; and it is so ﬁne that it goes through every
thing in the way of veils, and spoils both one’s eyes

and clothes.
