T/zeatrz'cakr—T/ze Viceroy. I 2 9

Europe, very few carriages and people altogether, and
the whole thing very poor and dull. The Viceroy’s
horses won three races. There was also a donkey-
race, which was very amusing; and the Syces (the
boys who. run before the carriages) also had a race.
A large luncheon was served in a tent, and at six
o’clock we started on our return, dined, and dressed
as fast as we could, and at 8.30 proceeded to “ Kazr-
el-Nil,” the palace where the Viceroy had invited us to
a theatrical entertainment. The pieces were French,
and beautifully acted—Les Femmes gm: pleurent and

' La Carole Sensible. Between the pieces a Hunga-

' rian singer, Mdlle. Sarotta, simg, as did also a French
actor, a most amusing song, the “ refrain” of which
was “ Hein, hein, Cela ne ‘va guere, C’est une tres
mauvaise affaire.” The room- was very hot. We .
had supper afterward down stairs, the royalties and

' myself together at a small table in a separate room.

The Viceroy is on all these occasions most civil
and amiable to every body, and his eldest son is quite
charming—very nice, civil manners, and, when not
shy, he has got plenty to say for himself; and as he
has had to drag me about, and sit near me at all these
entertainments, we are become great friends. He is
very anxious to improve himself, and is now learning
four languages, working very hard from nine till four
