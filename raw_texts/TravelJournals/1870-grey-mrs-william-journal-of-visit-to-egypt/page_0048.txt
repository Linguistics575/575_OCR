First Day on t/ze N 273. 49

er, Lord A. Gower, and Sir Henry Pelly, arrived the
evening before we left Cairo, and are taken by 0010-
nel Stanton in his boat, the Duke’s being already full.

I think we shall have a very happy and quiet time,
for all the party seem likely to agree, and to be dis-
posed to make the best of every thing. The weather
is still bitterly cold, only 10° Centigrade in my cabin!

At six o’clock stopped for the night, and some of '
the Duke’s party joined us after dinner.

Februcm/ '7. Sunday—but not at all like Sunday
to my mind, as we steamed on the same as any other
' day. '

I can not say I have been struck, so far, by the
beauty of the scenery. On the contrary, the banks
of the river are ﬂat, ugly, and monotonous, of a light
[yellowish sand-color, with here and there a few palm-
trees and small villages, which, if you did not see some
of the inhabitants standing outside, you would never
believe to be the habitations of human beings. They
consist of small square huts, made of earth, with noth-
ing but a hole for the door, and numbers of earthen
jars at the top, forming a sort of parapet, and accom-
modating innumerable pigeons. The young pigeons
are excellent to eat, and it was with horror that the
poor inhabitants saw our sporting-party land for the
purpose of practising with their guns at the old birds.
