Landing at A lexandrz'a. 2 5

adne, meanwhile, played on board; and music, such
as it was, in many of the boats, added to the eﬁect.
I At eleven o’clock we disembarked under salutes
from the Ariadne and other ships, and from the
shore, and were met on landing by the Viceroy’s eld-
est son, Mehemet Taaﬁk Pasha, as well as by num-
bers of ofﬁcers and ofﬁcial persons of all sorts, in full
uniform. The ofﬁcers appointed to attend upon the
Prince during his stay in Egypt—Mourad Pasha and
Abdel Kader Bey—came on board the Ariadne be-
fore we landed. State carriages were provided for
us in the railway, to which we walked up; a regi-
ment of Zouaves of the Guard lining the way up to
the station, where there was a guard of honor. The
number of people out to see us was enormous, form—
ing, indeed, a regular wall of natives on both sides
all the way up. The effect of their beautiftu bright
dresses was very striking; even those who were scant-
ily clothed, or not clothed at all, having always some
bright cap or handkerchief on their head, which gave
them a bright appearance; and I must say I was im-
mensely struck by it all. At 3 PM. we arrived at
Kafr Zayat, and got out at the station to have lunch-
eon, which was a grand affair; and after it large pipes
were brought into the carriage, and every body smoked

and had coffee.
