16 7ourmzl of a Visit to Egypt, (557.

J amuwy 21. Traveled all day. The weather bit-
terly cold (10° of frost, Reaumur).

Prince Teck joined us at Breslau at 7 A.M. We
breakfasted at Qderberg, and arrived at Vienna at 8
P.M., and were met at the station by the Emperor.

Drove straight to the Burg, where the Empress re-
ceived us in the hall, looking beautiful, dresSed all in
white and diamonds. She was attended by Countess
Ko'nigsegg, the Princess Taxis, and Countess Hunya-
dy. General Baron Schall, Count Bellegarde, and
Baron Bechtelsheim, are appointed by the Emperor
to be in attendance on the Prince and Princess dur-
ing their stay here. The Prince and Princess have a
splendid 'suite of rooms in the Burg. I, too, am very
comfortably lodged.

January 22. The cold to-day is greatly increased
(14° Reaumur). We spent all the morning in calling
upon the royalties: ﬁrst, the Empress and the Dow-
ager Empress; then the Archduchess Sophie (the Em-
peror’s mother), with archdukes and duchesses with-
out end, whose names would be too long and too many
I to enumerate. -

The Prince and Princess dined at six o’clock with
the Emperor and Empress (Familien Tafel), and all
the suite with the household; after which we went
to the ballet Sproly‘éuer at the Opera. 9
