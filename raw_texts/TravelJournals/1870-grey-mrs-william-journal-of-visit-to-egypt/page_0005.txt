vi Dedication.

but I am somewhat encouraged by your Royal High-
ness’s kind permission to dedicate it to you. In fact,
it can have no interest except in so far as it is con-
nected with your Royal Highnesses.

I know well, dear Princess, how indulgent your
Royal Highness and the Prince of Wales will be to
it; and I do hope that it may at- least serve to recall
to you and the Prince the recollection of many pleas-
ant scenes and events, and of what was to me, owing
entirely to both your Royal Highnesses’ invariable
kindness to me, a most happy time.

I remain your Royal Highness’s most devoted and
affectionately attached servant,

THERESA GREY.

Marlborough House, December 4, 1869.
