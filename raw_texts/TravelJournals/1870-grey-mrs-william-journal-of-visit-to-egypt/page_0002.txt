TO HER ROYAL HIGHN'ESS
THE PRINCESS OF WALES.

ADAM,—I know not how suﬁiciently to thank
- your Royal Highness for allowing me to dedi-
cate my little book to you. It is another, added to
the many kindnesses I have already received from
you, and I am grateful from the bottom of my heart.
Your Royal Highness can not be more surprised
than I am myself at seeing my Journal in print!
You know how, and when it was written—that it
was written from day to day, often under difﬁculties,
as a. record to myself of a very happy time, and which
members of my family might perhaps like to see;
but, most assuredly, with no view to publication. In
fact, till last Saturday, when I returned home from
Sweden, I had not the slightest idea of its being print-
ed. I had left it with my brother-in-law, General
Grey, when I went abroad last July, asking him mere-
ly to correct some of my Swedish mistakes of gram-
mar, in case I should wish to copy it out more fairly
