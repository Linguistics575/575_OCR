Ride t/zrougﬁ Ike Desert. 9 I

aract. It was a very hot day; and a. very hot, dusty,
and dreary ride we had through the desert. We had
been told it was four and a half miles off; but at last,
after we had ridden, as we guessed, about eight miles,
seeing that we had been quite "deceived in our infor-
mation as to the distance, and being told that we had
not yet come half way, we stopped, and settled to
lunch where we were. I confess I was very glad to
get off my uncomfortable saddle. The natives here
never have the smallest idea of time or distance, nor
does the former seem of any value to them. You can
therefore never trust to their information as to how
far you are from a place, nor the time it will take to
go there, as you are sure to be deceived.

We now settled down under a high cliff, and began
our luncheon, which, as” well as all the English serv-
ants, had followed us on some dromedaries. Sitting
down in the hot sand, which blew in our eyes and into
our plates, was not very agreeable; still, considering
- that we were now in the great Nubian Desert, we
were, comparatively, very luxuriously off. This, how-
ever, has been the case all through our trip in Egypt,
chieﬂy, I must say,'thanks to all our English servants,
who have shown the greatest anxiety and zeal to make
every body and every thing comfortable, never mind-
ing their own convenience or how hard they had to
work.
