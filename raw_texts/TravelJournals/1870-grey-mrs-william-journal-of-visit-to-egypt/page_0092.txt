comes back three times in the year, on particular days,
when all relations and friends are expected to go to
the grave and there distribute offerings to the poor,
who then come there to receive them. Every body
brings some dish or other, or clothes, money being of
less use to the poor here.

They seem generally in this country very particu-

or even one of their cows (1), they put on mourning;
but, as they wear no clothes, this consists simply in
tying a cord across their breast.
