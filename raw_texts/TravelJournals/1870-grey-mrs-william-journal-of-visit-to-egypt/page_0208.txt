 

End of 1/23 Tour. 209

and occupations. Our tour is now a thing of the
past. I can answer for no one but myself; but if
the past four months have been the source of as
much pleasure to others as they have been to me, I
am sure that they will feel the same sorrow that I do
in thinking that they are come to an end.

THE END.
