frightful,°and so was the dancing—of the same na-
ture as that of the harem, consiSting chieﬂy in moving
and shaking the body, the feet and legs having very
little to do with it. Two other small black creatures
afterward appeared, frightful to the highest degree,
but. ' also covered With ornaments. Between the
dances, they sat down on the ﬂoor and smoked ci—
garettes. At 12.30 we came away. '

I forgot to say that, when we ﬁrst arrived, we were
shown several very handsome mummy cases, which
had been found in making the excavations for .the
li’rince. As many as thirty-two have been dug out.

I confess that it went against me to see these things.
To me, what is dead and buried, whatever the custom
or fashion of the burial may be, is sacred; and I can
not bear the idea of disturbing, and still less of re-
moving these corpses, especially when you see, from
the careful way in which they are wrapped up, and
the very out-of-the-way places chosen for their family
tombs, that their wish was to remain there undis-
turbed forever. To break through all the precautions
so carefully and skillfully adopted for concealing their
tombs, and to take out every thing considered most
precious and sacred, and carry them oif, I think sim-
ply horrible. Still, it is done every day, and by the
Viceroy’s order a great many have been taken lately
