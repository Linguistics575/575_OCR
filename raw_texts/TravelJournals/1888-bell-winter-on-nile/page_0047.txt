STUDENTS. 31

 

While we do not stand at the corners of the streets
in prayer,——while, indeed, weare directed to “ go into
our closets, and shut the door about us, and pray to
our Father in secret,”—yet are we ever to “let our
light so shine before men, that they may see our good
works, and glorify our Father who is in heaven.” .
The Prophet did not forbid women to attend public
prayers in a mosque, but . pronounced it better for
them to pray in private. In Cairo, however, neither
females nor young boys are allowed to pray with the
congregation in the mosque, or even to be present
there at any time of prayer. Formerly women were
permitted at such times to enter, but were obliged to
place themselves apart from the men, and behind the
latter, because, as Sale has remarked, “the Moslems
are of opinion that the presence of females inspires
a different kind of devotion from that which is
requisite in a place dedicated to the worship of God.
Very few women in Egypt even pray at home.”1
Mohammedanism, by such exclusion of women from
public worship, and, indeed,‘by its whole treatment
of that sex which was meant by God to be a help-
meet to man, dishonours man and degrades woman,
and destroys the family relations which lie at the
root of national life.
