274 .4 WINTER ON THE NILE.

 

wind sank, and the air grew cooler. About seven
o’clock we ran upon a sandbank, and the boat was
not set free until three o’clock the next morning.
But the delay, and the stillness of the steamer while
she lay wedged in the sand, gave us the opportunity
of examining quietly the largest and most beautiful
halo I ever saw round the moon. That “ orbéd maiden,
with white ﬁre laden,” was surrounded by a luminous
milk-white circle, coloured with all rainbow tints, and
bright with every prismatic hue. The planet herself,
within two days of being at the full, was singularly
brilliant, and the sky was clear and full of stars. The
halo lasted for some time, then very gradually began
to dissolve, then slowly melted away, and the moon
walked on in her glory, and made the night seem but
a paler day. It was pleasant that our last evening on
the Nile should be marked by so lovely a phenomenon,
for in very deed

“ A thing of beauty is a joy for ever ;
Its loveliness increases, it will never
Pass into nothingness, but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.”
