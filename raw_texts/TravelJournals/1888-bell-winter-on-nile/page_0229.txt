a face of much sweetness; the expression is calm
and placid. The head of one of the statues is
broken off, and lies buried in the sand; the other
two are tolerably perfect, but one has lost his beard,
and both of the arms are gone. Notwithstanding
the hard rock from which they are hewn, and the
immense size of the features, the expression of the
mouth and the curves of the nostrils are as delicately
wrought as if they were moulded in marble or in
clay. Certainly the old Egyptians handled their
material with masterly facility, and understood the
nice and difﬁcult art of rendering character and ex-
pression in the face. They evinced not only much
skill, but great artistic excellence in their sculptures.
The statues are naked to the waist, and on their
heads is the crown of Upper and Lower Egypt,
round their necks is a collar cut in relief, and high on
each arm is the royal cartouche. The legs and feet
are in proportion to the immense size of the body,
and the limbs of the shattered Colossus are covered
with inscriptions. On the left leg of this statue is
the famous Greek inscription, dating from the reign
of Psammetichus I., and cut there, just as modern
travellers cut their insigniﬁcant names on rocks and
statues now, and deface them by their tasteless scrawls.
