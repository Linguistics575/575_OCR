hotel, English and American, and some very agree-
able Germans, all of whom contributed to make the
days and evenings pass lightly and happily away.
Many of them were highly-cultured and intelligent,

We made several excursions together, and found,
when visiting the temples and tombs, the truth of the

services for some months, much to the satisfaction of
the visitors. We had a capital musician in a young

and Bach with great power of execution and admir-
able delicacy of touch. Not the least pleasant and
cultured of the guests in the hotel was Canon Isaac
Taylor, who has lately been known as the apologist of
