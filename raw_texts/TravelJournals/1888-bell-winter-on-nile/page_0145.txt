TOAIB 0F REXIIMARA. I29

 

It is known as the tomb of Rekhmara. It was
numbered by Sir G. Wilkinson as tomb 35, and the
number still remains. In the outer chamber there
is a long procession of Ethiopians and Asiatic chiefs,
bearing a tribute to Thothmes III. On a table are
offerings of the precious metals, rings and necklaces,
vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and other costly
ornaments, and the hieroglyphics tell us that they are
“chosen of the chief of the Gentiles of Kufa.” But
not only do they bear with them rich and valuable
gifts, but they also bring with them monkeys, giraffes,
oxen with long horns, leopards, horses and dogs, and
ostrich feathers. Some of the chiefs are black, of the
negro type ; others of a red colour, like the Egyptians,
evidently from the south ; others who are clad in long
white garments are, as their features intimate, from
the north; and some have their hair uncovered, and
others wear a cap which ﬁts close on the head. Some
have long gloves with close sleeves, and are called
Rotennoo (the Assyrians), and behind these are their
wives, dressed in long robes, adorned with three sets
of ﬂounces. It is very difﬁcult, from the nature of the
lights—candles ﬁxed upon long sticks, or now and
then a transient ﬂash from the magnesium wire—to
make out the nature of the different ﬁgures on the
walls; but we were able to see carpenters at work,
