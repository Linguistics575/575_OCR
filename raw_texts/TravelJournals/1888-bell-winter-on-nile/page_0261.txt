RAMESES II. 24 5

 

by himself. He stands colossal in stature on the
. sculptured walls, while all others are dwarfed by his
mighty presence. Some may be affected differently by
these and similar representations; but I confess that,
as regards myself, these gigantic statues, these vast
temples, with their pylons, and columned arches, and
soaring obelisks, and avenues of sphinxes, are more
awe-inspiring than winning, and they crush one with
a sense of insigniﬁcance, and with the terrible power
of the deity who is worshipped in the shrine. Turn-
ing from these symbols of awe and dread, a strange
peace falls on the heart as we call to mind the revela-
tion of Himself by One who makes Himself known as
“the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,” and
who leaves us not to conjecture what His character
may be, but manifests Himself to us as “Love,”
through the incarnation of His only begotten Son.

RAMESES II.

Surely this man did deem himself a god,
Was lifted up with superhuman pride,
As one who was already deiﬁed.

His conquests he had carried far abroad,

And kings and peoples trembled at his nod ;
And so he raised his statues far and wide,
Constructed tombs to hold him when he died,

This great Colossus on the world who trod.
