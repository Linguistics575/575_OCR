96 A WINTER ON THE NILE.

 

Leaving the terrace with reluctance, and with one
more look at the temple, we again mount our donkeys,
and return to the boat. That evening, as we steam
to Luxor, we see the great temple of Karnak in the
distance, and presently the grand ruined temple of
Luxor lines the shore, and the good ship Rameses
is to anchor here till Friday. The three days dur-
ing which the large steamers remain here give the
passengers the opportunity of seeing the Theban
Valley, with its temples and tombs, the two magni-
ﬁcent Colossi, as well as the temples of Luxor and
Karnak; but three days is but a short time for all
these wonderful monuments of Egypt’s ancient glory;
and I was glad to take up my quarters at the Luxor
Hotel for a month, after coming back from Wady
Halfa. This month gave me full opportunity of
visiting the valley of the Tombs of the Kings, and
some of the grandest ruins in the world ; and I made
as much use as possible of the weeks spent there to
inspect scenes so deservedly famous. I shall there-
fore at once mention the impression they made on
me, and refer to the life at Luxor when I speak of
my return to the place from the Nubian frontier.

The city of Thebes was built on both sides of the
Nile, just as London is built on both sides of the
Thames, or Paris on both sides of the Seine.
