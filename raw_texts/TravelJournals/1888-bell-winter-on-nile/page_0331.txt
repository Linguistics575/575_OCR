THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION. 315

 

of matter themselves assume. Life can only be im-
parted by One who is Himself living; and the laws
of matter cannot have originated in matter itself; it
needed a living Being to impart life, and a sentient
Being to impress on matter its forces and its laws.
And therefore we are compelled to believe that this
wonderful thing which we call life must have been
imparted to man and to the animal world by a First
Great Cause, who is the Author and Giver of life, as
well as of every other good and perfect gift. Some,
I am aware, believe that evolution is consistent with
revelation, or at least with the argument from design.
For them it may be easy to accept the unproved and,
I must say, to me, untenable scientiﬁc hypothesis that
man has been spontaneously evolved out of the
monera ; for me it is much less difﬁcult to receive the
account of his origin as stated in Genesis, that “ God
created man in His own image, in the image of God
created He him, male and female created He them.”
It is pleasant to leave the search after the origin of
man in animals of a low simian type, and to come to
the Bible story of his creation, and to see him walking
with God in the garden of the Lord. Man I believe
to be directly God-created, not ape-descended. His
origin is sublime, and his destiny glorious; and I
summon the very stones in the temple-walls of Egypt
