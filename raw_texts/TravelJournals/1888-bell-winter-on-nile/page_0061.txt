RA MESES 11. 4 5

 

the longer period allowed by the Septuagint, which
places the creation of man RC. 5400, and the shorter
system of the Hebrew text, which places it 1,400
years later. We must not form a hasty judgment on
this vexed question, but wait until further light is
thrown on the whole subject. It is a happy thing
that the truth of the Bible does not depend on
chronology,—that the witness to its history and doc-
trines is unassailable, and that it fears no discoveries
from any of the sciences, so that we may rest calm in
the assurance that heaven and earth shall pass away,
but that the words of this Book shall never pass
away.

RAMESES II. ‘(Bou/ci’é Musemn).

I stand and gaze upon thy mummied face,
Thou who didst deem thyself a demi-god,
Before whom monarchs paled, and kings were awed,—
Thou greatest scion of a royal race,
Lying so still within death’s grim embrace.
And art thou he who carried wars abroad,
Who shook the trembling nations with thy nod,
And brought them to thy feet to pray for grace?

Did Moses look into that face so cold,

Those eyes so vacant, and that form so still?
What ! Did be brave thee in the days of old,
Defying in God’s name thy passionate will,

Which in hard bondage did the Hebrews hold,
Till life was death, and death itself no ill?
