240,000 Egyptians who, Herodotus relates, deserted
because they were kept in garrison at Syene for three
years without being relieved.1 Can it be that the
Egyptian deserters numbered so many, or is this an

Greek inscriptions at Aboo Simbel, are “the oldest
existing, ” Murray tells us, “to which a date can be
given, and have been of the greatest use in the study
of the history of the Greek alphabet. They were
written in the 7th century B.C.” It cannot be said of
many modern travellers who write their names, or
cut their initials on temples or tombs, that they leave
behind them a record which shall be of interest and

use to the future historian.
