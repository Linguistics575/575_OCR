PARTIAL DESTRUCTION 0F TEMPLE. 95

 

face is coloured in yellow, the ground of the tableau
being blue. A great part of the temple is in ruins,
and the havoc wrought on- the pylon and the sacred
places is no doubt the work of the early Christians,
who, in their iconoclastic zeal, mutilated this and other
sacred places which, but for their iconoclasm, might
have remained perfect to the present day. While we
acknowledge their zeal for God, we cannot but mourn
over its result. The wild bees, too, have done much
mischief to the carvings and sculptures on the walls.
They have covered the hieroglyphics and ﬁgures with
innumerable mud cells. These destructive bees are
larger than our hive bees, and are very pretty insects;
their head and breast is of an orange colour, and the
abdomen is of a glossy black. They have destroyed
much of the decorative work on the temple walls.
You ascend by a richly sculptured staircase on the
northern side, on which is seen a procession of priests,
with the king at their head, to the terraced roof,
from whence you obtain a ﬁne view of the valley, and
the distant hills glowing in the sunlight, and where
the shadows fall, taking all tender tints of violet, and
rose, and blue. The plain between you and the hill
is green with lentils and springing corn, and bean
ﬁelds, through which the river, like a thread of silver,
takes its fertilizing and beneﬁcent course.
