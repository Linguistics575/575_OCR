APPENDIX. 335

 

The nights are often cold, as low as 40°. The
average diurnal range for the three months 'was
28°5°, but it was often much more than this. On
thirteen occasions it amounted to 30° and up-
wards; on six occasions to 35° and upwards; and
once to 43°.

The coldest time in the twenty-four hours is always
at night, between three and four o’clock in the morn-
ing. It is unsafe for invalids and delicate peoPIe to
have their windows Open all night.

The khamseen blows from the south or south-west,
and scorches like the blast of a'furnace, and brings
with it clouds of ﬁne dust and sand. Guide-books
say it rarely comes on till April ; but it often begins
in February, usually in March (as this year), and lasts
ﬁfty days, as its name implies. It- blows at intervals,
there being cooler days between. Residents say that
May and June are delightful. The most equable and
delicious climate is at Luxor. Assouan is intolerably
hot, hotter than Wady Halfa, 200 miles farther
south, and Within the tropics; no doubt because of
the hills which surround Assouan on all sides. The
Nile water should be boiled and ﬁltered, otherwise
there is a risk of diarrhoea and zymotic disease.
