10 A HUNTER ON THE NILE.

 

A

new constellation, in the sky. They pointed to a
cluster of stars which they now separated from Leo ;
and the king, who perhaps had not been an observer
of the heavens, or who was pleased with the expla-
nation of the theft, was satisﬁed, and the constellation
shines still in the sky.

BERENICE’S HAIR.

The hour had come for them to part,
The king must leave for Syrian shore,
And so he caught her to his heart,
And kissed her sweet lips o’er and o’er.

Her head within both hands he took,
With all its wealth of golden hair,
Bright as the ripened corn that shook,
And rippled in the summer air :

“ 0 love, dear love,” he fondly cried,
“’Tis death in life to part from thee ! ”

She, smiling through her tears, replied,
“ My heart will follow after thee.

“Thou know’st full well it is not mine,
It left this bosom long ago,

T is thine, dear love, and only thine,
In life or death, in weal or woe.”

One last embrace, he left the room;
One lingering look, he passed away ;
The sunlight darkened into gloom,
A cloud fell on the cloudless day.
