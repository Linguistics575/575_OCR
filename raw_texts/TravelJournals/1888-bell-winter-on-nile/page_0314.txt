not to be put aside hastily and without thought. Mr.
Cope Whitehouse, who is full of enthusiasm, is widely
known from a scheme which he has submitted to the

Fayoum, which, at high Nile, shall store the super-
abundance of the water, and allow it to be utilized for
irrigation when the river is low. Iwas present at a
lecture he gave on the subject, in which he detailed his
plan, and explained its feasibility. Herodotus mentions
the existence of Lake Moeris, and says : “It is yet more
astonishing than the labyrinth which is close by.”
“ The water in this lake does not spring from the soil,
for these parts are- excessively dry ; but it is conveyed
through a channel from the Nile, and for six months
it ﬂows into the lake, and six months out again into
the Nile.” And Strabo, some 400 years later, speaking
of Lake Moeris, says: “ The Lake Moeris, by its mag-
nitude and depth, is able to sustain the superabun-
dance of water, which ﬂows into it at the time of the
rise of the river, without overﬂowing the inhabited
and cultivated parts of the country. On the decrease
of the water of the river, it distributes the excess by
the same canal at each of the mouths; and both the
lake and the canal preserve a remainder, which is
used for irrigation.” Mr. Cope Whitehouse states
