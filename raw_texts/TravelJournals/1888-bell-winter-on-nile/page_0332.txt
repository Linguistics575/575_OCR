missing links still unknown to science. That man,
with his physical peculiarities and high spiritual en-

accidentally from any inferior animal known to us, is
simply incredible.” If the doctrine of evolution were
true, surely man’s progress would not have come to a

years ago; it would have continued since then, and
there would be proofs that his physical and spiritual
development had never been interrupted. But though
attempts have been made to give a series of the an-
