SCULPTURE 0F SHISHANK. 103

 

gloriﬁed himself, as though he were a god. It is
said that the overthrow of this incomparable temple
was due to an earthquake; and that Cambyses, the
ﬁerce and fanatical Persian, and Ptolemy Lathyrus
only completed the destruction which had been
begun by some terrible convulsion of nature. What-
ever was the cause, the temple, with its famous
hypostyle hall, which Fergusson calls “the greatest
of man’s architectural works,” is now but a majestic
ruin. It was once, as Dean Stanley says, “the
grandest building which the world ever raised to the
glory and worship of God.” He also speaks-of it as
“the oldest consecrated place of worship in the
world,” and says, “ the principles of religious art ﬁrst
appeared here, and have never since been lost.” On
the southern wall, beyond the Osiride ﬁgure, muti-
lated and maimed—beyond the sanctuary, there is a
sculpture of the greatest interest, and which has a
reference to Bible history. Shishank—the Shishak of
the Bible—and one of the last of the Pharaohs, who
for more than a thousand years had assisted in build-
' ing Karnak, like other great conquerors, left cut in
the stone a record of his conquests. There you see
him leading captive the representatives of more than
thirty nations whom he had subdued, and the name

of each is written in hieroglyphics on a cartouche.
