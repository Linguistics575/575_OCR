scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner of vessels
of ivory, and all kinds of most precious wood, and
brass and iron and marble, and cinnamon, and odours,
and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil,
and ﬁne ﬂour and wheat, and cattle, and sheep, and
horses, and chariots and slaves.” On the Nile are

rowers ; and as the queen or some noble lady glides

Burned on the water; the poop was beaten gold,
Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
The winds were love-sick with them ; the oars were silver,
Which to the tune of lutes kept stroke.”
