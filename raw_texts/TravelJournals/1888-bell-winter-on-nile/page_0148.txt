132 A WINTER ON THE NILE.

 

pictured scenes and literary remains assure us, but
that they were a light-hearted, pleasure-loving people
is evident from such sculptured incidents as those
described, and also from the account of them given
by Herodotus. He tells us that “they hold public
festivals, not only once in a year, but several times,”
and he gives us a description of a feast held in honour
of Diana in the city of Bubastis. “Now, when they
are being conveyed to the city Bubastis, they act as
follows: for men and women embark together, and
great numbers of both sexes in every barge ; some of
the women have castanets on which they play, and
the men play on the ﬂute during the whole voyage,
the rest of the women and men sing and clap their
hands together at the same time. When in the course
of their passage they come to any town, they lay their
barge near to land, and do as follows: some of the
women do as I have described, others shout and scoff
at the women of the place; some dance, and others
.stand up and pull Up their clothes; this they do at
every town at the river-side. When they arrive at
Bubastis, they celebrate the feast, offering up great
sacriﬁces, and more wine is consumed at this festival
than in all the rest of the year. What with men and
women, beside children, they congregate, as the in-
habitants say, to the number of 700,000.”
