APPENDIX.

AM indebted to Thomas D. Saville, M.D., M.R.C.P.,
I whose acquaintance I had the pleasure of making
in Egypt, for the following observations on the climate
on the Nile during the months of winter. They may
be of interest to those who intend to spend the winter
in that most interesting and delightful country.

Egypt has longer periods of ﬁne weather than
almost any winter climate. A high and steady
barometer is generally supposed to be indicative of
ﬁne weather. But by readings in January, February,
and March, on only six occasions did it reach or
exceed 30 inches, and it only once reached 3015.
The explanation of this is the remarkable dryness of
the air.

In January, the highest maximum temperature was
77°, the lowest minimum 40° (two readings during the
night); the average maximum 703°, the average
minimum 472. The average temperature of the

month 60°. (Note—All temperature readings are on
33I
