SUNSET ON THE" NILE. 105

 

SUNSET ON THE NILE.

The sun in setting smites that river old,
Which rolls through Egypt with life-giving flow ; -
At once the placid waters gleam and glow,

And glisten like a sheet of burnished gold,

Bright as the sands o’er which Pactolus rolled,
In the far-distant ages long ago ;

But as I gaze, the splendour fades, and lo !

I wake to ﬁnd the world grown dark and cold.

Yet now the night draws on with moon and star
That ﬁll with liquid light the purple skies ;
And Venus burns in beauty from afar,
And Sirius leans out from his silver car,
While Mars looks down with red and ﬁery eyes,
As though he’d gird himself afresh for war.
