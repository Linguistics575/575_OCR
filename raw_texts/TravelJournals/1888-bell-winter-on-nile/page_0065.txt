THE GREAT PYRAMID. 49

 

Pyramid, to say that it is ﬁfty feet higher than the
dome of St. Paul’s, and more than twice as high as
the central tower of York Minster. The area that it
covers is equal to the area of Lincoln’s Inn Fields,
and it is computed to have contained 6,848,000 tons
of solid masonry. It may be asked, “What was the
motive of these stupendous monuments?” Some,
like Mr. Piazzi Smyth, have given them an astro-
nomical intention, and have constructed from them
an elaborate scheme by which they endeavour to
prove that the Great Pyramid of Ghizeh was intended
to “perpetuate a knowledge of scientiﬁcally ascer-
tained natural standards of weight, measure, and
capacity.” But Mariette and other learned Egypto-
logists have come to the conclusion that the Pyra-
mids, great and small, “were tombs, massive, entire,
everywhere hermetically sealed, even in their most
carefully constructed passages ; without windows, with-
out doors, without external openings of any kind.”
Inside the Great Pyramid is a series of “ inextric-
able passages and rooms.” These were intended to
deceive any who might wish in the future to violate
the pyramid, and ﬁnd the royal mummy; for the
various chambers and corridors, the blocks of granite
barring the way, the mysterious well, the object of
which was a puzzle to the discoverers, were all meant
