A IVINTEA’ ON THE NILE.

Or did they mock her anxious cares,
The tears that from her eyes would ﬂow?

She sought once more the sacred fane,

Where priests in fair white robes were drest,
And there she knelt and vowed again

To sacriﬁce what she held best.

She loosed the ﬁllet from her hair,

Its fragrance made the day more sweet,
And sunshine seemed to ﬁll the air,

As showered the ringlets to her feet.

“ I dedicate this hair,” she said,
“Which Euergetes praised as mine,
The glory of my woman’s head,
And lay it on this holy shrine.”

The priest took in his hand the knife,

The hair gleamed brighter than the sun,
Up in his eyes then smiled the wife,

As fell the tresses one by one.

She hung the votive offering fair
Within the inner sacred shrine ;
So brightly gleamed the golden hair,

It made the temple walls to shine.

“ Accept this offering,” she said,
“ O’er Euergetes cast your shield,
Protect and guard his noble head,
Send him victorious from the ﬁeld.”

The gods smiled on her from above,
They listened to her pleading cry ;

And pleased with this new proof of love,
They took the tresses to the sky.
