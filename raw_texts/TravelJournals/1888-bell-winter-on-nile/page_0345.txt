bazaars, its pleasant drives, and the ever-varying
kaleidoscope of colour which is always a delight to

who added so much, by their kindness, to the enjoy-

and majestic temples, its ancient tombs and colossal
statues ; the glory of its sunsets, the splendour of its
after-glows ; its stately palms, and the changing light
on river and desert and plain. It is all like a dream
now, but not a dream which one awakes only to
forget, but a dream which, like “ a thing of beauty, is
a joy for ever,” and has enriched the memory for all

the, coming years.
