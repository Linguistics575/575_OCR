“ cafes,” and take part in those wild orgies known as
a “fantasia.”

One other place we visited at Luxor was the English.
burying-ground. It is a dreary, arid, barren spot,
surrounded by a mud wall, one tomb lying outside
the enclosure. Among others, a brother of Sir Wile
frid Lawson’s lies here, and the wife of Sir Valentine
Baker. It was painful to see the sandy, neglected,
ugly appearance of the little cemetery ; great was the
contrast it presented to an English village church-
yard, with its spreading yews, and dark green
cypresses, and well-tended smooth turf. I was glad
to ﬁnd that an effort was being made by the English
visitors to put the place in order, and to make pro-
vision for its being well kept in the future, and it was
with more than satisfaction that I pleaded at one of '
the Sunday services in the hotel that the offertory
should be devoted to this purpose. A considerable
sum was the result. If the friends of those who lie
in that repulsive cemetery knew of its condition,I
believe they would gladly help to put it in order, and
to give it an aspect more in accordance with that
bright hope which the Christian has when he lays his
dead in the grave.
