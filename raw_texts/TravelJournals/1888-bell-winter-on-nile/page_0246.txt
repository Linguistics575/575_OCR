230 A WINTER ON THE NILE.

 

such a splendour on the Nile! The west was all
aﬂame, and the gorgeous colours were reﬂected in the
water, making a double glory: the heavens a roof
of burnished gold, the waters a floor of amber and
emerald and blue. And then the lights gradually
faded, and the darkness came on, and the beauty
passed away, only to be succeeded by beauty of
another kind—by luminous stars that looked down
with lustrous eyes, and ﬁlled the tranquil evening
with their silver light. Some of the party got up
early the next morning to visit the tombs recently
discovered by Sir Richard Grenfell, before the steam-
boat left Assouan ; but as I had some hopes of return-
ing to the frontier town of Egypt, and occupying a
house, which one of the oﬁiccrs kindly placed at our
disposal for a short time, I did not accompany them,
and so lost the opportunity of seeing the tombs, which
well repaid the effort of- an early visit, and a some-
what steep climb to reach them.

We dropped anchor at Luxor the same evening,
and in the morning left the Multan-2mm! Ali for the
‘Luxor Hotel, where, fortunately, we had secured
rooms two months before, for there were many
travellers, and some friends who had come down with
us in the steamer were obliged to seek accommoda-
tion at a smaller hotel, the Karnak.
