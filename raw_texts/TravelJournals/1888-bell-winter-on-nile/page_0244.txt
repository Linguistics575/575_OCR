228 A WINTER ON THE NILE.

 

so, still keeping ahead, we were carried past the
island of Elephantine, and with a run and a rush
found ourselves at last under the Moorish ruin at
Assouan.

NEAR KOROSKO.

The day is perfect, cool, and passing fair :
The boat upon the river glideth calm,
Past golden sands, green banks, and graceful palm ;
Such beauty is there in the earth and air,
As well might loose “the ravelled sleeve of care,”
And shed upon the wounded spirit balm,
. Or strike the keynote of a holy psalm,
Or lift the soul to God in happy prayer.

T o breathe at all this day is passing sweet,

To gaze on earth, to look upon the sky.
The hours are winged with pinions all too fleet,
For 10, as if to make the joy complete,

Two heavens are ours—one shining far on high,
One in the river ﬂowing at our feet.
