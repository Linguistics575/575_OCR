HE beautiful temple of Denderah is dedicated to

Hathor, the Egyptian Venus, and the nurse of
' Horus, son of Osiris and Isis, and is comparatively
modern, belonging to the period of the Ptolemies and
the Caesars. Every temple or tomb in Egypt that
does not date from three or four thousand years
before Christ is considered modern, and therefore is
not stamped with that seal of antiquity which in the
eyes of many gives a value to a building beyond any
other. Antiquity has its interest, but so has beauty ;
and the works of the Ptolemies and the Caesars are
not to be passed by with a sneer because compara-

Cleopatra, and not ﬁnished till the reign of Nero.
Belzoni extols it as the most magniﬁcent he had seen,
