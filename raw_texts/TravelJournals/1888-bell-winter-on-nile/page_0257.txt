ANTIQ UES. 241

 

antiques are sold, but antiques are made. There are
' men there who drive a thriving trade in forged
Scarabs and amulets, and ﬁgures of the gods in bronze
and china; and you are beset with men and boys
who offer these things for sale, and declare them to be
genuine and thousands of years old. 80 well are
many of these things made that it needs the practised
eye of a connoisseur to detect the fraud, and it is
expedient that the buyer should have a well-qualiﬁed
opinion before he invests in a sacred beetle or a god.
The three consuls stationed at Luxor keep in their
consulates a variety of antiques for sale, and I believe
they are to be trusted. The German consul has a-
very good collection, from which I selected some that
those learned in such matters have assured me are
genuine. There are also shops in the town where
antiques found by the Arabs in the tombs and temples
may be had; and I have seen some beautiful ala-
baster vases, and. scarabs for rings, and cornelian
necklaces that were purchased from 'these dealers,
who are very secret about their most valuable wares,
only showing them to you when you are alone. If
it was known that they had such treasures, it might
lead to awkward discoveries. While I was at Luxor,
M. Grebaut came from Cairo to superintend some
excavations that were being carried on in the temple
