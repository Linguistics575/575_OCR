state of uncertainty, and cannot be settled with our
present means of information. Manetho, a priest
under the ﬁrst two Ptolemies, between 300 and 250
years B.C., wrote in Greek a history of the Pharaohs,
from the sacred records of Heliopolis. Some frag-
ments of this history, and a catalogue of thirty royal
dynasties, from Mena, or Menes, down to Nectanebo,
who lived, according to Brugsch, B.C. 378, have been
preserved through Josephus. The Egyptians them-
selves make extravagant claims to antiquity. Hero-
dotus, who visited Egypt about 450 years B.C., tells
us, in his interesting history, that the priests at that
time claimed for their nation, from their ﬁrst king,
Mena, to Seti the First, an existence of 234 genera-
tions, or more than 11,000 years; and he says that
during this time “no god had ever appeared in
human form;” and beyond this Mena, was the
mythical age of the gods. Some believe that Mena
himself was a mythical personage, a personiﬁcation
of the two Misors, the Hebrew Misraim, or provinces
of Upper and Lower Egypt. Indeed, chronology is
in such‘ an uncertain condition that Egyptian scholars
vary in their estimates as much as 3,000 years,—the
ﬁrst Pharaoh, Mena, according to Boeckh, lived
5702 B.C.; according to Rawlinson, 2450. As to
Bible chronology, theologians are divided between
