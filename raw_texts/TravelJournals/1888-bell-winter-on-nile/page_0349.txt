677°. There were two showers, each of a few
minutes’ duration, at Luxor in February ; but between
February Ist and March 11th there were only six
days which were more or less cloudy ; the remaining
thirty-three were bright and sunny. The prevailing
winds were northerly—fresh during February, and
stormy during March. There were two days of
moderate khamseen, or desert wind, in February, and
two in the early part of March. The average fall at
sundown was 3'8°. In February and the early part of
March the highest recorded percentage humidity was
80° (at Ayat, just above Cairo) ; but there were four
times when the percentage was about 60. The lowest
recorded was 24, but there were thirteen occasions
when it went below 40. The average percentage
humidity during that period, when ﬁfty-three observa-
tions were made at all hours of the day, was 495°.
' During the three months I spent in Egypt, there
were only three showery days, and only three others
on which a few drops of rain fell, not amounting to
a shower. At Luxor, no shower had fallen since July
I Ith, 1887. There were upwards of sixty-ﬁve days in
three months when the sun was not obscured by cloud.
The mean temperature for this space of time was
651 Fahr., which corresponds approximately to the
July and August average in and near London.
