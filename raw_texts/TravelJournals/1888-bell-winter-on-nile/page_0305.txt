causeth thee to ﬂow, we implore God, the One, the
Mighty, to make thee ﬂow!’ Amr did as he was
commanded, and the Nile, we are told, rose sixteen
cubits in the following night.”

for the Fellaheen. No ploughing or harrowing is
needed; they have only to “cast their bread ”—their
seed-corn—“ upon the waters,” and afterwards to
bury it by means of toothless rakes, or palm-branches
