SOLOZIION’S TEACHING. I47

 

 

 

suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption. Thou wilt
show me the path of life : in Thy presence is fulness
of joy; at Thy right hand there are pleasures for
evermore.”

Solomon, who shows us “the vanity” of things here,
and “the vexation of spirit” which accompanies even
the most coveted things of this earth, cannot be said,
as I have seen it stated by Zincké in his suggestive
book on Egypt, to pass over the future life, “as not
thinking it worth even a passing reference.” If in
times of mental gloom and despondency, natural to a
man who had lived so much for this present world, its
pomps, and pleasures, and enjoyments, he says, “ For
to him that is joined to all the living there is a hope ;
for a living dog is better than'a dead lion; for the
living know that they shall die, but the dead know not
anything, neither have they any more a reward, for
the memory of them is forgotten,” at another time
he speaks clearly of a future state for man, and of
judgment to come; for he winds up the sad book of
Ecclesiastes, full as it is of doubts and'questionings,
with this distinct statement, which surely has a bear-
ing on the sanctions of another life: ‘ For God shall
bring every work into judgment, with every secret
thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil”
(Eccles. xii. I4).
