'x 12 .4 WINTER ON THE NILE.

 

“Ka.” When the spiritual body moved abroad, and
was tortured by hunger or thirst, it had often to.
feed on garbage in order to support life. To preserve
the “ Ka” from death, offerings of fruit, and wine, and
meat, are represented on the chambers of the tombs.
The soul, which was also supposed to be mortal, had
similar offerings of food and drink, and selected from
them what it pleased. Both the “ Ba ” and the “ Ka ”
had a shade, which also subsisted on the table of
offerings, which was placed in the antechamber.
Sometimes the bread and wine, instead of being
given to the dead, were presented to the gods, who
from their own hands gave them to the mummy.
We learn from their conception of the “ Ba” and the
“ Ka,” did we not learn it elsewhere, that the ancient
Egyptians distinctly recognised the immortality of '
the soul and the resurrection of the body. We also
ﬁnd from the Ritual of the Dead that they believed
in a judgment to come ; for not only is the judgment
of the soul seen in the sculptures on the walls of the
tombs, but in the rolls of papyrus found in the cofﬁn
with the mummy, the course of the spirit after death
is traced to the world of recompense or retribution.
This we shall consider by-and-by. Let us wait no
longer outside the Tombs of the Kings, but enter, and
see their wonders.
