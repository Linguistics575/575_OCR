CHAPTER XXVI.

On Shore Again.—-—Sunset.—Cook, and Egyptian Tourists—Life
at Luxor.—Enjoyable Climate—Loss of Chameleon.—
Glorious Sunsets.—“ The After-Glow.”

HE steamer, the Mo/zammed Ali, was in the

harbour waiting to receive us; and after an
inspection of our cabins, I went on shore to have
another look at the bazaars, and to make some
further purchases of baskets, and whips, and knives
of the country. I paid a visit to the American
Mission Schools, which are here under a native
teacher, and which are doing good work in the
education of the young, the Scriptures being taught
to all the children who attend. The English oﬁicers
kindly brought a pretty little grey horse, which one
of my daughters mounted, and under their escort she
rode into the desert and saw the Besharine camp, and
then had a gallop up to the fort, from which she
had a splendid view of the setting sun. As seen also
from the deck of the Mo/zammed Ali, the sunset was
glorious. Such colours in earth, and air, and sky!
