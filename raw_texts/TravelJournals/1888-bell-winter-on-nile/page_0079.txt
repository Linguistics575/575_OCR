MITRAHENNY. 63

 

was the long outline of the Mokattam hills. On the
western shore rose the Pyramids, apparently only a
short distance off, though in fact some miles inter-
vened, so clear and transparent was the air. Our ﬁrst
excursion from the boat was made from Bedreshein,
where the boat halted, in order that the passengers
might visit Mitrahenny and Sakkarah. We found
donkeys and men awaiting us, and mounting, we rode
through the village of Mitrahenny, situated on an
arid mound, blocks of granite being scattered here
and there, and the foundations of old walls appearing
through the surface of the soil; these, and a hollow
space, once the site of the temple of Phtah, the Greek
Vulcan, with some crumbling bricks and broken
pottery, being all that remains of the once magniﬁ-
cent Memphis, the chief city of Egypt, and the
residence of the Pharaohs. The splendour of this
ancient capital has departed, the glory of its palaces
and temples is no more. Who can ride through
the palm groves which cast their cool shadows over
these crumbling mounds, the only vestiges of its
former greatness, and not recall the words of the
prophet Jeremiah ?——“O thou daughter dwelling in
Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity: for N oph
(Memphis) shall be waste and desolate without an
inhabitant ” (Jer. xlvi. 19).
