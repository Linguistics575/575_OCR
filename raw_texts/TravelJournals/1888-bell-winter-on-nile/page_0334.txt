318 A HUNTER ON THE NILE.

 

nation, refutes this idea ; and her majestic monuments
with their frescoes and sculptures, through which we .
read the daily life of the king, the priests, and the
people, prove that in the times nearest to the creation
of man she had attained to a higher condition of I
importance and greatness than she has ever attained
since. Hers is a development of degeneration. The
descendants of this wonderful people, in outward
appearance resembling the men we see in the sculp-
tures and has-reliefs on the monuments, can do no-
thing like them now, and cannot build or paint or
write as their fathers builded and painted and wrote,
cannot model the colossal statue or raise the magniﬁ-
cent pyramid. They have retrograded rather than
advanced. They have lost the power of doing such
works ; their evolution is from higher to lower.

Let me conﬁrm this opinion by a sentence from
Miss Martineau’s Eastern Life, Past and Present.
In speaking of the glories of the temple at Karnak,
she says :-“ Here was enthroned the human intellect
when humanity was elsewhere scarcely emerging
from chaos. And how was it now? That morning
I had seen the governor of Thebes, crouching on his
haunches on the ﬁlthy shore among the dung-heaps,
feeding himself with his ﬁngers, among a circle of
apish creatures like himself.”
