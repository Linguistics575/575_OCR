which covers the whole valley; when the Delta is
turned into a vast lake, and towns and villages are
like islands__in the tumultuous waters, which rise to the
top of the natural banks, and ﬂow along the base of
the artiﬁcial dykes by which the natural banks are
crossed. Well might Jeremiah compare the invasion
