30 A WINTER ON THE NILE.

 

roof. These, though they seem out of character with
the building, and give it something of the appearance
of a furniture shop, no doubt have a ﬁne effect when
the mosque is lighted for evening prayer. The
mosque of Mohammed Ali is built in the Byzantine
style, and contains the tomb of the founder. It is
spacious and handsome, the outer court is of white
marble, and the interior and the dome are effectively
painted. The gallery is supported by columns of
alabaster, but the mosque has no historical interest,
and fails in impressing the imagination. I have seen
. many Moslems at prayer in their mosques and else-
where, in the street, or the deck of the boat, where
they spread out their prayer-carpet, and make their
prostrations, indifferent to the presence of spectators.
Prayer is with them a matter of prescribed words
and postures, and seems to have nothing of the
spontaneous utterance of the heart. They do not
approach God through a Mediator; and I question
whether they have any conception of sin, or of
their need of forgiveness. Islam seems very much a
.religion of form without power,—of washings, and
fastings, and festivals,—of that “bodily exercise”
which “ proﬁteth little.” We may certainly learn from
them the lesson of not being ashamed of our religion,
and of the duty of confessing Christ before men.
