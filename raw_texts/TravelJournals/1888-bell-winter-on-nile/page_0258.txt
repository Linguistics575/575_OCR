242 A WINTER ON THE NILE.

 

there, in order to give employment to some of the
people who had suffered from the inundation of the
Nile, which had been unusually high the last year,
and had done much damage to the town and neigh-
bourhood. M. Grebaut made a raid on the shops
where antiques were sold, and carried off to his
dahabeah all the treasures he could ﬁnd, much to
the distress of the owners, for they had purchased
them from well-known seekers for hid treasure, and
they received no compensation for their loss. This
seemed somewhat hard, though doubtless the dealers
must have known that they were engaged in an
illegal trade. However, the houses of the consuls
were not entered, and they were permitted, for
obvious reasons, to retain their goods in peace. As
M. Grebaut was sent by the Government, the Boulak
Museum would be all the richer for his raid upon
the sh0ps. We went with the English consul on
board the dahabeah, to which the discovered treasures
were conveyed ; and M. Grebaut, with great courtesy,
allowed us to see them all, and pointed out the most
valuable objects—mummy-cases, votive statuettes,
wood carvings, blue scarabs, and precious amulets—
and told us with grim satisfaction of the success
of his search among the dealers at Luxor, some of
whom were much the poorer since his arrival.
