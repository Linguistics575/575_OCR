ASSOUAN. 173

 

well there, into which the sun was said to shine at the
summer solstice, sending his rays perpendicularly
into it, and illuminating it in every part, and the
sun was said to ﬁt the well like the cover of a vessel.”

Assouan is the frontier town of Egypt proper.
Here another country begins. It was interesting to
go on shore, and to ﬁnd one’s self among a crowd of
Nubians and Egyptians, negroes and Bedouins. The
Nubians are a ﬁne-looking race, black as night, but
well formed, and with intelligent faces. The shore
was lined with pe0ple selling their wares—elephants’
tusks, and ostrich feathers, ornaments of silver and
glass, pikes and lances,‘ and arrows, the points of
which are said to be poisoned, and whips made of
hippopotamus hide. There were camels and donkeys
on the bank all ready saddled, and only waiting for
riders; and very soon I saw gentlemen and ladies
mounted on “ the ship of the desert,” looking anxious
and uncomfortable, and, if one might judge from
their appearance, feeling insecure. They did not
trust themselves wholly to the snarling beasts, but ,
had a man or boy to lead the animal. Instead of
trading on the shore, I walked under the shadow of
some ﬁne acacia trees, and past some coffee-shops,
and through a narrow lane, under the escort of a half-
naked black boy, to the only bazaar in the town.
