104 A WINTER ON THE NILE.

 

He holds by the hair a group of captives, distinctly
Jewish in feature, and Judah is mentioned among the
vanquished nations. We turn to the sacred history, and
light is thrown on the sculptures at once. In the Ist
Book of Kings, 14th chapter and 25th verse, we read :
“In the ﬁfth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak, king
of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem.” We have
the same record in 2 Chronicles xii. 39. On the
wall on which this interesting sculpture is seen, but
some way to the east, we see cut into the stone the
celebrated poem of Pentaour, a poet at the court of
Rameses II.

Having examined these interesting records of a
remote period, we rode through a mass of broken
columns and mounds of brick, past a little lake, fed
by the Nile through the soil which is charged with
saltpetre, and the waters of which are salt and unﬁt for
use, and came to the long avenue of broken sphinxes,
some of them with human heads, others with the
head of a ram, and which once extended to the banks
of the Nile. We then visited the ruins of the temple
of Maut, the divine mother, and rode back through
the ﬁelds, and by the houses that fringe the village,
to the hotel.
