192 A WINTER ON THE NILE.

 

New York and Chicago, eats, drinks, and sleeps, and
transacts all his business in the train. He never
leaves his carriage, but makes it his home.

On Tuesday, the 17th of January, we left Kalabsheh
early in the morning, with the melancholy sound of
the shadoof in our ears. It had been droning and
creaking during the night, and its moaning seemed
to mingle with our dreams. In a short time we
entered the Tropic of Cancer, and so passing quietly
along reached Dendoor, where there is a pylon and
a small temple of the Roman period, dedicated to
Osiris, Isis, and Horus. The people of the village
crowded round us, begging us to buy their wares-—
the usual necklaces, and beads, and bracelets—and
clamouring for backsheesh. The scenery is wild
and stem, relieved only by the bright green of the
river bank, and the silver windings of the Nile. Some
purple hills rise in the distance, and the sand is
literally golden, bright and beautiful, and of a colour
more lovely than I had yet seen. I understood, as
I had not done up till now, the meaning of the phrase

“ golden sands.”
I The walk to Dendoor was taken before breakfast,
for which it had given us an appetite on our return
to the 5323i. The Nile now increases in breadth, and
the scenery assumes a new and singular character.
