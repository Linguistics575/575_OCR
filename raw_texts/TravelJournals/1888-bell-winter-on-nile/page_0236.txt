220 A WINTER ON THE NILE.

 

plantations of the castor-oil shrub, with a glow of
beauty upon all. As the day was hot, we were full
of hope that we should'see a crocodile; and, 10! as
we sailed quietly along, and were approaching a sand-
bank, the captain came with the intelligence that
there was a huge creature basking high and dry in
the sun. There was a general excitement. All
rushed to the western side of the boat, and over
there, on a bank of sand, lay what appeared to be
a dark log of wood. “Where is the crocodile?”
“Yonder,” said the captain, pointing to the log.
“ You are jesting,” was the reply; “ that is only the
trunk of a tree; it cannot be a crocodile.” “We
shall see,” said he. Upon which he clapped his
hands, and raised a shout; the brown log moved,
stirred, awoke from its happy slumber and pleasant
dreams, and running down the sloping bank, disap-
peared quietly in the water. I never thought that
a crocodile could run so swiftly, but had fancied they
were slow in movement, and that they turned them-
selves round with difﬁculty ; but I believe these ideas
must be remanded to the region of myths. I may
say here that two more crocodiles were seen in our
passage to Korosko, and that our desire to see these
creatures, once the object of worship, was fully
gratiﬁed.
