of his meritorious deeds, and the assurances of his
ﬁtness to stand before Osiris. Thoth, the ‘god of
letters, carries in his hand a tablet, on which the
actions of the deceased are noted down ; and one of.
the ministers of Thoth, in the form of an ape, and
whose name is Hap (judgment), sits on the stand
which supports the balance where the good deeds of
the dead man are weighed against an ostrich feather.
These sculptures are full of the deepest interest, as
teaching us something of the Egyptian’s belief in a
future life. There is not a doubt that they distinctly
recognised the great facts of a life after death, the
resurrection of the body, and a judgment to come.
Indeed, a future world seems to have been much in
their thoughts. The ﬁrst thing which the king did
when he began his reign was to begin his tomb.
‘The inhabitants of this country,” says Diodorus,
“little value the short time of this present life, but put
a high esteem upon the name and reputation of a
virtuous life after death ; and they call the houses of
the living z'mzs, because they stay in them but a little
while ; but the sepulchres of the dead they call ever-
lasting Izaéz'mtz'om, because they abide in the grave to
inﬁnite generations. Therefore they are not very
curious in the building of their houses, but in beauti-
fying their sepulchres they leave nothing undone.”
