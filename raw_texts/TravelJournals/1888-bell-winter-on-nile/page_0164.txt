148 A HUNTER ON THE NILE.

 

I suggest as a reason why future rewards and
punishments were not-attached to the Mosaic code,
that, had they been so, the Israelites would have been
led to think that salvation came by the law. If heaven
had been promised as the recompense of obedience to
the commandments, then the natural conclusion would
have been that the sinner is saved, not by grace, but
by works. But however this may be, and believing
that “Christ brought life and immortality to light
through His gospel,” shedding illumination on man’s
true and endless life, and making it stand out more
distinctly as an object of faith and hope than ever
it had done in the early dispensation; yet I cannot
believe that the Hebrew Scriptures either ignore or
reject the h0pes and fears connected with the world
to come. With the full assumption that God was the
Legislator, and often the Executor of His own law in
the Mosaic dispensation, and that He often punished
violations of the law visibly and at once; yet there
is nothing in this to militate against the truth that,
“both in the Old and New Testaments, everlasting
life is offered to mankind by Christ, and that the old
Fathers did not look for transitory promises only.”

I think I need hardly say that the teaching of the
prophets, though this is denied by some, is pervaded
by this paramountly inﬂuential and morally vital idea
