BERENICE ’s HAIR. ' 1 1

 

The noun m‘dmn was ﬁlled,

Glittered the spear, and ﬂashed the shield,
. At sound of trump each heart was thrilled,
And legions burned to take the ﬁeld.

Before he crossed the palace gate,
He raised a yearning look above,
Where Berenice lonely sat,
Dear as his life, his wife, his love.

She saw him go; she bends her head,
From her sad eyes the big tears fall,
And with a faint, low voice she said,
“ My love, my husband, and my all.

“ Ye gods that dwell in yonder sky,
And o’er the earth and man hold reign,
Look down on him with pitying eye,
Bring Euergetes back again.

“ Upon your altars will I lay

All that I have or hold most dear,
Will pour libations day by day,

Will slay for you the spotless steer.

“ Only bring back my lord in peace,
Victorious from this dreadful ﬁght,
And prayers and incense shall not cease
To rise and burn by day and night.”

The months passed by—he came not yet ;
Her heart was bowed with anxious fears,
Her sweet blue eyes were often wet
With sad and unavailing tears.

Were the gods deaf to all her prayers?
Regardless of her grief and woe ?
