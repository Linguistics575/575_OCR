36 A WINTER ON THE ML 15‘.

 

Amenophis the Third; for in Egypt a noble family
might be perpetuated through the female line. Pharaoh
was the title of all these kings, and is the Hebrew
form of the Egyptian Perau, or Phra. It signiﬁes
the “great house,” or “ high gate.” The idea survives
in the title of the Sultan—“ the Sublime Portc.”

Looking at the mummy of Seti the First, we see
all that remains of a king mighty in his day, and who
carried his conquests into Asia. But war was not the
only thought in his mind. He sought the improve-
ment of the country, and he made the ﬁrst canal
between the Nile and the Red Sea. His tomb, known
as Belzoni’s, is one of the most magniﬁcent of the
“ tombs of the kings” at Thebes. You gaze upon his
embalmed face, and you see that it is marked by lines
of beauty and intellect. The face is oval, the nose
aquiline in shape, the forehead not high but broad,
the upper lip long, and the chin rounded and ﬁrm.
Standing there, we look at no common man, and one
who lies before you after the long sleep of more than
a thousand years.

By the side of Seti is the mummy of his greater
son, Rameses II., the Sesostris of the Greek historians,
and the Oxymandias of the Persians. He was the
monarch under whom Upper Egypt rose to its
greatest pre-eminence in war, and in arts, and wealth
