BERENICE ’5 HA IR. :3

 

They placed them in the vaulted blue,
And when drew on the shades of even,
At once a constellation new
Flashed in the purple depths of heaven.

And ever now, when falls the night,
And cloudless are the depths of air,

Amongst the stars and planets bright
Shines brightest Berenice’s hair.
