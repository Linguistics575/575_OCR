A’ARNAK B i MOONLIGHT. 2 57

 

KARNAK BY MOONLIGHT.

Come, stand with me in this great column’d hall,
And let the mellow moonlight clasp us round.
Make bare thy head ; is not this holy ground ?

Mark how each sculptur’d pylon, gate, and wall,

The granite obelisk, so fair and tall,

Which great Queen Hatasou raised on that mound,
Shine like to silver, while from bound to bound
All is lit up as though for festival.

Never did moon more luminously bright,

Make each carved lotus pillar gleam like snow,
0r set a crown of glory on the night,

For e’en the very shadows seem to glow—
Think you such glories ﬂashed upon the sight

Of great Rameses centuries ago?
