THEBES. 97

 

“Thebes,” as Mr. Reginald Stuart Poole tells us
in his Cities and Monument: of Egypt, “ had, like the
other cities of Egypt, a civil and a religious name.
The civil name was Apiu, ‘ the city of thrones,’ which,
with the article ‘ t,’ or ‘ ta,’ became Ta-Apiu, and was
identiﬁed by the Greeks with the name of their once
famous city, by us corruptly called Thebes. The
sacred name was Nu-Amen, ‘the city of Amen,’
the god of Thebes; or simply Nu, ‘the city,’ and
Nu-éi, ‘the great city.’ In these names we recognise
the No-Amon, and No of Scripture.” Ammon-Ra,
typiﬁed by the sun, is the principal deity worshipped
at Thebes, and with him is associated Maut, the
divine mother, and Chonsu, the offspring of both—-
they form the Theban trinity.

Thebes must have been a large and magniﬁcent
city, with its palaces and temples, its hundred gates,
its public buildings, and its private dwellings. Of
the city there is no trace. All that remains of its
grandeur are the two temples of Luxor and Karnak
on the eastern shore, and the temples of El Goornah,
the Rameseum, and Medinet-Habou, on the western
shore. Luxor is a small market town of some m-
portance, the residence of the English, the American,
and the Italian consuls. There are now two hotels,
the Luxor and the Karnak, and many visitors of all
