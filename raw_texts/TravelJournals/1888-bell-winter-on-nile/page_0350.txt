3 34 A WINTER ON THE NILE.

 

It might be thought that on or near a river so
broad and shallow as the Nile, and with its sloping
mud banks, the climate would be damp; but facts
show the contrary. Humidity recorded on the Nile
gives an average of 5 3'3 per cent. (saturation being
represented by 100) between January Ist and March
11th, as compared with an average of 91 per cent.
, in London at the same time of year, and 76 per
cent. in July and August, the driest months in
England.

Therefore, as regards quantity of sun, small rainfall,
and dryness of atmosphere, winter on the Nile will
bear very favourable comparison with any winter
climate with which I am acquainted.

Another advantage in winter is the bracing charac-
ter of the air. The prevailing wind is from the north,
blowing from the sea 500 or 1,000 miles away, and
coming across the desert; and even in the east and
west winds there are bracing properties hardly to be
expected in so warm a climate. Another advantage:
though there is a fall of temperature at night, there is
no dew; because, perhaps, the rapid radiation and
cooling down of the earthâ€™s surface is unable to reduce
the adjacent atmosphere to cooling point. Even
when the air contains 88 per cent. of moisture, there
is no dew.
