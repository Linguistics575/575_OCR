which, at each turn of the wheel, works up a series
of earthen pitchers, which empty themselves into a
trough, and through this send the life-giving waters
through the thirsty land. Or perhaps it may be the
shadoof that is at work. This consists of a long pole,
very heavy at one end, and resting on a pivot. At
the other end is placed a bucket, which is let down
into the water and ﬁlled, and as the heavy end
descends, the bucket pours its contents into a small
trough. From this it is worked by the foot, and ﬂows
into the channels, by which it is conveyed to the wait-
ing ﬁelds. There is even a simpler method of raising
the water intended for irrigation. Two men stand in
the pool or stream, holding a bucket which is water-
tight between them, and which, as they swing it to and
fro, throws the water on to the bank, on which stands
a third man, ready to turn it into the proper channel.
This, no doubt, is the labour from which Moses tells
the Israelites they shall be free when .they have
entered the land ﬂowing with milk and honey. “ For
the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as
the land of Egypt, from whence lye came out, where
thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot ;
but is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water
of the rain of heaven ” (Deut. xi. 10, II).
