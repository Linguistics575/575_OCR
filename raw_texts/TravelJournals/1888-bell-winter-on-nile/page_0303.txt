CUTTING THE DAM 01“ THE CANAL. 287

 

like a ﬂood, and his waters are moved like the rivers :
and he saith, I will go up, and will cover the earth ;
Iwill destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof”
(Jer. xlvi. 7, 8). The prOphet Amos speaks of
the desolation of a country under the same ﬁgure:
“ And the Lord God of hosts is He that toucheth
the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein
shall mourn : and it shall rise up wholly like a ﬂood ;
and shall be drowned, as by the ﬂood of Egypt ”
(Amos ix. 5).

As soon the Government issues a proclamation
of“ Full Nile,” then ensues the ceremony of cutting
the dam of the canal El Khalig. “The dam,” as
we read in Lane’s Modern Egyptians, “is con-
structed before, or soon after the commencement
of, the N ile’s increase. The Khalig, or canal, at
the distance of about 400 feet within its entrance, is
crossed by an old stone bridge of one arch. About
sixty feet in front of this bridge is the dam, which is
of earth, very broad at the bottom, and diminish-
ing in breadth towards the top, which is ﬂat,
and about three yards broad. The top of the dam
rises to a height of about twenty-two or twenty-
three feet above the level of the Nile when at the
lowest, but not so high above the bed of the canal,
for this is several feet above the low-water mark
