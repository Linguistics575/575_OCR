T IDS WELL—A B 00 SUI/[BEL 221

 

TIDSWE LL.

Where Aboo Simbel’s giant temple stands,
And carved in rock four noble forms appear,
That thus have sat enthroned through many a year,
There lies just at their feet, ’mid golden sands,
A lonely tomb, the work of tender hands,
Which keeps the dust of one, a stranger here,
Who rests apart from all who hold him dear,
And weep his loss in the far English lands.

Surely I deem that all who hither come,
Cast a sad look on that pathetic grave,
Which bears a name,—God knows how dear to some,—
“ Tidswell,”-—true gentleman, and soldier brave,
Who now sleeps well beneath the sunlit dome,
Close to the music of the N ile’s dark wave.

ABOO SIMBEL.

0 great Rameses on thy awful seat

At Aboo Simbel, ’midst the golden sands,

Who carried war’s ﬁerce torch to distant lands,
And trampled kingdoms ’neath thy conquering feet,
Upon whose brow Egypt’s two crowns did meet ;

Here in “the mountain of pure water” stands

A house divine built by thy loving hands,

For her to thee above all women sweet.

Although so great, thou couldst be tender too,
For in this carven ﬁgure at thy side,

Stands N ofreari, fair and gentle-eyed,
Whom in her youthful beauty thou didst woo,

And made her all thine own, thy life, thy bride,
And held her to thine heart as lovers do.
