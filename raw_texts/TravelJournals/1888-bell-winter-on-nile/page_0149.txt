THE VOCAL AND THE SILENT MEMNON; I33

 

THE VOCAL MEMNON (Theda).

Memnon, thou’rt mute, thy voice is heard no more ;,
The rising sun now visits thee in vain.
No music greets his coming ; ne’er again
Thy song shall ﬂoat the Theban valley o’er,
. Or thrilling reach the far Arabian shore,
Never shall ﬁll with music the wide plain.
Methinks thy sightless eyes are full of pain,
Because thou art not as in days of yore.

Change hast thou seen, colossal Form in stone,
Kings and their armies pass’d into the grave ;
Great dynasties destroyed, whose fame was blown

Across whole continents, and o’er the wave,
And nothing left the Founder’s name to save,
But records traced on walls with weeds o’ergrown.

THE SILENT MEMNON.

A sweeter music, Memnon, far than thine
Is heard since thou wast silent, for since then
The Christ has lived, loved, died amongst us men,
So that the earth is now a sacred shrine,
Hallowed by that Great Presence all Divine,
And from it hymns of praise rise up again,
As once before in those far ages when
God’s face in Paradise was seen to shine.

So if the old gods pass we do not mourn,

Rather rejoice the false bears sway no more ;
That faiths have perished that were all out-worn,
And in themselves seeds of corruption bore ;

That deities of all their glories shorn,
Stand silent ever on Time’s waveless shore.
