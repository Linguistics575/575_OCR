INVALIDS AND FOOD. 85

 

to-day as the pz'éce de resistance; and the fowl that
this morning was brought to the boat or the hotel
with its wings tied together behind its back, you eat
with your salad before the pudding. The invalid’s
appetite is generally both delicate and fastidious, and
requires coaxing, and there is nothing to coax it in
the hotels or on the Nile steamers, comfortable as
they are, and consequently the invalid suffers. I have

heard more than once loud complaints on this head.
