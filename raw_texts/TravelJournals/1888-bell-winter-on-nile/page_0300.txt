through the lower rooms and the outer court, they
were thronged as upon our arrival ; and it seemed very
evident that the festivities were only at their height,
and would be prolonged far into the morning. On
leaving the house, we found the streets crowded with
carriages and peOple, and the coloured lamps were
still burning before the door.
