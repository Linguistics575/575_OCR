EGYPTIAN VIEWS OF THE jUDGMENT. I4!

ness. Secret sins, sins of omission, sins of thought,
on which man cannot pronounce judgment, now come
under review; and Thoth produces the books in
which he has recorded all the inner life of the man
who is to be acquitted or condemned. . Here are seen
the forty-two judges, each representing one of the
forty-two sins which, according to the belief of the
Egyptians, man was subject to, and they examine the
soul in respect to that particular sin. Then comes the
trial of the balance. The heart is placed in one scale,
the symbols of truth and justice in the other. The
hawk-headed Thoth, the scribe of the gods, is present,
ready to record the issue. Horus watches the scale
in which the heart is placed, and at the same time
eagerly scrutinizes the index of the balance. The
dog-headed Anubis trims the opposite scale, and
makes known the result of his scrutiny; and Thoth,
who stands with his tablet‘ and pen in front of Osiris,
the supreme judge, records the sentence in his
presence. Osiris, holding the sceptre and scourge,
which symbolize justice and law, and seated in a
shrine, wears a crown adorned with two ostrich
feathers, and with the disc of the sun, and the horns
of a goat. An altar, surmounted by the lotus ﬂower,
and laden with offerings probably presented by the
relatives of the deceased, stands in front of the shrine.
