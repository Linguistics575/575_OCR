T was delightful to exchange the fogs and rains
of England, the frosts and snows of Europe,
for the blue skies and clear atmosphere, the warmth
and sunshine of Egypt. And pleasant it was to
leave the restless and unquiet sea, and to ﬁnd one’s
self within the double harbour of Alexandria. The
steamer came to anchor there on the 29th of Decem-
ber, 1887; and one could hardly believe, as we
stepped on shore, in most brilliant weather, that it
was so near the close of the year. There was not
only sunshine, but many ﬂowers were in bloom,—
the poinsettia, with its scarlet petals, which grows
to the size of a tall shrub; the crimson hibiscus,
and the purple bougainvillea, whose rich deep purple
puts to shame the paler-hued blossom of our conser-
vatories.
