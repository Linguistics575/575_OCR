AIASSACRE OF THE MAAIELUKES. 61

 

——for butchery it was—took place on the Ist of March,
1811, and the number who were slain in the citadel
amounted to 500. Many more of inferior rank were
destroyed in the city, and the power of the Mamelukes
crushed for ever. Mohammed Ali’s slaughtered
victims were replaced by an army of Turks and
Circassians, on whose loyalty and devotion he could
rely. But though he gained his object, he rightly
suffered in the estimation of all civilized nations by
this infamous deed of treacherous barbarity. In some
accounts of the incident, the horse that took the leap
is said to have been killed, while Emin Bey escaped ;
but I prefer to believe the story as narrated above,
and'to think that the noble steed did not lose his life,
and was his master’s friend and companion for many
a long day.
