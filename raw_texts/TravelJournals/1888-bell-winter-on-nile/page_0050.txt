34 , A WINTER ON THE NILE.

 

tombs and temples as the symbol of immortality; and
no doubt it was adopted as the symbol of a future
life from the habits of this insect. The beetle, when
the time approaches for laying its eggs, deposits
them on the moist soil on the banks of the Nile,
which it forms into a round ball; and this being
done, it pushes the little globe up the steep, and
rolls it away to the sands, which often lie some
distance off. Having reached the sands, it hollows
out a grave, in which it buries itself and the ball of
clay containing its eggs. There in due season the
eggs produce each a chrysalis, and from this chrysalis
emerges a winged beetle, which ﬂies to and fro
in the sunshine. Now, in this life emerging from
the grave and gate of death, the old Egyptians saw
a symbol of resurrection, and hence they placed
the scarab—the beetle regarded by them as sacred-—
with wings extended in the mummy case, and for
the same reason they engraved its form on their rings
or cut it on their seals. Numbers of these scarabs,
many thousand years old, cut in stone, or wood, and
found in the mummy cases, are offered for sale by the
Arabs; and there are few travellers who do not
purchase some to carry with them home.
