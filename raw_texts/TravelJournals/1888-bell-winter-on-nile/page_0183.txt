THE TEMPLE 0F EDFOU. 167

 

scrutiny of the antiquarian. It is the only temple in
Egypt which stands in its original perfection, com-
plete as the architects left it. The temple was founded
by Ptolemy Philopater, and dedicated to “Horus
of the Winged Disc.” Ptolemy built the various
courts, the sanctuary, and the chapel ; his successors
added the decorations of the inner chambers, and
an inscription records that the temple, begun under
Philopater, ﬁnished under Euergetes II., was com-
pleted, after interruptions caused by wars, in ninety-
ﬁve years. Mariette thinks “that this statement can
apply to the actual construction only, and not to the
decorations, since from the beginning of the reign of
Philopater to the death of Dionysos, the last of the
kings whose cartouches appear in the temple, no less
than I 70 years elapsed. There is a close resemblance
in its construction and details between this temple
and the temple of Denderah ; both are beautiful, and
richly decorated, though Edfou is the more perfect
of the two. It is a pleasant circumstance that we
know who was the architect of so noble a building,
for he has put his name to his work ;” and that name
was Ei-em-hotep-Oer-si-Phtah (Imouthes, the great
son of Phtah).1 You look with interest on the
