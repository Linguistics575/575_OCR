You enter the temple of Rameses III. through two
immense pylons leading to two spacious courts, both
open to the sky. The ﬁrst court has a covered colon-
nade at each side, and on the right is a row of seven
pillars, bearing the ﬁgure of Osiris, or rather Rameses

graceful papyrus plant. The same court is surrounded
by a peristyle, supported on the east and west by
ﬁve massive columns, while to the south is a row of
eight Osiride pillars; and on the north side is a
similar number. This court was once used as a Chris-

of its sculptures, and the scenes pictured on its walls,
is - given in Murray’s Handbook of Egypt. Miss
