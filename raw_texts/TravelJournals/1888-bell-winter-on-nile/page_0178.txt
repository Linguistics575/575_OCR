162 A WINTER ON THE NILE.

 

Arabian hills were glowing in the distance, the lights
of a faint rose, the shadows of a deep purple; while
in the foreground lay the yellow sands, and the deep
green plain, and feathery palms, and the blue waters
of the Nile ï¬‚owing tranquilly along. It was a scene
of great beauty ; andover it, from their lofty thrones,
kept watch the solitary pair.

THE TWIN COLOSSI.

These two through ages have been sitting here,
Two solemn forms of one great king in stone,
The plinth beneath them serving for a throne.
Here they have reigned as passed each passing year,
Unmoved by hope, untroubled by a fear.
With eyes that fain would pierce to lands unknown,
Beyond the burning sand-dunes waste and drear,
Watchers they are across the desert lone.

Seated with hands upon their knees imprest,

Did they not symbolise to all who came,
Eternal silence and eternal rest ?

For though the world might change, they sat the same
In grandeur immemorial ever drest,

And robed in majesty beyond all name.
