TOMBS. 87

 

ivory, richly embroidered saddles, and ornaments in
silver and gold. ’

A A short ride beyond Assiout, the Lycopolis of the
Greeks, where the wolf was worshipped, are tombs
cut in the rock, where the mummies of the sacred
animal were deposited. Mummied wolves have been
found in the caves in the mountain, and also mummied
jackals. One of these is to be seen in the Egyptian
Room at the British Museum. The tombs are of
very ancient date. There is one cave called “Stabl
d’Antar ”—the stable of Antar—which is spacious and
lofty, the ceiling being covered with patterns in blue
and grey, and the hieroglyphic sculptures coloured in
red and blue. At the entrance of some of the caves
were fragments of human bones and bits of mummy
cloth, and the Arabs who followed us up the hill
offered these for sale.

That which pleased me most was the ﬁne view from
the hills to Assiout, with its mosques and minarets,
and over the Nile Valley to the river, which wound
like a thread of silver through the plain, green with
the young corn, interspersed with the graceful palm.
To the east is the purple outline ‘of the Arabian
hills ; and to the west, as we turn round on the brow
of the rock of Djebil, we see the golden light and soft
violet shadows that fall on the distant desert sands.
