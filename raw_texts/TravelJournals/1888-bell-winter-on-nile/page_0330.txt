believe that man has been evolved out of the monera,
—to hold that “there is no doubt that he is descended
from an extinct mammalian form, which, if we could
see it, we should certainly class with the apes ; and it
is equally certain, we are assured, that this primitive
ape in turn descended from an unknown semi-ape,
and the latter from an extinct pouched animal.” And
this animal in its turn descended from another unlike
creature; and so on by successive steps backward,
until the ﬁrst shapeless, structureless mass of proto-
plasm is reached, which was, we are told, the true
ancestor of man.

“ Monera,” as probably the reader knows, is the
plural of the word “monern ;” and a monern is each
individual living particle of this ﬁrst structureless mass
of protoplasm. But this does not account for the
origin of life; and therefore Hae'ckel assumes that at
some time in the unknown past, life was introduced
on our globe by spontaneous generation. This, how-
ever, is but the offspring of a scientiﬁc imagination,
and is unsupported by proof. The assumption is
introduced in order to get rid of the miraculous ; yet
what could be more miraculous than such spontaneous
generation. For life cannot be the product of inert
matter, or of molecular motion, which the particles
