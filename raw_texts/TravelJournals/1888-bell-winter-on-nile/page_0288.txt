Then, as regards its religion, does it not mainly consist
of that “bodily exercise ” which “proﬁteth little”?
The Moslem’s prayer may be as mechanical an ex-
ercise as the turning of the prayer-wheel in Tibet, for
the words of the prescribed ritual need not be even
understood, and nothing more is required than that
the words be repeated in Arabic, and in the position
which is prescribed. All that is needed for a Moham-
medan’s salvation is to repeat these prayers ﬁve times
a day, to give aims, and observe the yearly fast of the
Ramazan, and make himself, or by deputy, the pilgrim-
age to Mecca,—let him do this, and Paradise and the
Houris are his for evermore. Islam has no great ideals
or high aspirations,—has nothing to attract the noblest
minds, or to constrain them to dare all things, and to ‘
count all things but loss, if they can only reach the
lofty standard which is proposed to their hope. Chris-
tianity holds out an ideal of life in its humility, its
purity, its self-denial and toleration, its forgiveness of
injuries, and its brotherly love, altogether unknown
to the religion of Islam; and, therefore, one rejoices
at every attempt such as those made by the American
Missions, and Miss Whately’s admirable schools at
Cairo, to propagate Christianity, and to win men to
the knowledge and love of its Founder.
