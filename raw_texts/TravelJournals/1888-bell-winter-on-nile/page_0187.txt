temple of the date of the Pharaohs of an early part
of the Third Period, and bears the name of Philo-
meter, of Euergetes II., and of Dionysos. It consists

placed side by side, they are dedicated to gods as
eternally antagonistic as are the principles of good
and evil: the one has Horus, the god of light, for its
tutelary deity; the other is dedicated to Sebek, the
crocodile god, who symbolizes darkness. It is thought
that this temple will soon disappear, and that the
sand-drifts from the desert will ere long bury the
