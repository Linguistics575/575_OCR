246 A WINTER ON THE NILE.

 

O vanity ! thy statues are o’erthrown, '
Thy palacesblocked up with drifting sand,

Thy tombs the owls and bats have made their own,
And where thy temples once did proudly stand,

There now remains the shattered, prostrate stone,
And ruin reigns triumphant o’er thy land.
