THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION. 323

 

gustz'bus m'l disputandum,—there is no accounting for
tastes; but besides this, the Professor here takes no
account of man’s spiritual powers—takes no notice
at all of that highernature by which he is related to
God. Which is the more important part of man,-—--his
bodily organism, by which he is related to the beasts
below him, or his spiritual nature, by which he is
related to God above him? The truth that man was
made in the image of God is the only rational basis
of revelation ; for if there were not something within-
us akin to God, how could we form any conception of
God,—of His holiness or justice, His Fatherhood or
love? We could have no idea of God at all, unless
we had been made in His image. What can a beast
know of God P What can a beast know even of man?

Here, too, we see how natural is the Incarnation ;
for what more natural than that the Eternal Son
should take the form of man, seeing that man was
made in the likeness of God? Here, moreover, we
see how easy of acceptance becomes the doctrine of
man’s renewal by the Spirit. “ God breathed into
man’s nostrils the breath of life, and he became a
living soul ;” and now for his restoration from the
death of sin to the life of righteousness he receives
the inspiration of the Almighty,—-the inbreathing of
the Spirit of God. i
