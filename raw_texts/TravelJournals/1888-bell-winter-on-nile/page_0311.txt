EGYPT A FIELD FOR MISSION WORK. 295

 

English, and all of whom spoke English, and a most
attentive audience I had. Such a free-will attendance
of young men to hear an address founded on Holy
Scripture, proves, I think, that there is a spirit of
inquiry abroad, and that “the ﬁelds are white already
unto harvest.” The fact of English beingtaught in
many of the schools, not only in the Delta, but in
Upper Egypt, holds out the possibility that there may
be soon in Egypt an English-speaking population;
and what an opening for mission work among the
pe0ple this would be, and what a means, in the provi-
dence of God, of furthering the gospel! Surely all
that remains for those who believe that Christianity
is immeasurably superior to Mohammedanism, who
accept the truth that there is none other name where-
by we can be saved but Christ’s, is to obey the
marching orders of the Great Captain of our salva-
tion, and “preach the gospel ” to those who hold the
false faith of Islam. The French are wise in their
generation; and I understand that their Government
subsidizes those schools in which the French language

is taught, and by these means endeavours to gain an '
inﬂuence in Egypt, and a hold over the population.
Why should not England give some pecuniary assist-
ance to the schools where English is made a part of
the curriculum, and so maintain and extend the hold
