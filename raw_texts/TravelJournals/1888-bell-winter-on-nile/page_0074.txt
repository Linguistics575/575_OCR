58 A HUNTER ON THE NILE.

 

Virgin—for, according to a Coptic legend, Mary rested
here with Joseph and her ﬁrst-born son; and it is
not improbable that the tradition may be true. It is
not at all unlikely that the holy family should seek
refuge in a spot so connected with the history of their
nation. Close to the Virgin’s Tree is the miraculous
fountain, which, according to another COptic tradition,
was once salt, but which became sweet when Mary
bathed the infant Jesus in its waters. Whether a
wish to believe interesting traditions will carry all so
far as to credit this legend is doubtful. But in Egypt,
as in the Holy Land, we must often doubt where an
unquestioning faith would be delightful. Be this as
it may, we know from history that in the celebrated
university of Heliopolis, Solon' and Pythagoras and
Plato studied, and Strabo was shown the house where
the latter resided ; and they must often have admired
the sculpture, and interpreted the inscriptions of this
monument of Osirtasen. The bees had not then
covered the hieroglyphics with their nests, and the
granite shaft stood in all the freshness of its beauty,
though even then many years had passed away since
its erection at On. And now all is waste and desola-
tion where once stood a famous and populous city, a
few green ﬁelds recovered from the sands cover the

monuments of the dead.
