T was with great regret that we left Luxor, about
the middle of February. The weather was
growing very hot; but sunshine and warmth are
like life to me, and I would willingly have remained
some weeks longer. However, all things pleasant
must come to an end; and so, having said farewell
to many 'friends, we got on board the Mohammad
Ali, a boat which from former experience we knew
well, and liked, and steamed down the Nile as far as
Kenneh.

We went on shore, and mounted, after the usual
struggle with the Arabs, the donkeys which were
waiting our arrival, some of them very ﬁne animals,
and rode to the. town, which is a large one, in order
to see the manufacture of porous water-jars and

earthen bottles, which are much used throughout
