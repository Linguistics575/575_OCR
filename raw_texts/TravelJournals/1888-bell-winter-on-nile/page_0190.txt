x 74 A WINTER ON THE NILE.

 

Here there is a large assortment of elephants’ tusks
and leopard skins, of strong sticks and ebony clubs,
of strings of beads and silver bracelets, of ostrich
feathers, and black. girdles made of leather and
adorned with white shells, and well saturated with
castor oil. These girdles form the only dress of a
Nubian girl. The scanty garment is known as a
“ Madam Nubia.” But the articles just mentioned do
not form the only merchandise in the bazaar, for if
you are so disposed you may buy the red and black
baskets of the country, and slippers of all colours,
and shawls and handkerchiefs which have a strangely
familiar appearance, and which, with cotton goods,
are much prized in Assouan, for they come all the
way from Manchester. The castor—oil plant grows
here, and the oil is much used by the Nubian belles,
who soak their hair in it after it has been plaited'
into innumerable and elaborate curls. They are
evidently proud of their black and corkscrew tresses.
Opposite to Assouan, and on the western side of
the river, is the island of Elephantine. Here the
small population is entirely Nubian. The island is
eminently disappointing; for as you know that it is
called by the natives “ Geyeeretez Zaher,” “ the island
of ﬂowers,” and as you have heard marvellous tales of
its beauty, you expect a little Eden of loveliness and
