128 A WINTER ON THE NILE.

 

been the library of the palace, is an astronomical
subject; and an inscription makes mention of the
“ Books of Thoth,” the god of letters, and Saf, the
lady of the sacred books. “This primitive Mercury
is here attended,” as Champollion records, “by a
ﬁgure with an eye on his head, and surmounted
by a legend, ‘Sense of Light ;’ the goddess Saf
being attended in like manner by a ﬁgure with an
ear on his head, and labelled, ‘Sense of Hearing.’ ”
Champollion interprets these ﬁgures as indicators
and guardians of the library—the Books of Thoth.l

There are many other sculptures on the walls of
this temple, and here again, as in other temples, we
see the king making offerings and burning incense
to the gods ; but those mentioned above are perhaps
of the greatest interest, and are worthy of the closest
inspection. As we trace the hand of the sculptor
who ﬁnished his work thousands of years ago, we
can only marvel at the greatness of his conception,
and the delicacy of his ornament in so early an age
of the world. '

There is a tomb close to the Rameseum, and im-
mediately behind it, which I visited several times.
