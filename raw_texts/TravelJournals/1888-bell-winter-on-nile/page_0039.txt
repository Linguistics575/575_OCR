THE BAZAARS. 2 3

 

covered with silken braid, or embroidered in silver
and gold. Then there is the shoe bazaar, where you
will ﬁnd walking shoes, or slippers for the room ; red
slippers, turned up at the toes, much worn by the
natives; and velvet slippers in purple or blue, en-
crusted with beads and with pearls, or embroidered
with silver and gold. If you wish to be carried back
to the days of Haroon-en-Raschid; if you want to
be transported to the scenes of the enchanting stories
of the “ Arabian Nights,” rub your “ Aladdin’s lamp,”
and go. inside what'still remains of old and pictur-
esque Cairo, and your dreams will be realized, and
your desires fulﬁlled.

No doubt Cairo is not what it was, even a few
years ago. It is losing much of its picturesqueness
by being Europeanized, and some of its most beau-
tiful architectural monuments have been destroyed.
But enough still happily remains to give pleasure and
satisfaction. You will indeed meet with squalor and
dirt, but you will also ﬁnd grace and beauty. Even
in unfrequented thoroughfares, in the stillness of
streets where there are neither bazaars nor shops,
there are marvellous effects of light and shade, a
quaint corbel, a decorated door, an old mosque falling
to decay, but whose graceful minaret, like a ﬂame of
ﬁre, cleaves the sky, and soars away into the sunshine.
