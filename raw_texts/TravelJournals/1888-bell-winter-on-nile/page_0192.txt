_ 176 A HUNTER ON THE NILE.

 

weird and desolate surroundings. One must go up
to Mahattah, just above the rapids, and see the
torrent from thence, and shoot it in a small boat,
before it is possible to understand the wildness of
the scene, or the excitement that attends the descent
in a canoe. We shot the cataract on our return from
Wady Halfa, and I leave further remarks on the
tumult of the waters until I have had the pleasure of
being carried safely down the whirling and rushing
stream.

“WHERE ARE THE GREAT AND SCEPTRED
KINGS?”

Where are the great and sceptred kings of yore,
Who carried wars and conquests far and wide,
And built their temples near that dusky tide

Which plants a green oasis on the shore 3

Oh, where the suppliants who oﬂ"rings bore
To Pasht and Isis, gods to whom they cried,
Or to the sacred bulls they deiﬁed?

Gone are their pomp and pride for evermore.

Where are the maidens once as Hathor fair,

With whom these conquerors had loved to toy,
Girls sweet as lotus-blossom in their hair,

Who ﬁlled the world with laughter and with joy?

Withered the beauty men thought could not cloy,-—-
The charms that stung their rivals to despair.
