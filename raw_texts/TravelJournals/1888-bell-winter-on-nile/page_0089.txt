A SUGAR FACTORY. 73

groves of palms. We “ tied up ” at Maghaga for the
night. There is “a sugar factory here which we visited
in the evening, walking about two miles under the
lustre of the stars, and assisted by the light from
some lanterns carried by men from the boat. The
path led through ﬁelds of corn and lentils, and
close to the Nile. The soil is very rich, and crops of
sugar-cane are grown on the level between the rocks
and the river for some distance along the banks.
The tall, heavy-looking chimneys seem out of place
amidst such surroundings, and contrast ill with the
light and graceful minarets of the mosques. The
factory is lighted by gas, and the engines were made
at Paris. It was a strange and a weird scene. Hun-
dreds of men and children are employed here. Some
work from ﬁve in the morning until six in the evening
Others work through the night. Numbers were
lying about on the ground asleep, worn out by the
day’s labour, and overcome by the heat. As wood
is scarce in the country, and charcoal cannot be
had, burnt bones are used for reﬁning the juice.
The noise of the engines, the heat of the gas, the
smell of the brown liquid running in troughs, the
half-naked workmen, formed a combination of dis-
agreeables which made one glad to beat a retreat as

soon as possible, and it was pleasant to stand again
