VOLCANIC PEAAâ€™S. [93

 

From the vast Libyan desert rise isolated volcanic
peaks of a pyramidal form. The cones vary in height
and size; some are circular and low, others rise up in
great purple masses against the blue. They lend a
new and interesting character to the landscape, and
give the traveller the idea that he is journeying through
a land of pyramids.
