90 THE BOULAG MUSEUM.

“ that this is the most wonderful thing in the
Museum; it will ever remain in my memory.
It is made of sycamore wood, which is now,
you see, as hard as metal. There is intelli-
gence in the expression of the face; but the
eyes are the most wonderful thing -— they
seem to follow you wherever you go. They
are inserted; the whites are made of opaque
quartz, the lashes of ﬁne rims of bronze, and
the pupil is a small crystal, so cut that it
reﬂects a light like that of the human eye.
How the face seems to light up, and the eye
to sparkle like life, as the sunshine creeps in
and falls upon it! Six thousand years this
form has stood imperishable, the oldest statue
now existing in the world.”

After standing a long while before this in-
teresting ﬁgure, they walked about for some
time among the statues, sarcophagi, and many
curiosities, and at last went lingeringly forth
from the interesting relics. '

In the afternoon they selected donkeys——
Yusuf being on hand with Mark Twain—and
having hired a guide, they started on an excur-

I.
