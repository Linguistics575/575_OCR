objects to those below. Many groups were
gathered in the building, and voices in all
languages echoed through the rooms.

Yusuf was among the crowd of donkey-boys,
having brought a young fop out to see the
wonder of the world. The gentleman was
evidently disappointed in the pyramid. He
looked up at it through his eye-glasses very
critically, and then turning to an English
oﬂicer who stood near, said,—

“ Well, this is the great pyramid over which
you all rave: I don’t see anything remarkable
about it. It took one hundred thousand men
twenty years to build it! Pshaw! we could
put one just like it up in Central Park in a
fortnight.”

The old oﬂicer, turning to a friend near, said
in a low tone,—

“ He reminds me of a young man I saw at
Niagara Falls when I was in America. Look-
ing at that awful mass of water he said, with
a yawn, ‘ Oh, ah, call this Niagara Falls, eh?
I don’t see anything so wonderful about it.’
