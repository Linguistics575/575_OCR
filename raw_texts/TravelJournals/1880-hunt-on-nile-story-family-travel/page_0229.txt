334 GOOD-B YE TO E0 YPT.

Colonel Dayton started to his feet. “ Come
on, Yusuf,” he said; “ we’ll see what we can do
about getting him back ; ” and the two left the
boat. About a half- hour afterwards they
returned, leading the donkey. Yusuf was
crying for joy, and hugging and kissing the
animal alternately.

Mollie and Grace both rushed forward to
greet the new-comer. “ O Colonel Dayton,
how did you get him '9 ” they cried de—_
lightedly. '

“ Why, the thief gave him up on the
instan ,” he said. “ These Arabs are the
greatest cowards. He told a great story
about buying him of a fellow in Cairo, but
very generously passed him over to Yusuf,
swearing all the time to his own innocence. I
can’t prove he is guilty, so I thought, as we
leave so soon, and have the donkey in our pos-
session, it would be better to let the thief go.
However, I frightened him nearly out of his
senses.” And the colonel laughed heartily.
