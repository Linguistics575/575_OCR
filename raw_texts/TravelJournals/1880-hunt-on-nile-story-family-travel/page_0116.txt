“ for there are not seventy thousand there.”

“ I suspect,” said the colonel, smiling, “ that
before long it will consist entirely of angels, for
the number of pilgrims decreases every year.”

“ Ah,” said Grace, “ how I should like to
have seen it in the grand old days of the
Mamelukes, who rode forth in gorgeous robes
of crimson, gold, and blue, with splendid arms
and jewels, while bands of dervishes went be-

fore amid music and song.”
