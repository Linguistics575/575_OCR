138 ON THE NILE.

Nile is low and the steep banks high. There
is a small sail at the stern which is not often
used on the upward journey, but on the down-
ward voyage it takes the place of the great
sail, which is then removed.

About midships two steps lead down to the
saloon, which occupies the whole breadth of
the boat. There are windows on both sides
with divans beneath reaching the length of
the saloon ; a table in the centre, some chairs,
and a bookcase, complete the furniture.
Heavy curtains at the farther end of the
room cover a narrow passage, out of which on
each side open the sleeping-rooms.

But the quarter-deck is the general sitting-
room. There are some easy-chairs here, a
divan running round its sides, and a table on
which .is generally found a pile of papers and
books. Over this is the awning, which is
always taken down at sunset and put up in
the morning.

The little boat with oars and boat-hook,
in tow behind, is called a sandal, and is used
for going ashore.
