and turban walks behind, holding a staff?

“ The Flight into Egypt,” said Mollie
quickly, and added, “ I, too, have often noticed
it when, sitting on our deck in the sunset, I
have watched the scenes on the river’s ba .”

“ It is wonderful,” said Grace, reverently,
“ the way in which the Bible is recalled to one
at every moment in this land.”
