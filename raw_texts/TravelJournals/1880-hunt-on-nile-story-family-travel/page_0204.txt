down on the ravages of time. There they
stand, showing to us and future generations
what Thebes was in the day of her pride and
glory. The temple which they guarded now
lies a mass of ruins, and the royal avenue of
sphinxes has vanished in the sand; but, en-
throned in solitary grandeur, in the midst of
their fallen companions, with the mountains
in the background and the river rolling at
their feet, they sit, their hands upon their
knees, gazing eastward, as if proud of their

They are said to be, by the measurement of
' Sir 'Gardiner Wilkinson, eighteen feet three
inches across the shoulders; sixteen feet six
inches from the top of the shoulder to the elbow;
ten feet six' inches from the top of the head to
the shoulder; seventeen feet nine inches from
the elbow to the ﬁngers’ end; and nineteen feet
eight inches from the knee to the plant of the foot. -

talking of the strange story which is told of

one—that called the “ Vocal Memnon.”
