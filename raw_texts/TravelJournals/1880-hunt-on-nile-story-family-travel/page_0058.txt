60 A RIDE TO THE PYRAMIDS.

“Ah,” said Grace, “I shall be lost in a
sun-dream many times while we stay in this
country.”

So, advancing, the heavily-foliaged acacias
bowered them with their waving shadows;
they fringed and arched the long road, and
through their trunks at last the pyramids
stood out sculptured sharply against the sky,
looming in the faint haze of noon.

They had left the pleasant road now, and
were struggling through the heavy sand, which
is ever drifting, drifting here around these
memorials of a past age.

There are three pyramids at Ghizeh, the
largest of which towers nearly ﬁve hundred
feet above the sand. At last our travellers
stood at its base, and looked up at its vast
proportions.

“ Isn’t it wonderful how those ancient
masons laid these great blocks in order ? ”
said Mollie.

“ It is indeed,” replied her father. “ Some
of them are thirty feet in length, and many
are three feet or more in height.”
