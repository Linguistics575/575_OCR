A VISIT T0 HELIOPOLIS. ll

“ Now, Yusuf, I shall want you again,” said
he, dismounting, and paying his fare. “ What
is the little fellow’s name ’9 ”

“ I haven’t named him yet,” said Yusuf ;
and as he wended his way towards the Mouski
he began to feel the necessity of naming his
companion. Just as he was passing the opera-
house belonging to the Khediv’e, he encoun-
tered Abdallah: the two boys began to laugh,
and exchanged greetings. It takes an Arab
a long time to say, “ How do you do '4” At
length, when the salaam was ﬁnished, Abdallah
said,-— "

“ So you have gained my customer! well,
So let it be; it is thus that fate decrees.
Your donkey is a ﬁne fellow; what is his
name '§ ”'

“ That’s just what I’m trying to ﬁnd out,”
said Yusuf, as the boys sat down under a
spreading acacia-tree to eat their lunch of
coarse brown Arab bread and a handful of
dates.

“ I wish you’d tell me a name. What’s
your donkey’s '9 ”
