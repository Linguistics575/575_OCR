MOTHER-L0 7E. 149

Two little snowy cheeks
Dimple-dented never more;
Two little trodden shoes
That will never touch the ﬂoor;
Shoulder-ribbon softly twisted,
Apron folded, clean and white—
These are left me, and these only,
Of the childish presence bright.

“ Thus He sent an answer to my earnest praying;

Thus He keeps my darling free from earthly stain;

Thus He folds the pet lamb safe from earthly straying:
But I miss her sadly from the window pane—-

Till I look above it; then, with purer vision,
Sad I weep no longer the lilac-bush to pass,

For I see her angel, pure and white and sinless,
Walking with the harpers by the sea of glass.

“ Two little mmny wings
Softly ﬂutter to and fro;
Two tiny childish hands
Beckon still to me below;
Two tender angel eyes
Watch me very earnestly;
Through the loopholes of the stars
Baby’s looking out for me.”

“Thank you, dear,” said Mrs. Armstrong
calmly. “ I love to hear you sing. And now
I must not keep you up longer, else your
eyes will not be so bright and clear.” And
soon Mrs. Cliﬂ'ord heard the footsteps she so
loved crossing the plank of one boat and com-
ing over the other; then the words, “ Good
night ; ” and a moment afterwards two kisses
fell on her lips with “ Good night, mamma.”
