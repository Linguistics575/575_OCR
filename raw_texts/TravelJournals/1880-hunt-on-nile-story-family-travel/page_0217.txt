WHY-HUNTING AT THERE-S.

As they gazed upon that dead face, Colonel
Dayton, in his deep rich voice, read aloud that
fascinating poem of Horace Smith’s—an

ADDRESS TO A WY.

“Andthon hastwalked about—how strange a story !—
In Thebes’ streets. three thousand years ago,
When the Memnonium was in all its glory,
Andtimehadnotbeguntooverthrow
Those temples, palaces, and piles stupendous,
Ofwhichtheveryrninsaretremendous!

“ Speak! for thou long enough hast acted dummy;
Thou hast a tongue—come, let us hear its tune.
Thou’rt standing on thy legs above ground, mummy !
Revisiting the glimpses of the moon—
Not like thin ghosts, or disembodied creatures,
But with thy bones and ﬂesh and limbs and features.

“ Tell us—for doubtlem thou canst recollect—
To whom should we assign the Sphinx’s fame 2
Was Cheops or Cephrenes architect
Of either pyramid that bears his name 2
Is Pompey's Pillar really a misnomer?
Had Thebes a hundred gates, as sung by Homer?

“ Perchanee that very band, now pinioned ﬂat,
Has hob-a-nobbed with Pharaoh, glass to glam ;
Or dropped a halfpenny in Homer’s hat;
Or doﬂed thine own to let Queen Dido pass;
Or held, by Solomon’s own invitation,
A torch at the great Temple’s dedication.

“ Thou couldst develop, if that withered tongue
Might tell us what those sightless orbs have seen,
How the world looked when it was fresh and young,
And the great deluge still had left it green;
Or was it then so old that history’s pages
Contained no record of its early ages?
