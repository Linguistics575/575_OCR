YUSUF’S PRA YER. 191

“ Oh that he might be spared to come to
the Saviour,” prayed Grace, one morning after
the dahabeyehs had been moored at the shore
of Luxor, amid a cluster of other boats ﬂing-
ing out their national ﬂags to the breeze, while
all along the shore groups of natives held out
their curiosities and antiques to sell, and
donkey-boys waited for exploring travellers.
That ﬁrst night at Luxor would never be for-
gotten by the inmates of the Princess and Lulu ,-
for they had all come to love Harry Gordon
during this voyage, and felt what a loss it
would be to them if he should die.

Mr. Clifford sat all night by the sick young
man; and on board the Princess, Mollie and
Grace slept uneasily, waking every now and
then, and listening anxiously.

Once Grace, hearing her mother moving about
her state-room, went softly over to her door.

“ O mamma,” she said, “ I wish it was
morning. Do you think he will die? It is
so terrible to die so far from home; and here,
among these rock—tombs, death seems more sad
than anywhere else.”
