SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY. By the late Camus Hones, D.D., Pro-
fe-or in the Theological Seminary, Princeton, New Jersey. Three Vols.
Boya18v0.Prlce£2,2s. IndexVoL, 8s. 6d. extra.

“ The ‘ " ......... and lucidity of this work make it an invaluable
book of reference to every student of Biblical Theology. If we were called
to name any living writer who, to Calvin‘s exegetical tact, unites a large
measure of Calvin’s grasp of mind and transparent clearness in the depart-
ment of systematic theology, we should point to this Princeton Professor.
He possesses, to use the words of an English critic, the power of seizing and
retaining with a rare vigour and tenacity the great doctrinal turning-points
in a controversy; while he is able to expose with triumphant dexterity the
various subterfuges under which it has been sought to elude them."

“ Since the ﬁrst publication of this book, the evidences of the fact that it
met a public need have been multiplying. Its sale in Great Britain and
America has continued. It has been translated into Welsh and Modern
Greek, and used in several theological training-schools. It is again oﬂered
to the Christian Church, not as a complete treatise of Systematic Theology,
for the use of the proﬁcient, but as a simple Text-Book, adapted to the needs
of students taking their ﬁrst lessons in this great science, and to the con-
venience of many earnest workers who wish to refresh their memories by
means of a summary review of the ground gone over by them in their
earlier studies."-—Auﬂwr's Preface.
