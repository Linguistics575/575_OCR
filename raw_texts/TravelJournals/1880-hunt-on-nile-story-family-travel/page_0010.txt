10 A VISIT T0 H ELI OPOLIE.

Yusuf led his donkey to the crestfallen Turk,
who was hastily restoring his turban to -its
proper place, and as gravely as if nothing had
happened, said,— .

“ Do you want a donkey, sir ? ”

“ Maloom ! ” said the man, and was soon
seated in the saddle. The word “ maloom ” is
, translated “ certainly ; ” but it always seemed
to me to express a great deal more than that,
embracing the whole story preceding the ex-
clamation, and sometimes conveying a quaint
humour indescribable.

“ Ah!” said the Turk, with a guttural artic-
ulation of satisfaction, “ this is a good donkey;
my feet do not touch the ground at every step,
and he is not so crazy as the other. What is
your name ? ” '

“ Yusuf,” said the boy, breathing hard as he
ran beside the donkey.

“ Good,” replied the man, and suddenly
reined in the animal at the door of a large
house with latticed windows, and a wide garden
ﬁlled with orange-trees and ﬂowers of every
description.
