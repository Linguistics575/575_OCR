939 GOOD-B YE 1'0 EGYPT.

“ It seems almost as if Oriental life had been
petriﬁed into immutability, to prove for ever
the wonderful truthfulness of the Scriptures,”
said Colonel Dayton, thoughtfully.

“ I shall always feel thankful for this jour-
ney,” said Grace; “it has given me such an
insight into Oriental customs, and also into
missionary life, with all its trials and dangers.
. I often used to put missionaries a little above
ordinary Christians, but I ﬁnd that they have
their temptations like myself, with this differ-
ence, I have greater external aids to help me
through than they have. I shall pray for
them with very different feelings from what I
used to.” '

“ There is one more picture that I want
Miss Mollie to see,” said Colonel Dayton.
“ Who is that woman, the one with the bread
and water-bottle, leading a beautiful boy ’9 ”

“ I cannot tell,” said Mollie, looking ear-
nestly at the ﬁgures passing; “can you, Grace ?”

But Grace could not, and Harry Gordon
declared that if they failed it was of no use for
him to try.
