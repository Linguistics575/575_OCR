THE CHAMELE'ON. 35

rak saiid, yer sitt” (Good morning, ladies).
“ His name is Hassan. It seems so queer to
call him by clapping our hands, instead of
using a bell.”

“ Yes,” said Mollie, smiling a greeting to
her. father, who was” coming to meet them;
“ we have many strange experiences here.”

“ Our little Arab donkey-boy is waiting in
the porch, girls, with the chameleon he promised
yesterday,” said their father, as they rose from
the breakfast-table and went out into the pure,
soft air. In front of the hotel is a large stone
platform covered with an awning, and elevated
about six feet above the street, with which it
is connected by steps. Here you may ﬁnd the
native pedlers all day, with their antiques and
curiosities, while a crowd of donkey-boys line
the street, waiting for passengers.

Mollie and Grace hastened out to where
Abdallah stood with the promised chameleon.

He carried it in his hand by means of a
string tied tightly to the poor creature’s tail,
and exhibited it to the different persons in the
porch with much satisfaction.
