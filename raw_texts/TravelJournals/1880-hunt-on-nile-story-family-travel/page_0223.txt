238 GOOD-B YE TO 30 YPT.

“ Do you think, Colonel Dayton,” said Mol-
lie, “that he will be willing to work and
study? You see he has a great deal of labour
before him if he enters the ministry, and it
seems to me that the Arabs are a lazy race of
people; even Yusuf, who tries hard to do right,
likes better to sit and suck sugar-cane than to
wor .” i

“ Now, Mollie, don’t be hard on the boy,”
said Grace; “ remember he is but a child.
What child in the whole of 'America wouldn’t
rather do that than go to work 3 ”

“ The Arabs are Constitutionally lazy, ‘I’ll
admit,” said Colonel Dayton, Smiling; “ but,
Miss Mollie, yOu’ve noticed how cheerfully the
sailors go to their tasks, towing us along the
river, furling 'the sails, or performing any tasks
assigned to them; Yet when there is nothing
in particular to be done they’ll go to sleep, or
lie on their backs and suck sugar-cane by the
hour. So I think it will be with Yusuf. Let
him once know what his work is and he’ll do

it. If an Arab has anything to do, he does it
' with his might.”
