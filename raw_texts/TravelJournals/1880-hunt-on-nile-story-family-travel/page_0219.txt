CHAPTER XX.

GOOD-BYE T0 EGYPT.

_ * T was their last morning at Thebes.
i The shore of Luxor looked quite
m deserted, for many of the dahabe-
yehs had departed, and the Lulu and Princess
were almost the last to go.

Mrs. Armstrong and Mrs. Clifford were
both busy in their state-rooms, looking over
their wardrobes, sewing on a few stray buttons,
and laying aside dresses to be worn in Cairo.
Mr. Clifford had gone shooting with some gen-
tlemen from a neighbouring dahabeyeh. The
professor was still engaged in searching for
antiques; and the young people alone sat on
deck under the awning, chatting lightly, and
watching the shore.

â€œ So this is our last morning at Thebes,"
