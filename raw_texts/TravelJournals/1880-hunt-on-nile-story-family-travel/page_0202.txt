CHAPTER XVIII.

THE MEMNON IU M STATUES.

'* HE Nile party were wandering among
* the ruins of the Memnonium. This

 

- was a temple built to Rameses II.,
measuring four hundred feet by one hundred
and ﬁfty. Its ruins now loom grandly before
the traveller’s vision as he approaches those
ancient walls.

Lofty propyla, closely sculptured, form the
entrance to the ﬁrst court, whose walls are all
broken down; but the second court, with its
columns and the broken colossal statue pros-
trate at their base, exhibits a striking specimen
of Egyptian architecture.

Beyond this the travellers wandered into the
grand hall, and looked up to the solid roof
“ studded with stars on an azure ground.”
