192 YUSUF’S PRA YER.

“ We cannot tell, dear,” said her mother.
“ God will do what is best; we are sure of
that. We will pray for our dear friend, and
trust our Lord. And now, my darling child,
go back to your bed and try to sleep.”

Grace went back, but sleep did not come;
and when the ﬁrst streak of daylight showed
itself, she went on deck, the cool morning air
blowing refreshingly in her face, and bringing
hope to her heart. All was silent on the Lulu.
The lights in the cabins shone out feebly over
the waters.

“ Is it life or death ?” said Grace sadly, as
she leaned on the railing and looked wearily
over the dark river.

“ Miss Grace!” said a low voice; and'turn-
ing, Grace saw Yusuf coming across the plank.

“ Me watchy all night,” he said eagerly,
“ like dog by his cabin-door. He better—he
better!” .

“ What!” exclaimed Grace ; “is Mr. Gordon
better? Are you sure? How do you know?
Who told you ?”

“ Yes, yes, lady,” said Yusuf reassuringly.
