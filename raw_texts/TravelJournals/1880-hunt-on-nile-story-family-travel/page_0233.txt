Mr. and Mrs. Cliﬂ'ord are arranging their
wraps and valises for the comfort of the jour-
ney, talking cheerquy to Yusuf, to whom this
hour of departure is a heavy cross; but the
Saviour is looking down into that little heart
with all his precious promises, saying to him,
as his native land vanishes from his sight,
“ When thy father and mother forsake thee,
then the Lord Will take thee up.”

Yusuf ’3 story ends for us here, but for him
begins a new life—a life full of struggle, temp-
tation, prayer, and victories—yet one that we
know Christ will guard until at last he re-
ceives him to himself, in his home beyond
the river, with the sweet words of welcome :—

“ He that confesseth me before men, him
will I also confess before my Father which is

in heaven.”
