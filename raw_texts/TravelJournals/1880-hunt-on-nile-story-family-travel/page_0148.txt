150 MOTHER-L0 VE.

“ Grace,” said Mollie, as she unbraided her
hair for the night, “ how Professor Armstrong
felt that song; he could not stay to hear it.
How deeply he mourns for his child. Don’t
you think he seems to care more than Mrs.
Armstrong does? She seems so merry and
light-hearted. How old is she, I wonder ’2 ”

“ I think Mr. Gordon told me one day
that she is twenty-two,” said Grace, sitting
on the edge of her berth and folding her sash.
“ N o, Mollie, I don’t agree with you in regard
to Professor Armstrong’s sorrow being greater
than his wife’s. He is not a Christian, and is
groping in the darkness, but tries to drown
his grief; in his studies. How devoted he is
to science! His wife is cheery, I know; but
it is through the help of Him who sent her
the sorrow. Two years have passed since
their child died, but I think I never saw such
a look of pain as passed over her face when
she whispered to me at parting to-night, ‘ Pray
for me, Grace.’ We don’t know what a
mother’s love is. I suppose there is no love
in the world to equal it in intensity and depth.”
