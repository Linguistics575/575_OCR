98 A OOPHO' WEDDING.

there was a perfect storm of music and ap-
plause. Four priests ofﬁciated at this strange
wedding, but three of them were blind, and
these ﬁlled the air with incense and muttered
unintelligible prayers.

Mollie declared afterwards that she was
“ never so incensed in her life.”

At last the priest who could see bound the
waiting couple together with several yards
of tape, then knocked their heads together,
and ﬁnally placed his hands heavily on their
foreheads, bestowed upon them his blessing,
and the marriage was concluded.

Our friends were glad to be out in the open
air again, for the ceremony had lasted some
time, and the air within had become almost
unbreathable. Mollie and Grace were so ex-
cited with the tumult and novelty. of the
affair, that it was daylight before they fell
asleep, and then it was only to dream con-
fusedly of brides, blind priests, and dead sheep.
