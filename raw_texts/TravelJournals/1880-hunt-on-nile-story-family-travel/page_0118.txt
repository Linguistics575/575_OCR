120 A PEEP INTO A. HAREJI.

gentleman who declared New York could put
up a pyramid in Central Park, in two weeks,
that would beat old Che0ps’ tomb all to noth-
ing; and though they didn’t like to say so,
Mollie and Grace privately agreed that the
Mahmal was a humbug.

“ Come, ladies,” cried a merry voice that
afternoon, coming suddenly into Mrs. Clifford’s
parlour, “ dress yourselves in gorgeous array,
and we will visit an Egyptian harem.” And
the cheery little visitor, long a resident of
Cairo, spread out her ﬂounces and sat down to
wait for the ladies to make themselves ready.

“ Mayn’t I go too ? ” said Mr. Clifford, with
a smile. i

“ Oh no, sir!” laughed the lady, putting up
her hands in mock astonishment and horror.
“Fancy a gentleman demanding admittance to
an Egyptian harem! Ah, sir, you can have
your Masonic secrets and all that, but there is
one thing in which we can triumph over you,
and that is, we can penetrate the mysteries of

an Egyptian home when you dare not cross its

threshol .”
