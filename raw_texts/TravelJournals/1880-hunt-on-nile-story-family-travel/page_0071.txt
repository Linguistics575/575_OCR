CHURCHES AND MOSQ UES. 73

“ They are Orientals by birth, who, while
deeply attached to the ceremonies of the
Greek Church, have come to prefer the doc-
trines of the Church of Rome ; and thus, while
they retain all the outside marks of the Greek
Church, they place themselves under the au-
thority of the Pope, and adopt the Romish
fait .”

“ I suppose the native Church of Egypt is
the Coptic,” said Mrs. Cliﬁ'ord.

“ Yes; and the Copts are said to be the
native Egyptians. Their style of features and
general shape of the head bear a striking re-
semblanCe to the sculptures and pictures of
the ancient Egyptians on the walls of the
temples and tombs. They are very proud of
their antiquity.”

“ I have heard the COpts denounced as
wholly debased and degraded,” said Mr. Clif-
ford; “ but it seems to me that the very
fact of their holding fast to their religion, in
the midst of the persecution and scorn which
so long have followed them, shows that they
are not without principle.” ’
