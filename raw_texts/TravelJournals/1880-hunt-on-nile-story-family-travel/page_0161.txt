PHILAE AT SUNRISE. 165

through them all the two dahabeyehs were
towed along, until they anchored near the
island of Philae. ‘

Mollie and Grace had planned to join the
party on the Lulu, and visit Philae at sunrise ; ,
but Yusuf, who was engaged to waken them,
had a difﬁcult task before him. About half-
past four he came softly along the passage, and
gave a very gentle knock at the young ladies’
door. All was still. By-and-by he knocked
again, this time a little louder. N 0 response.
Then he shook the door. Still no sound from
the other side. Poor Yusuf was in despair.

“ Dey tell me wake ’em; but I do dat, how
if dey no wake ’9” he said, his teeth chattering
with cold. “ Dere, take dat ! ” and he gave a
succession of raps which might have been heard
a long way off. “ Me wake every one else but
dem,” he said, casting a rueful glance at the
other state-mom.

Ah, there is a sound.

“ What’s the matter '9 ” says a voice inside.

“ 0 Miss Mollie, what for you no wake?
