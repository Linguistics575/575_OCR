60 A RIDE TO THE PYRAMIDS.

come after that dismal place and noisome at-
mosphere.

After a little rest they walked towards the
sphinx, and long stood gazing on that mon-
ster of the desert crouching in the sands,
which ever drift against its sides and will not .
be stayed.

The sphinx is carved out of the living rock,
excavated for the purpose to a depth of more
than sixty feet ; it is compounded of the bust
of a man with the body and legs of a lion. This
combination is supposed to symbolize the union
of intellect and power required in a king. The
ﬁgure lies with its face towards the Nile, gaz-
ing out into the east as if awaiting some mys—
terious summons. The height, from the crown
of the head to the platform between the paws,
is sixty-two feet; the body is one hundred
and forty-three feet in length, and the paws
protrude ﬁfty feet more.

“ Ah,” said Colonel Dayton, “ man may
strive to excavate and explore around this
half-buried form; but while he sleeps, the sand
drifts back and buries the giant paws again.”
