,;——._———._

 

Shepherd’s Hotel. A party of some forty or ﬁfty wild-
looking Dervishes were squatting in a circle at the
opposite side of the hall, their outer caftans and queer
pyramidal hats lying in a heap close by.

Being accommodated with chairs among the other
spectators, we waited for whatever might happen. More
Dervishes and more English dropped in from time to
time. The new Dervishes took off their caps and sat
down among the rest, laughing and talking together at I
their case. The English sat in a row, shy, uncomfort-
able, and silent; wondering whether they ought to behave
as if they were in church, and mortally ashamed of their
feet. For we had all been obliged to take off or cover
our boots before going in, and those who had forgotten
to bring slippers had their feet tied up in pocket-hand-
kerchiefs.

A long time went by thus. At last, when the
number of Dervishes had increased to about seventy, and
every one was tired of waiting, eight musicians came in
-—two trumpets, two lutes, a cocoa-nut ﬁddle, a tam-
bourine, and two drums. Then the Dervishes, some of
whom were old and white-haired, and some mere boys,
formed themselves into a great circle, shoulder to
shoulder. The band struck up a plaintive, discordant
air. And a grave middle-aged man, placing himself in
the centre of the ring and inclining his head at each
repetition, began to recite the name of Allah.
