fours—women cooking at clay ovens in the open air—
cows and sheep feeding—poultry scratching and pecking
—dogs basking in the sun. The huts look more like
the lairs of prairie-dogs than the dwellings of human
beings. The little mosque with its one dome and stunted
minaret, so small, so far below, looks like a clay toy.
Beyond the village, which reaches far and wide, lie
barley ﬁelds, and cotton patches, and palm-groves,
bounded on one side by the river, and on the other by
the desert. A broad road, dotted over with moving
specks of men and cattle, cleaves its way straight through
the cultivated land and out across the sandy plain beyond.
\Ve can trace its course for miles where it is only a
trodden track in the desert. It goes, they tell us, direct
to Cairo. On the opposite bank glares a hideous white
sugar-factory; and, bowered in greenery, a country villa
of the Khedive. The broad Nile ﬂows between. The
sweet Theban hills gleam through a pearly haze on the
horizon.

All at once, a ﬁtful breeze springs up, blowing in
little gusts and swirling the dust in circles round our
feet. At the same moment, like a beautiful spectre,
there rises from the desert close by an undulating semi-
transparent stalk of yellow sand, which grows higher
every moment, and begins moving northward across the
plain. Almost at the same instant, another appears a
long way off towards the south, and a third comes gliding.
