that Egyptian discipline was strict, and that the soldier
who transgressed was as abjectly subject to the rule of
stick as his modern descendant. In no less than three
places do we see this time-honoured institution in full
operation, the superior ofﬁcer energetically ﬂourishing
his staff; the private taking his punishment with charac-
teristic disrelish. In the middle of the camp, watched
over by his keeper, lies Rameses’ tame lion; while close
against the royal pavilion a hostile spy is surprised and
stabbed by the ofﬁcer on guard. .The pavilion itself is
very curious. It is evidently not a tent but a building,
and was probably an extemporaneous construction of
crude brick. It has four arched doorways, and contains
in one corner an object like a cabinet, with two sacred
hawks for supporters. This object, which is in fact
almost identical with the hieroglyphic emblem used to
express a royal panegyry or festival, stands, no doubt,
for the private oratory of the King. Five ﬁgures kneel
before it in adoration.

To enumerate all or half the points of interest in
this amazing picture would ask altogether too much
space. Even to see it, with time at command and all
the help that candles and magnesian torches can give, is
far from easy. The relief is unusually low, and the
surface, having originally been covered with stucco, is
purposely roughened all over with tiny chisel-marks,
which painfully confuse the details. Nor is this all.
