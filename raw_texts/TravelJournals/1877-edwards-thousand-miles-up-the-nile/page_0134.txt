River for twenty miles space there was nothing but
ruines.” Since then, however, the very “mines” have
vanished; the palms have had time to grow; and
modern Cairo has doubtless absorbed all the building
material that remained from the middle ages.

Everything we know about the early history of Mem-
phis comes from Herodotus ; and it is satisfactory to ﬁnd
that in this, as in other instances, modern science is con-
stantly testifying to the accuracy of his facts, even when
they are most remote and least credible. That Menes
six or seven thousand years ago should have turned the
course of the Nile to create a site for his new city seems
only a little more improbable than that Lake Moeris
should have been dug by another Pharaoh of the Ancient
Empire (Amenemhat III.) to receive and store the super-
ﬂuous waters of the inundations. Both undertakings
appear too vast for the power and knowledge of even the
pyramid builders. Yet Linant Bey has not long since
discovered the dyke of Menes at Kosheysh, where there
is a great bend in the river, and the dyke of Moeris in
the central plateau of the Fyoom. These things are the
romance of archaeology. They bring us as it were face
to face with persons and events appertaining to a past so
inﬁnitely remote that they seem to belong to another
world than ours, and to other conditions of being.

Memphis is a place to read about, and think about,
and remember; but it is a disappointing place to see.
