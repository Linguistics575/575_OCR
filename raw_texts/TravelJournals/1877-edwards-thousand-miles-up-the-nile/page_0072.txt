Mahmal represented the litter of the Sultan, and went
empty, like a royal carriage at a public funeral; but we
were told that it now carried the tribute-carpet sent
annually by the carpet-makers of Cairo to the tomb
of the Prophet.

This closed the procession. As the camel passed
the crowd surged in, and everything like order was at an
end. The carriages all made at once for the Gate, so
meeting the full tide of the outpouring crowd and
causing unimaginable confusion. Some stuck in the
sand half-way—our own among the number; and all got
into an inextricable block in the narrow part just inside
the gate. Hereupon the drivers abused each other,
and the crowd got impatient, and some Europeans got
pelted.

Coming back, we met two or three more regiments.
The men, both horse and foot, seemed fair average
specimens, and creditably disciplined. They rode better
than they marched, which was to be expected. The
uniform is the same for cavalry and infantry throughout
the service; the only difference being that the former
wear short black riding boots, and the latter, Zouave
gaiters of white linen. They are ofﬁcered up to a
certain point by Egyptians; but the commanding ofﬁcers
and the staff (among whom are enough colonels and
generals to form an ordinary regiment) are chiefly
EurOpeans and Americans.
