his prime. We divine the rest; and the poetry of the
place at all events is ours. Even in these barren soli-
tudes there is wafted to us a breath from the shores of
old romance. We feel that Love once passed this way,
and that the ground is still hallowed where he trod.

We hurried on to the Great Temple, without waiting
to examine the lesser one in detail. A solemn twilight
reigned in the ﬁrst hall, beyond which all was dark.
Eight colossi, four to the right and four to the left, stand
ranged down the centre, bearing the mountain. on their
heads. Their height is twenty—ﬁve feet. With hands

Hathor, there is, if not positive beauty according to our western notions,
much sweetness and much grace. The name of Ncy'rean' means
Perfect, Good, or Beautiful Companion. That the word qure or
Nefcr should mean both Good and Beautiful—in fact, that Beauty
and Goodness should be synonymous terms—is not merely interesting
as it indicates a lofty philosophical standpoint, but as it reveals, per-
haps, the latent germ of that doctrine which was hereafter to be
taught with such brilliant results in the Alexandrian Schools. It is
remarkable that the word for Truth and Justice (Ala) was also one and
the same.

There is often a quaint signiﬁcance about Egyptian proper names
which reminds one of the names that came into favour in England
under the Commonwealth. Take for instance Bab-m Kimmy,
Servant-of-Khons ; Pa-du-amm, the Gift of Ammon ; Renpitmy’re,
Good-year ; [WM-en 2791M, Worth-her-Weight-in-Gold (both women’s
names); and Ear-mes-ouf-a-Slzu, Horus-son-of-the-Eye-of-Shu—which
last, as a tolerably long compound, may claim relationship with Praise-
God Barebones, Hew-Agag—in Pieces-before-the- Lord, etc. etc.
