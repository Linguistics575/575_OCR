necklaces and pectoral ornaments abound, are for
the most part of a kind that we have not seen
before. In one place the King presents to Isis a
column with four capitals, having on the top capital
a globe and two asps surmounted by a pair of ostrich
feathers.

The centre sanctuary of the seven appears to be
dedicated to Khem, who seems to be here, as in the
great Temple of Seti at Karnak, the presiding divinity.
In this principal sanctuary, which is resplendent with
colour and in marvellous preservation, we especially
observed a portrait of Rameses II.1 in the act of open-
ing the door of a shrine by means of a golden key
formed like a‘ human hand and arm. The lock seems
to consist of a number of bolts of unequal length,
each of which is pushed back in turn by means of the
foreﬁnger of the little hand. This, doubtless, gives a
correct representation of the kind of locks in use at
that time.

It was in a corridor opening out from the great hall
in this Temple that M. Mariette discovered that precious
sculpture known as the New Tablet of Abydus. In

‘ Rameses II. is here shown with the side-lock of youth. This
Temple, founded by Seti I., was carried on through the time when
Rameses the prince was associated with his father upon the throne.
The building is strictly coeval in date and parallel in style with the
Temple of Goornah and the Speos of Bayt-el-Wely.
