are perhaps instances in which I should have preferred
a different rendering; but it seemed to me that in follow-
ing Murray, I best consulted the convenience of the
general reader.

Touching the title of this book, it may be objected
that the distance from the port of Alexandria to the
Second Cataract falls short of a thousand miles. It is,
in fact, calculated at 964.} miles. But from the Rock of
Abooseer, ﬁve miles above Wady Halfeh, the traveller
looks over an extent of country far exceeding the thirty
or thirty-ﬁve miles necessary to make up the full tale of
a thousand. We distinctly saw from this point the
summits of mountains which lie about 145 miles to the
southward of Wady Halfeh, and which look down upon
the Third Cataract.

Perhaps I ought to say something in answer to the
repeated inquiries of those who looked for the publica-
tion of this volume a year ago. I can, however, only
reply that the Writer, instead of giving one year, has
given two years to the work. To write rapidly about
Egypt is impossible. The subject grows with the book,
and with the knowledge one acquires by the way. It is,
moreover, a subject beset with such obstacles as must
impede even the swiftest pen; and to that swiftest pen
I lay no claim. Those who may by and by approach the
Nile and its monuments when Brugsch-Bey shall have
completed his new History of Egypt, will ﬁnd their path
