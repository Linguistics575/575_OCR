of the desert, we had neither time nor means to ascertain.
It was something, at all events, to have convinced our-
selves that the mounds were artiﬁcial.I

As we came away, we met a Nubian peasant trudg—_
ing northwards. He was leading a sorry camel; had a
white cockerel under his arm; and was followed by a
frightened woman, who drew her shawl over her face
and cowered behind him, at sight of the Ingleezeh.

We asked the man what the mounds were, and who
made them; but he shook his head, and said they had
been there “ from old time.” We then inquired by what
name they were known in these parts; to which, urging
his camel forward, he replied hesitatingly that they had
a name, but that he had forgotten it.

Having gone a little way, however, he presently
turned back, saying that he now remembered all about
it, and that they were called “ The Horns of Yackma.”

More than this we could not get from him. Who
Yackma was, or how he came to have horns, or why his
horns should take the form of tumuli, was more than he

could tell or we could guess.

‘ On referring to Col. H. Vyse’s Vo'yagc info Upper Egpl, etc., I
see that he also opened one of these tumuli, but “ found no indication of
an artiﬁcial construction.” I can only conclude that he did not carry
his excavation low enough. As it is difﬁcult to suppose the tumuli
made for nothing, I cannot help believing that they would repay a
more systematic investigation.
