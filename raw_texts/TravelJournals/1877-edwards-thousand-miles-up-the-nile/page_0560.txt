and displays in all its purity the ﬁrm and ﬂowing line of
Egyptian draughtsmanship.

The dress of the King is very rich in colour; the
mitre-shaped casque being of a vivid cobalt-blue1 picked
out with gold-colour; the belt, necklace, armlets, and
bracelets, of gold, studded apparently with precious
stones; the apron, green and gold. Over the King’s
head hovers the sacred vulture, emblem of Maut, holding

' The material of this blue helmet, so frequently depicted on
the monuments, may have been the Homeric Kuanos, about which
so much doubt and conjecture have gathered, and which Mr. Glad-
stone supposes to have been a metal—(See fuz'mtus Mandi, chap. xv.
p. 532.) A paragraph in The Academy (June 8, 1876) gives the fol-
lowing particulars of certain perforated lumps of a “ blue metallic
substance," discovered at Hissarlik by Dr. Schliemann, and there
found lying under the copper shields to which they had probably been
attached. “ An analytical examination by Landerer (Bag. Hiittenm.
Zeitung, xxxiv. 4 30) has shown them to be sulphide of copper. The
art of colouring the metal was known to the coppersmiths of Corinth,
who plunged the heated copper into the fountain of Peirene. It
appears not impossible that this was a sulphur spring, and that the
blue colour may have been given to the metal by plunging it in a
heated state into the water and converting the surface into copper
sulphide.”

It is to be observed that the Pharaohs are almost always repre-
sented wearing this blue helmet in the battle-pieces, and that it is
frequently studded with gold rings. It must therefore have been of
metal. If not of sulphuretted copper, it may have been made of steel,
which, in the well-known instance of the butcher’s sharpener, as well as
in representations of certain weapons, is always painted blue upon the
monuments.
