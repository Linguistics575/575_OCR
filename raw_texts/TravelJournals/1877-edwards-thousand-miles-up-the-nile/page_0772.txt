threshold of a fresh building, what one is likely to see in
the way of sculptures within. But almost every subject
in the Temple of Seti at Abydus is new and strange.
All the Gods of the Egyptian pantheon seem to have
been worshipped here, and to have had each his separate
shrine. The walls are covered with paintings of these
shrines and their occupants; while before each the King
is represented performing some act of adoration. A
huge blue frog, a greyhound, a double—headed goose, a
human-bodied creature with a Nilometer for its head,1
and many more than I can now remember, are thus
depicted. The royal offerings, too, though incense and

There is at the upper end of each of these seven sanctuaries a
singular kind of false door, or recess, conceived in a style of ornament
more Indian than Egyptian, the cutting being curiously square, deep,
and massive, the surface of the relief-work flattened, and the whole
evidently intended to produce its effect by depths of shadow in the
incised portions rather than by sculpturcsque relief. These recesses, or
imitation doors, may have been designed to serve as backgrounds to
statues, but are not deep enough for niches. There is a precisely
similar recess sculptured on one of the walls of the westernmost
chamber in the Temple of Goornah.

1 These are all representations of minor Gods commonly ﬁgured in
the funereal papyri, but very rarely seen in the Temple sculptures.
The frog Goddess, for instance, is Hek, and symbolises eternity. She
is a very ancient divinity, traces of her being found in monuments of
the Vth Dynasty. The goose-headed God is Seb, another very old God.
The object called the Nilometer was a religious emblem signifying
stability, and probably stands in this connection as only a deiﬁed
symbol.
