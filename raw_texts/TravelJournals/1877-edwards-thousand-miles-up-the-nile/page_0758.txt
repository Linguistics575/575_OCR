of the Egyptian peOple. In another ﬁfty years or so,
the Coptic will in all probability be superseded by the
Arabic in the services of this Church ; and then the very
tradition of its pronunciation will be lost. The Copts
themselves, it is said, are fast going over to the dominant
faith. Perhaps by the time our own descendants are
counting the two thousandth anniversary of the Christian
Era, both Copts and Coptic will be extinct in Egypt.

A day or two after this we dropped down to Karnak,
where we remained till the end of the week, and on the
following Sunday we resumed our downward voyage.

If the universe of literature was unconditioned, and
the present book was independent of time and space, I
would write.another chapter here about Karnak. But
Karnak, to be fairly dealt by, would ask, not a chapter,
but a volume. So, having already told something of the
impression ﬁrst made upon us by that wilderness of

wonders, I will say no more.
