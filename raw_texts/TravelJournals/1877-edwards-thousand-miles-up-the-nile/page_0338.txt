Cataract-Arab, alone possesses the key. At the time of
the inundation, when all but the highest rocks are under
water, and navigation is as easy here as elsewhere, the
Shellalee's occupation is gone. But as the ﬂoods sub-
side and travellers begin to reappear, his work com-

work; but he gets well paid for it, and his proﬁts are
always on the increase. From forty to ﬁfty Daha-
beeyahs are now annually taken up between November
and March; and every year brings a larger influx of
travellers. Meanwhile, accidents rarely happen; prices
tend continually upwards; and the Cataract Arabs make
a little fortune by their singular monopoly.

The scenery of the First Cataract is like nothing else
in the world—except the scenery of the Second. It is
altogether new, and strange, and beautiful. It is incom-
