These tombs in a general way are very much alike.

1

Some are longer than others; some loftier. In some

the descent is gradual; in others it is steep and sudden.
'Certain leading features are common to all. The great
serpent,2 the scarab,3 the bat‘ and the crocodile,5 are
always conspicuous on the walls. The judgment-scene,
and the well-known typical picture of the four races of
mankind, are continually reproduced. Some tombs,6

‘ The longest tomb in the valley, which is that of Seti 1., measures
470 feet in length to the point where it is closed by the falling in of
the rock; and the total depth of its descent is about 180 feet. The
tomb of Rameses III. (No. I 1) measures in length 405 feet, and
descends only 31 feet. The rest average from about 3 50 to 150 feet
in length, and the shortest is excavated to a distance of only 65 feet.

We visited, however, one tomb in the Assaseef, which in extent far
exceeds any of the tombs of the kings. This astonishing excavation,
which consists of a bewildering labyrinth of halls, passages, staircases,
pits, and chambers, is calculated at 23,809 square feet. The name of
the occupant was Petamunap, a priest of uncertain date.

9 Apop/ulv, in Egyptian Apap; the great serpent of darkness, over
whom Ra must triumph after he sets in the west, and before he again rises
in the east. 3 Kheper, the scarab deity. See Chap. VI. p. 147.

4 Symbolical of darkness.

5 The crocodile represents Sebek. In one of the Boulak papyri,
this God is called the son of Isis, and combats the enemies of Osiris.
Here he combats ApOphis in behalf of Ra.

‘3 The tomb numbered 3 in the ﬁrst small ravine to the left
as one rides up the valley, bears the cartouches of Rameses II. The
Writer crawled in as far as the choked condition of the tomb permitted,
but the passage becomes quite impassable after the ﬁrst thirty or forty
yards. See chap. XV. p. 410.
