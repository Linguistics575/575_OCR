THEBES T0 ASSO UAN. 253

 

governor’s list, and ﬁrst up the Cataract. And as the
passage of the Cataract is some two or three days’ work,
this little question of priority is by no means unimportant.
Not for ﬁve times the promised ‘ guinée’ would we have
the Fostat slip in ﬁrst, and so be kept waiting our turn on
the wrong side of the frontier.

And now, as the sun rises higher, so the race waxes
hotter. At breakfast time we were ﬁfteen miles from
Assouan. Now the ﬁfteen miles have gone down to ten ;
and when we reach yonder headland, they will have
dwindled to seven. It is plain to see, however, that as the
distance decreases between ourselves and Assouan, so
also it decreases between ourselves and the Fostat.
Re'l's Hassan knows it. I see him measuring the space
by his eye. I see the frown settling on his brow. He
is calculating how much the Fostat gains in every
"quarter of an hour, and how many quarters we are yet
distant from the goal. For no Arab sailor counts by
miles. He counts by time, and by the reaches in the
river; and these may be taken at a rough average of
three miles each. When, therefore, our captain, in reply
to an oft-repeated question, says we have yet two bends
to make, we know that we are about six miles from our
destination.

Six miles—and the Fostat creeping closer every
minute! Just now we were all talking eagerly; but as
the end draws near, even the sailors are silent. Reis
