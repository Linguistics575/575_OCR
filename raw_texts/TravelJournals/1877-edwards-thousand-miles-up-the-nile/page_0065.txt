The view from the outer platform is, however, mag-
niﬁcent. We saw it on a hazy day, and could not
therefore distinguish the point of the Delta, which ought
to have been visible on the north; but we could plainly
see as far southward as the Pyramids of Sakkarah, and
trace the windings of the Nile for many miles across the
plain. The Pyramids of Geezeh, on their dais of desert
rock about twelve miles off, looked, as they always do
look from a distance, small and unimpressive; but the
great alluvial valley dotted over with mud villages and
intersected with canals and tracts of palm forest; the
shining river specked with sails; and the wonderful city,
all ﬂat roofs, cupolas, and minarets, spread out like an
intricate model at one’s feet, were full of interest and
absorbed our whole attention. Looking down upon it
from this elevation, it is as easy to believe that Cairo
contains four hundred mosques, as it is to stand on the
brow of the Pincio and believe in the three hundred and
sixty-ﬁve churches of modern Rome.

As we came away, they showed us the place in which
the Memlook nobles, four hundred and seventy1 in num-

1 One only is said to have escaped—a certain Emeem Bey, who leaped
his horse over a gap in the wall, alighted safely in the piazza below,
and ga110ped away into the desert. The place of this famous leap
continued to be shown for many years, but there are no gaps in the
wall now, the citadel being the only place in Cairo that is kept in
thorough repair.
