doubt whether the Governor of Assouan had not re-
ported over-favourably of the health of the province.
The ceremonial, with its dancing and chanting, was
always much the same; always barbaric, and in the
highest degree artiﬁcial. One would like to know how
much of it is derived from purely African sources, and
how much from ancient Egyptian tradition. The dance
is most probably Ethiopian. Lepsius, travelling through
the Soudan in A.D. 1844,1 saw something of the kind at a
funeral in Wed Medineh, about half-way between
Sennaar and Khartoom. The white ﬁllet worn by the
choir of mourners is, on the other hand, distinctly
Egyptian. We afterwards saw it represented in paint-
ings of funeral processions on the walls of several tombs
at Thebes,2 where the wailing women are seen to be
gathering up the dust in their hands and casting it upon
their heads, just as they do now. As for the wail—
beginning high, and descending through a scale divided,
not by semi-tones, but thirds of tones, to a ﬁnal note
about an octave and a half lower than that from which it
started—it probably echoes to this day the very pitch
and rhythm of the wail that followed the Pharaohs to
their sepulchres in the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings.
