It may be that the traveller who ﬁnds himself for the
ﬁrst time in the midst of a grove of We/[z'ngtomb
gigantea feels something of the same overwhelming
sense of awe and wonder; but the great trees, though
they have taken three thousand years to grow, lack
the pathos and the mystery that comes of human
labour. They do not strike their roots through six
thousand years of history. They have not been watered
with the blood and tears of millions.1 Their leaves
know no sounds less musical than the singing of birds,
or the moaning of the night-wind as it sweeps over
the highlands of Calaveros. But every breath that
wanders down the painted aisles of Karnak seems to
echo back the sighs of those who perished in the
quarry, at the oar, and under the chariot-wheels of the
conqueror.

The Hypostyle Hall, though built by Seti, the father
of Rameses II., is supposed by some Egyptologists to
have been planned, if not begun, by that same Amen-
hotep III. who founded the Temple of Luxor and set up
the famous Colossi of the Plain. However this may be,
i the cartouches so lavishly sculptured on pillar and
architrave contain no names but those of Seti, who
undoubtedly executed the work an éloc, and of Rameses,
who completed it.

1 It has been calculated that every stone of these huge Pharaonic
temples cost at least one human life.
