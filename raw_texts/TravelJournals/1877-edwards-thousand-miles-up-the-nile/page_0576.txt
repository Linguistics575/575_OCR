So much by way of conjecture. As hypothesis,
however, a sufﬁcient reason is perhaps suggested for the
wonderful state of preservation in which the little
chamber had been handed down to the present time. A
rational explanation is also offered for the absence of
later cartouches, of Greek and Latin ex-votos, of
Christian emblems, and of subsequent mutilation of every
kind. For, save that one contemporary visitor—the son
' of the Royal Son of Cush—the place contained, when we
opened it, no record of any passing traveller; no
defacing autograph of tourist, archaeologist, or scientiﬁc
explorer. Neither Belzoni nor Champollion had found
it out. Even the sharp eyes of the terrible Lepsius had
passed it by.

It happens sometimes that hidden things, which in
themselves are easy to ﬁnd, escape detection because no
one thinks of looking for them. But such was not the
case in this present instance. Search had been made
here again and again; and even quite recently.

It seems that when the Khedive entertains distin-
guished guests and sends them in gorgeous Dahabeeyahs
up the Nile, he grants them a virgin mound, or so many
square feet of a famous necropolis ; lets them dig as deep
as they please; and allows them to keep whatever they
may ﬁnd. Sometimes he sends out scouts to beat the
ground; and then a tomb is found and left unopened,

and the illustrious visitor is allowed to discover it.
