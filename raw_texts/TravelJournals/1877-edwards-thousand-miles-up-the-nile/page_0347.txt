tically piled—of sand-slopes golden to the water's edge—
of placid pools low-lying in the midst of lupin-ﬁelds and
tracts of tender barley—of creeking Sakkiehs, half hidden
among palms and dropping water as they turn—of mud
dwellings, here clustered together in hollows, there perched
separately on heights among the rocks, and perpetuating
to this day the form and slope of Egyptian pylons—of
rude boats drawn up in sheltered coves, or going to pieces
high and dry upon the sands—of water-washed boulders
of crimson, and black, and purple granite, on which the
wild fowl cluster at mid-day and the ﬁsher spreads his
nets to dry at sunset—of camels, and caravans, and camps
on shore—of cargo-boats and cangias on the river—of
wild ﬁgures of half-naked athletes—of dusky women
decked with barbaric ornaments, unveiled, swift-gliding,
trailing long robes of deepest gentian blue—of ancient
crones, and little' naked children like live bronzes—of
these, and a hundred other subjects, in inﬁnite variety
and combination, there is literally no end. It is all so
picturesque, indeed, so biblical, so poetical, that one is
almost in danger of forgetting that the places are some-
thing more than beautiful backgrounds, and that the
people are not merely appropriate ﬁgures placed there
for the delight of sketchers, but are made of living ﬂesh
and blood, and moved by hopes, and fears, and sorrows,
like our own.
