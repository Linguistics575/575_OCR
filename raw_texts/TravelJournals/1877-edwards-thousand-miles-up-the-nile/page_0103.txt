Bedreshayn and the neighbouring village of Mitrahenny
had turned out in hot haste and rushed down to the
river; so that by the time breakfast was over there
were steeds enough in readiness for all the English in
Cairo. I pass over the tumult that ensued when our
party at last mounted the eight likeliest beasts and rode
away, leaving the indignant multitude to disperse at leisure.

And now our way lies over a dusty ﬂat, across the
railway line, past the long straggling village, and through
the famous plantations known as the Palms of Memphis.
There is a crowd of patient-looking Fellaheen at the
little whitewashed station, waiting for the train; and the
usual rabble of clamorous water, bread, and fruit sellers.
Bedreshayn, though a collection of mere mud hovels,
looks pretty, nestling in the midst of stately date-palms.
‘~ Square pigeomtowers, embedded round the top with
layers of wide-mouthed pots, and stuck with rows of
leaﬂess acacia-boughs like ragged banner-poles, stand
up at intervals among the huts. The pigeons go in and
out of the pots, or sit preening their feathers on the
branches. The dogs dash out and bark madly at us, as
we go by. The little brown children pursue us with
cries of “ Backsheesh l” The potter, laying out rows of
soft, grey, freshly-moulded clay bowls and goollahs1 to

1 The goollah, or kulleh, is a porous water-jar of sun-dried Nile mud.
These jars are made of all sizes and in a variety of remarkably
graceful forms, and cost from about one farthing to twopence apiece.
