 

494 DISC 0 VERIES AT A300 SIMBEL.

 

Having traced thus far the course of the excavations
and the way in which one discovery led step by step
to another, I must now return to the Speos, and, as

accurately as I can, describe it, not only from my notes
made on the spot, but by the light of such observa-
tions as I afterwards made among structures of the same
style and period. I must, however, premise that, not
being able to go inside while the excavators were in
occupation, and remaining but one whole day at Aboo
Simbel after the work was ended, I had but short time
at my disposal. I would gladly have made coloured
c0pies of all the wall-paintings; but this was impossible.
I therefore was obliged to be content with transcribing
the inscriptions and sketching a few of the more im-
portant subjects.

The rock-cut chamber which I have hitherto de-
scribed as a Speos, and which we at Ô¨Årst believed to be
a tomb, was in fact neither the one nor the other. It
was the adytum of a partly-built, partly-excavated
monument coeval in date with the Great Temple. In
Certain points of design this monument resembles the
contemporary Speos of Bayt e1 Welly. It is evident, for
instance, that the outer halls of both were originally
vaulted; and the much mutilated sculptures over the
doorway of the excavated chamber at Aboo Simbel are
almost identiCal in subject and treatment with those over

the entrance to the excavated parts of Bayt el Welly.
