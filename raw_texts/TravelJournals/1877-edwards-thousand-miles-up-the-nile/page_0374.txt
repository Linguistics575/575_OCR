The annexed woodcut, admirably faithful within its
limits, can do no more than reproduce the forms.

Architecturally, this portico is unlike any we have yet
seen, being open to the sky in the centre, like the atrium
of a Roman house. The light thus admitted glows over-
head, lies in a square patch on the ground below, and is
reflected upon the pictured recesses of the ceiling. At
the upper end, where the pillars stand two deep, there
was originally an intercolumnar screen. The rough sides
of the columns show where the connecting blocks have
been torn away. The pavement, too, has been pulled
up by treasure-seekers, and the ground is strewn with
broken slabs and fragments of shattered cornice.

These are the only signs of ruin—signs traced not
by the ﬁnger of Time, but by the hand of the spoiler.
So fresh, so fair is all the rest, that we are fain to cheat
ourselves for a moment into the belief that what we see
particularly, the mosaic pattern upon the throne of a divinity just over
the second doorway in the western wall ; and the designs upon a series
of other thrones a little farther along towards the north, all most deli-
cately drawn in uniform compartments, picked out in the three primary
colours, and laid on in ﬂat tints of wonderful purity and delicacy.
Among these a lotus between two buds, an exquisite little Sphinx on a
pale red ground, and a series of sacred hawks, white upon red, alter-
nating with white upon blue, all most exquisitely conventionalised, may
be cited as examples of absolutely perfect treatment and design in poly-

chrome decoration. A more instructive and delightful task than the

c0pying of these precious fragments can hardly be commended to
students and sketchers on the Nile.
