They seemed to lie upon the Eastern bank, but that was
an illusion which the map disproved, and which lasted
only till the great corner was fairly turned. To turn
that corner, however, in the teeth of wind and current,
was no easy task, and cost us two long days of hard
tracking.

At a point about ten miles below Denderah, we saw
some thousands of Fellaheen at work amid clouds of
sand upon the embankments of a new canal. They
swarmed over the mounds like ants, and the continuous
murmur of their voices came to us across the river like
the humming of innumerable bees. Others, following
the path along the bank, were pouring towards the spot
in an unbroken stream. The Nile must here be nearly
half-a-mile in breadth; but the engineers in European
dress, and the overseers with long sticks in their hands,
were plainly distinguishable by the help of a glass; while
the tents in which these ofÔ¨Åcials were camping out during
the progress of the work gleamed white among the palms
by the river-side. Such scenes must have been common
enough in the old days when a conquering Pharaoh,
returning from Libya or-the land of Cush, set his captives
to raise a dyke, or excavate a lake, or quarry a mountain.
The Israelites, building the massive walls of Pithom and
Rameses with bricksof their own making, must have
presented exactly such a spectacle.

That we were witnessing a case of forced labour,
