point of View. As decoration, it was necessary that they
should give size and dignity to the facade. Everything,
consequently, was here subordinated to the general effect
of breadth, of massiveness, of repose. Considered thus,
the colossi are a triumph of treatment. Side by side
they sit, placid and majestic, their feet a little apart, their
hands resting on their knees. Shapely though they are,
those huge legs look scarcely inferior in girth to the
great columns of Karnak. The articulations of the
knee-joint, the swell of the calf, the outline of the
peroneus longus are indicated rather than developed.
The toe-nails and toe-joints are given in the same bold
and general way; but the ﬁngers, because only the tips
of them could be seen from below, are treated en Mac.
The faces show the same largeness of style. The
little dimple which gives such sweetness to the corners
of the mouth, and the tiny depression in the lobe of
the ear, are in fact, circular cavities as large as saucers.
How far this treatment is consistent with the most
perfect delicacy and even ﬁnesse of execution, may be
gathered from the sketch. The nose there shown in
proﬁle is 3 feet and a half in length; the mouth so
delicately curved is about the same in width; even the
sensitive nostril, which looks ready to expand with the
breath of life, exceeds 8 inches in length. The ear
(which is placed high, and is well detached from the
.head) measures 3 feet and 5 inches from top to tip.
