some sixty feet of its yet visible surface. That surface
bears the tool-marks of the workmen. A slanting groove
pitted with wedge-holes indicates where it was intended
to taper towards the top. Another shows where it
was to be reduced at the side. Had it been ﬁnished,
this would have been the largest obelisk in the world.
The great obelisk of Queen Hatasu at Karnak, which, as
its inscriptions record, came also from Assouan, stands
ninety-two feet high, and measures eight feet square at
the base; but this which lies sleeping in the desert
would have stood ninety-ﬁve feet in the shaft, and have
measured over eleven feet square at the base. We can
never know now why it was left here,1 nor guess with

obelisk than was ever yet seen by eyes of men, and did
he die before the block could be extracted from the
quarry? Or were the quarrymen driven from the
desert, and the Pharaoh from his throne, by the hungry
hordes of Ethiopia, or Syria, or the islands beyond the
