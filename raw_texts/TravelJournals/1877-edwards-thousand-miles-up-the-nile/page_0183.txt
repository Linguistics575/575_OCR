of shaggy black buffaloes, up to their shoulders in the
river and dozing as they stand—a wide-spreading syca-
more-ﬁg, in the shade of which lie a man and camel
asleep—a fallen palm uprooted by the last inundation,
with its ﬁbrous roots yet clinging to the bank and its
crest in the water—a group of Sheykhs’ tombs with

RIVER-SIDE TOMBS NEAR SIOUT.

glistening white cupolas relieved against a background
of dark foliage—ﬂan old disused water-wheel lying up
sidewise against the bank like a huge teetotum, and
garlanded with wild tendrils of a gourd—such are a few
out of many bits by the way, which, if they offer nothing
very new, at all events present the old material under
fresh aspects, and in combination with a distance of such
ethereal light and shade, and such opalescent tenderness
of tone, that it looks more like an air-drawn mirage than
a piece of the world we live in.
