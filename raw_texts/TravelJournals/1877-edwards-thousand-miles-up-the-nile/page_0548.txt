bowls were taken, the bones of two skeletons all
detached, perfectly desiccated, and apparently complete.
' The remains were those of a child and a small grown
person--—probably a woman. The teeth were sound;
the bones wonderfully delicate and brittle. As for the
little skull (which had fallen apart at the sutures), it was
pure and fragile in texture as the cup of a water-lily.

We laid the bones aside as we found them, examining
every handful of sand, in the hope of discovering some-

a hundred years ago or a thousand.

We now called up all the crew, and went on excavat-
ing downwards into what seemed to be a long and
narrow vault measuring some ﬁfteen feet by three.

After-reﬂection convinced us that we had stumbled
upon a chance Nubian grave, and that the bowls (which
at ﬁrst we absurdly digniﬁed with the name of cinerary
urns) were but the usual water-bowls placed at the heads
of the dead. But we were in no mood for reﬂection
at the time. We made sure that the Speos was a
mortuary chapel ; that the vault was a vertical pit leading
to a sepulchral chamber; and that at the bottom of it we

perhaps, and sarcophagi, and funereal gods, and jewels,
