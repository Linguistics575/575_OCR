Kades;1 and it was hither that he returned in triumph
‘after the great victory. A contemporary letter written
by one Panbesa, a clerk, describes in glowing terms the
beauty and abundance of the royal city, and tells how
the damsels stood at their doors in holiday apparel, with
nosegays in their hands and sweet oil upon their locks,
“ on the day of the arrival of the War-God of the world.”
This letter is in the British Museum.2

Other letters written during the reign of Rameses II.
make direct mention of the Israelites.

“I have obeyed the orders of my master," writes the
scribe Kauiser to his superior Bak-en-Pthah, “ being
bidden to serve out the rations to the soldiers, and also
to the Hebrews who quarry stone for the palace of King
Rameses Mer—Ammon.” A similar document written by
a scribe named Keniamon, and couched in almost the
same words, shows them on another occasion to have

Herr Brugsch conjectures that the original Egyptian name may have
been Set-ro—lzata (The Land of the Mouths: tie. the Tanitic, Pelusiac,
and Mendesian Mouths of the Nile). The present writer ventures,
with the utmost difﬁdence, to submit that Sethroitc: may have been a
Greek rendering of S/zet-Hor. Pithom and Rameses being brought
down some thirty miles farther inland than Tanis, it follows also that
Serra—ham would cease to be an applicable derivation.

1 Kades, otherwise Katesh, Kadesh, or Atesch, a town on the
Orontes, identiﬁed by Brugsch with Cadytis.—See Geog. Inst/Inﬂux, taf.
xix. 105, I. Cadytis, according to some, was a name of the city of
Jerusalem.
