ever. The performances of the Ghawazee—which are
very ungraceful and almost wholly pantomimic—have
been too often described to need description here.
Only once, indeed, did we see them perform an actual
dance; and then they swam lightly to and fro, clattering
their castanets, crossing and re—crossing, and bounding
every now and then down the whole length of the room.
This dance, we were told, was of unknown antiquity.
They sang occasionally; but their voices were harsh
and their melodies inharmonious.

There was present, however, one native performer
whom we had already heard many times, and of whose
skill we never tired. This was the leader of the little
band—an old man who played the Kemengeh,1 or cocoa-
nut ﬁddle. A more unpromising instrument than the
Kemengeh it would be difﬁcult to conceive; yet our old
Arab contrived to make it discourse most eloquent
music. His solos consisted of plaintive airs and extem-
porised variations, embroidered with difﬁcult, and some-
times extravagant, cadenzas. He always began sedately,
but warmed to his work as he went on; seeming at last

to forget everything but his own delight in his own

1 The kemengeh is a kind of small two-stringed ﬁddle, the body of
which is made of half a cocoa-nut shell. It has a very long neck, and
a long foot that rests upon the ground, like the foot of a Violoncello;
and it is played with a bow about a yard in length. The strings are of
twisted horsehair.
