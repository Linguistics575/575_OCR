This was the longest speech we heard him make,
and he delivered it with some emphasis.

I then asked him if the Coptic was in all respects a
dead language; to which he replied that many Coptic
words, such as the names of the months and of certain
festivals, were still in daily use. This, however, was not
quite what I meant; so I put the question in another
form, and asked if he thought any fragments of the
tongue yet survived among the peasantry.

He pondered a moment before replying.

“ That,” he said, “is a question to which it is difﬁcult
to give a precise answer, but I think you might yet ﬁnd,

Champollion says, “La langue égyptienne antique ne différait en
rien de la langue appelée vulgairement Copte ou Cophte. . . . Les
mots égyptiens écrits en caractéres hieroglyphiques sur les monuments
les plus anciens de Thébes, et en caractéres Grecs dans les livres
C0ptes, ne diffe’rent en général que par l’absence de certaines voyelles
médiales omises, selon la méthode orientale, dans l’orthographe primi-
tive.”—Grammaz'rc Egyptz'enm, p. 18.

The Bishop, though perfectly right in stating that Coptic and
Egyptian were one, and that the Coptic was a distinct language having
no afﬁnity with the Greek, was, however, entirely wrong in that part of
his explanation which related to the alphabet. So far from eight Greek
letters having been added to the Coptic alphabet upon the introduction
of Christianity into Egypt, there was no such thing as a Coptic
alphabet previous to that time. The Coptic alphabet is the Greek
alphabet as imposed upon Egypt by the Fathers of the early Greek
Church; and that alphabet being found insufﬁcient to convey all the
sounds of the Egyptian tongue, eight new characters were borrowed
from the demotic to supplement the deﬁciency.
