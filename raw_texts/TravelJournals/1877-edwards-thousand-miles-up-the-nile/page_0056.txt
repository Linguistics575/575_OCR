It was still lengthening over the landscape as we
went down the long sand-slope and regained the carriage.
Some six or eight Arabs in ﬂuttering white garments ran
on ahead to bid us a last good-bye. That we should
have driven over from Cairo only to sit quietly‘down and
look at the Great Pyramid had ﬁlled them with unfeigned
astonishment. With such energy and despatch as the
modern traveller uses, we might have been to the t0p,
and seen the temple of the Sphinx, and done two or three
_ of the principal tombs in the time.

“You come again l" said they. “Good Arab show you
everything. You see nothing this time! ”

So, promising to return ere long, we drove away;
well content, nevertheless, with the way in which our
time had been spent.

The Pyramid Bedouins have been plentifully abused
by travellers and guide-books, but we found no reason to
complain of them now or afterwards. They neither
crowded round us, nor followed us, nor importuned us in
any way. They are naturally vivacious and very talka-
tive, yet the gentle fellows were dumb as mutes when
they found we wished for silence. And they were satis-
ﬁed with a very moderate backsheesh at parting.

As a ﬁtting sequel to this excursion, we went, I think
next day, to see the mosque of Sultan Hassan, which is
one of those mediaeval structures built with the casing
stones of the Great Pyramid.
