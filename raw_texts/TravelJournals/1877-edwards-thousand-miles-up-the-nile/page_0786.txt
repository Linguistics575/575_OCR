-—.—‘

used to be there, on foot or in carriages, between eight
o’clock and midnight every evening; the veiled ladies
of the Khedive’s Hareem in their miniature broughams
being foremost among the spectators.

The Moolid-en—Nebee ends with the performance of
the Doseh, when the Sheykh of the Saadeeyeh Dervishes
rides over a road of prostrate fanatics. L. and the Writer
witnessed this sight from the tent of the Governor of
Cairo. Drunk with Opium, fasting, and praying, rolling
their heads, and foaming at the mouth, some hundreds of
wretched creatures lay down in the road packed as close
as paving stones, and were walked and ridden over
before our eyes. The standard-bearers came ﬁrst; then
a priest reading the Koran aloud; then the Sheykh on
his white Arab, supported on either side by barefooted
priests. The beautiful horse trod with evident reluct-
ance, and as lightly and swiftly as possible, on the
human causeway under his hoofs. The Mohammedans
aver that no one is injured, or even bruised,1 on this holy

‘ “It is said that these persons, as well as the Sheykh, make use
of certain words (that is, repeat prayers and invocations) on the day
preceding this performance, to enable them to endure without injury
the tread of the horse ; and that some not thus prepared, having ven-
tured to lie down to be ridden over, have, on more than one occasion,
been either killed or severely injured. The performance is considered
as a miracle vouchsafed through supernatural power, and which has
been granted to every successive Sheykh of the Saadeeyeh.” See
Lane’s Modem Eypﬁam, chap. xxiv., p. 453. Lond., 1860.
