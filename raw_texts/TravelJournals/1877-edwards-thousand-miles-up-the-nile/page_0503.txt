dramatic. I sometimes took Salame, who smoked
cigarettes when not on active duty, or held a candle
while I sketched patterns of cornices, head-dresses of
Kings and Gods, designs of necklaces and bracelets,
heads of captives, and the like. Sometimes we explored
the side-chambers. Of these there are eight; pitch-dark,
and excavated at all kinds of angles. Two or three are
surrounded by stone benches cut in the rock; and in one
the hieroglyphic inscriptions are part cut, part sketched in
black and left unﬁnished. As this temple is entirely the
work of Rameses II., and betrays no sign of having been
added to by any of his successors, these evidences of
incompleteness would seem to show that the King died
before the work was ended.

I was always under the impression that there were
secret places yet undiscovered in these dark chambers,
and Salame and I were always looking for them.
At Denderah, at Edfoo, at Medinet Haboot, at Philae,1
there have been found crypts in the thickness of the
walls and recesses under the pavements, for the safe-
keeping of treasure in time of danger. The rock-cut
temples must also have had their hiding-places; and
these would doubtless take the form of concealed cells
in the walls, or under the ﬂoors, of the side-chambers.

' A rich treasure of gold and silver rings was found by Ferlini, in 1834,
immured in the wall of one of the pyramids of Meroe, in Upper Nubia.
