The walls of this most curious and interesting for-
tress have probably lost much of their original height.
They are in some parts 30 feet thick, and nowhere
less than 20. Vertical on the inside, they are built
at a buttress-slope outside, with additional shallow but-
tresses at regular distances. These last, as they can
scarcely add to the enormous strength of the original
wall, were probably designed for effect. There are two
entrances to the fortress; one in the centre of the north
wall, and one in the south. We enter the enclosure by
the last-named, and ﬁnd ourselves in the midst of an
immense parallelogram measuring about 450 feet from
east to west, and perhaps 300 feet from north to south.

they desired three days for consideration and did nothing which they
were bound to do, Petronius attacked and compelled them to ﬁght.
They soon ﬂed, being badly commanded and badly armed, for they
carried large shields made of raw hides, and hatchets for offensive
weapons. Part of the insurgents were driven into the city, others ﬂed
into the uninhabited country, and such as ventured upon the passage
of the river escaped to a neighbouring island, where there were not
many crocodiles, on account of the current. . . . Petronius then attacked
Pselcis, and took it.”

 

STRABo's Gmgrap/zy, Bohn’s translation, 1857,
vol. iii., pp. 267-8. This island to which the insurgents ﬂed may have
been the large sand island which here still occupies the middle of the
river, and obstructs the approach to Dakkeh. Or they may have ﬂed
to the island of Derar, seven miles higher up. Strabo does not'give
the name of the island.
