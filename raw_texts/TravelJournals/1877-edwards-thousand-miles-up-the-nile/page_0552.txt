As regards general conception, the Aboo Simbel monu-
ment comes under the same head with the contemporary
Temples of Derr, Gerf Hossayn, and Wady Sabooah;
being in a mixed style which combines excavation with
construction. This style seems to have been peculiarly
in favour during the reign of Rameses II.

Situated at the south—eastern angle of the rock, a
little way beyond the facade of the Great Temple, this
rock-cut adytum and hall of entrance face S.E. by E., and
command much the same view that is commanded
higher up by the Temple of Hathor. The adytum, or
excavated Speos, measures 21 feet 2% inches in breadth
by 14 feet 8 inches in length. The height from ﬂoor to
ceiling is about 12 feet. The doorway measures 4 feet
332 inches in width; and the outer recess for the door-
frame, 5 feet. Two large circular holes, one in the
threshold and the other in the lintel, mark the place of
the pivot on which the door once swung.

It is not very easy to measure the outer hall in its
present ruined and encumbered state; but as nearly as
we could judge, its dimensions are as follows :———Length
25 feet; width 22.},- feet; width of principal entrance
facing the Nile, 6 feet; width of two side entrances,
4 feet and 6 feet respectively; thickness of crude-brick
walls, 3 feet. Engaged in the brickwork on either side
of the principal entrance to this hall are two stone door-
jambs; and some six or eight feet in front of these,
