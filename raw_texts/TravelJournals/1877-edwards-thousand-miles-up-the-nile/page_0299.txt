And now, with that irrepressible instinct of rivalry
that ﬂesh—especially ﬂesh on the N ile—is heir to, we

quickly turn our good going into a trial of Speed. It
is no longer a mere business-like devotion to the matter
in hand. It is a contest for glory. It is the Phila
against the F ostat, and the Bagstones against both.
In plain English, it is a race. The two leading Daha-
beeyahs are pretty equally matched. The Philae is
larger than the Fostat; but the Fostat has a bigger
mainsail. On the other hand, the Fostat is an iron boat;
whereas the Philee, being wooden-built, is easier to pole
off a sandbank, and lighter in hand. The Bagstones
carries a capital mainsail, and can go as fast as either
upon occasion. Meanwhile the race is one of perpetually
varying fortunes. N ow the Fostat shoots ahead; now
the Philae. We pass and re-pass; take the wind out of
one another’s sails; economise every curve; hoist every
stitch of canvas ; and, having identiﬁed ourselves with our
boats, are as eager to win as if a great prize depended on
it. Under these circumstances, to dine is difﬁcult—to
go to bed superﬂuous—to sleep impossible. As to
'mooring for the night, it is not to be thought of for a
moment. Having begun the contest, we can no more
help going than the wind can help blowing; and our
crew are as keen about winning as ourselves.

As night advances, the wind continues to rise, and
our excitement with it. Still the boats chase each other
