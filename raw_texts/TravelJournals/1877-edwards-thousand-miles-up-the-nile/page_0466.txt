during the early years of his reign, and have afterwards
abandoned it in favour of the most gorgeous mortuary
temple the world has ever seen. Future excavations in
the area of the Ramesseum, or the contents of some yet
undiscovered papyrus, may hereafter solve this question.

Such are, very briefly, the leading facts of the history
of this famous Pharaoh. Exhaustively treated, they
would expand into a volume. Even then, however, one
