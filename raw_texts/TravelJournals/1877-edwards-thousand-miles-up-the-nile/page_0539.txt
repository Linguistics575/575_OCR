And now, more than ever, we felt the need of
implements. With a spade or two and a wheelbarrow,
we could have done wonders; but with only one small
ﬁre-shovel, a birch broom, a couple of charcoal baskets,
and about twenty pairs of hands, we were poor indeed.
What was wanted in means, however, was made up in
method. Some scraped away the sand; some gathered
it into baskets; some carried the baskets to the edge of
the cliff, and emptied them into the river. The Idle
Man distinguished himself by scooping out a channel
where the slope was steepest; which greatly facilitated
the work. Emptied down this shoot and kept continu-
ally going, the sand poured off in a steady stream like
water.

Meanwhile the opening grew rapidly larger. When
we ﬁrst came up—that is, when the Painter and the two
sailors had been working on it for about an hour—we
found a hole scarcely as large as one’s hand, through
which it was just possible to catch a dim glimpse of
painted walls within. By sunset, the top of the doorway
was laid bare, and where the crack ended in a large
triangular fracture, there was an aperture about a foot
and a half square, into which Mehemet Ali was the ﬁrst
to squeeze his way. We passed him in a candle and a
box of matches; but he came out again directly, saying
that it was a most beautiful Bz'rée/z, and quite light

within.
