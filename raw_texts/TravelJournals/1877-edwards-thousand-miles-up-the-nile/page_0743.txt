remained till dinner was announced. We were next
ushered through an anteroom where two turbaned and
barefooted servants were in waiting; the one with a
brass basin and ewer, the other with an armful of Turkish
towels. We then, each in turn, held our hands over the
basin; had water poured on them ; and received a towel
apiece. These towels we were told to keep; and they
served for dinner-napkins. The anteroom opened into
a brilliantly-lighted dining-room of moderate size, hav-
ing in the centre a round brass table with an upright
ﬂuted rim, like a big tray. For each person were placed
a chair, a huge block of bread, a wooden spoon, two
tumblers, and a bouquet. Plates, knives, forks, there
were none.

The party consisted of the Happy Couple, the Director
of the Luxor Telegraph Ofﬁce, L., the Writer, young
Ahmed, and our host.

“ To-night we are all Arabs,” said Mustapha Aga, as
he showed us where to sit. “ We drink Nile water,
and we eat with our ﬁngers.”

So we drank Nile water; and for the ﬁrst time in
our lives we ate with our ﬁngers. In fact, we found
them exceedingly useful.

The dinner was excellent. Without disrespect to
our own accomplished chef, or to the accomplished chefs
of our various friends upon the river, I am bound to say
that it was the very best dinner I ever ate out of Europe.
