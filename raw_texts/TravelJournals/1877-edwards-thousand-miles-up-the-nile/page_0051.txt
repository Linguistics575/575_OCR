and were back in time for dinner at half-past six. But
it must be understood that we did not go to see the
Pyramids. We went only to look at them. Later on
(having meanwhile been up the Nile and back, and gone
through months of training), we came again, not only
with due leisure, but also with some practical understand-
ing of the manifold phases through which the arts and
architecture of Egypt had passed since those far-off days
of Cheops and Chephren. Then, only, we can be said to
have seen the Pyramids; and till we arrive at that stage
of our pilgrimage it will be well to defer everything like
a detailed account of them or their surroundings. Of
this ﬁrst brief visit, enough therefore a brief record.

The ﬁrst glimpse that most travellers now get of the
Pyramids is from the window of the railway carriage
as they come from Alexandria; and it is not impressive.
It does not take one's breath away, for instance, like a
ﬁrst sight of the Alps from the high level of the Neufchatel
line, or the outline of the Acropolis at Athens as one ﬁrst
recognises it from the sea. The well-known triangular
forms look small and shadowy, and are too familiar to be
in any way startling. And the same, I think, is true of
every distant view of them,———that is. of every view which
is too distant to afford the means of scaling them against
other objects. It is only in approaching them and
observing how they grow with every foot of the road,
that one begins to feel they are not so familiar after all.
