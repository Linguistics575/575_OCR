under the sands of the necropolis of Sakkarah. One
day, however, (in 18 50) being attracted to Sakkarah
by my Egyptological studies, I perceived the head
of a sphinx showing above the surface. It evidently
occupied its original position. Close by lay a libation-
table on which was engraved a hieroglyphic inscription
to Apis-Osiris. Then that passage in Strabo came to
my memory, and I knew that beneath my feet lay the
avenue leading to the long and vainly sought Serapeum.
Without saying a word to any one, I got some workmen
together and we began excavating. The beginning was
difﬁcult ; but soon the lions, the peacocks, the Greek
statues of the Dromos, the inscribed tablets of the
Temple of N ectaneboll rose up from the sands. Thus
was the Serapeum discovered.”

The house—a slight, one-storied building on a space
of rocky platform—looks down upon a sandy hollow which
now presents much the same appearance that it must
have presented when M. Mariette was ﬁrst reminded of
the fortunate passage in Strabo. One or two heads of
sphinxes peep-up here and there in a ghastly way above
the sand, and mark the line of the great avenue. The
upper half of a boy riding on a peacock, apparently of
rude execution, is also visible. The rest is already as

‘ Nectanebo I. and Nectanebo II. were the last native 'Pharaohs of

ancient Egypt, and ﬂourished between B.C. 378 and B.C. 340. An earlier
Temple must have preceded the Serapeum built by Nectanebo I.
