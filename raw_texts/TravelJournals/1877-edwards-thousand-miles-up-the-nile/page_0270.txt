the use of the blow-pipe, ever made glass in sheets, or
introduced it in this way into their buildings.

How often has it been written, and how often must it
be repeated, that the Great Hall at Karnak is the
noblest architectural work ever designed and executed
by human hands ? One writer tells us that it covers four
times the area occupied by the Cathedral of N otre Dame
in Paris. Another measures it against St. Peter’s. All
admit their inability to describe it; yet all attempt the
description.‘ To convey a concrete image of the place to
one who has not seen it, is however, as I have already said,
impossible. If it could be likened to this place or that,
the task would not be so difﬁcult; but there is, in truth,
no building in the wide world to compare with it. The
Pyramids are more stupendous. The Colosseum covers
more ground. The Parthenon is more beautiful. Yet
in nobility of conception, in vastness of detail, in majestic
beauty of the highest order, the Hall of Pillars exceeds
them every one. This doorway, these columns, are the
wonder of the world. How was that lintel-stone raised ?
How were those capitals lifted ? Entering among those
mighty pillars, says a recent observer, “you feel that you
have shrunk to the dimensions and feebleness of a ﬂy.”
But I think you feel more than that. You are stupiﬁed
by the thought of the mighty men who made them. You
say to yourself :-—-“ There were indeed giants in those
days.”
