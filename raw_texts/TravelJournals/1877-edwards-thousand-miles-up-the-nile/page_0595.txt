We are beset here by an insolent crowd of savage-
looking men and boys, and impudent girls with long
frizzy hair and Nubian fringes, who pester us with beads
and pebbles; dance, shout, slap their legs and clap their
hands in our faces; and pelt us when we go away. One
ragged warrior brandishes an antique brass-mounted
ﬁrelock full six feet long in the barrel, and some of the
others carry slender spears.

The Temple—a late Roman structure—would seem
to have been wrecked by earthquake before it was com-
pleted. The masonry is all in the rough—pillars as
they came from the quarry ; capitals blocked out,
waiting for the carver. These unﬁnished ruins—of which
every stone looks new, as if the work was still in pro-
gress—affect one’s imagination strangely. On a fallen
wall South of the portico, the Idle Man detected some
remains of a Greek inscription ;1 but for hieroglyphic

’ Of this wall, Burckhardt notices that “it has fallen down, appa-
rently from some sudden and violent concussion, as the stones are
lying on the ground in layers, as when placed in the wall; a proof
that they must have fallen all at once.”——Travels in Nuéia: Ed. 1819,
p. 100. But he has not observed the inscription, which is in large
characters, and consists of three lines on three separate layers of stones.
The Idle Man c0pied the original upon the spot, which copy has since
been identiﬁed with an ex—voto of a Roman soldier published in Boeckh’s
Corpus 1mm Gram, of which the following is a translation :—

“ The vow of Verecundus the soldier, and his most pious parents,
and Gaius his little brother, and the rest of his brethren.”
