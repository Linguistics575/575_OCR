years before by Amenhotep III. He built also the
courtyard upon which this pylon opened, joining it to the
older part of the building in such wise that the original
ﬁrst court became now the second court, while next in
order came the portico, the hall of assembly, and the
sanctuary. By and by, when the long line of Rameses
had passed away, other and later kings put their hands
to the work. The names of Sabaco, of Ptolemy Philo-
pater, and of Alexander the Younger, appear among the '
later inscriptions; while those of Amenhotep IV. (Khoo-
en-Aten), Horus, and Seti, the father of Rameses the
Great, are found in the earlier parts of the building. It
was in this way that an Egyptian temple grew from age
to age, owing a colonnade to this King and a pylon to
that, till it came in time to represent the styles of many
periods. Hence, too, that frequent irregularity of plan
which, unless it could be ascribed to the caprices of
successive builders, would form so unaccountable a
feature in Egyptian architecture. In the present
instance, the pylon and courtyard of Rameses II. are set
at an angle of ﬁve degrees to the courtyard and sanctuary
of Amenhotep III. This has evidently been done to
bring the temple of Luxor into a line with the temple of
Karnak, in order that the two might be connected by
means of that stupendous avenue of sphinxes, the
scattered remains of which yet strew the course of the

ancient roadway.
