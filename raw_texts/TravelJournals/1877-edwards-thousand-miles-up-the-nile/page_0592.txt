and undulating than were ever modelled by Canaletti’s
pencﬂ.

Supposing yonder town to have been founded in the
days when the river was a river, and the plain fertile and
well watered, the mystery of its position is explained.
It was protected in front by the Nile, and in the rear by
the ravine and the river. But how long ago was this?
Here apparently was an independent stream, taking its
rise among the Libyan mountains. It dated back, con-
sequently, to a time when those barren hills collected
and distributed water—that is to say, to a time when it
used to rain in Nubia. And that time must have been
before the rocky barrier broke down at Silsilis, in the old
days when the land of Cush ﬂowed with milk and honey.1

It would rain even now in Nubia, if it could. That
same evening when the sun was setting, we saw a fan-
like drift of dappled cloud miles high above our heads,
melting, as it seemed, in fringes of iridescent vapour.
We could distinctly see those fringes forming, wavering,
and evaporating; unable to descend as rain, because
dispersed at a high altitude by radiated heat from the
desert. This, with one exception, was the only occasion
on which I saw clouds in Nubia.

1Not only near this nameless town, but in many other parts
between Aboo Simbel and Philm, we found the old alluvial soil lying
as high as from 20 to 30 feet above the level of the present in-
undations.
