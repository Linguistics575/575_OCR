the Nile in two branches, each-of which looks as wide as
the whole river. An unbounded distance opens away to
the silvery horizon. On the banks there is no verdure;
neither is there any sign of human toil. Nothing lives,
nothing moves, save the wind and the river.

Of all the strange peaks we have yet seen, the moun-
tains hereabout are the strangest. Alone or in groups,
they start up here and there from the deserts on both
sides, like the pieces on a chess-board.‘ They are for
the most part conical; but they are not extinct craters,
such as are the volcanic cones of Korosko and Dakkeh.
Seeing how they all rose to about the same height, and
were alike capped with that mysterious tout/w of shining
black stones, the Writer could not help fancying that,

him a habitation of many ages." We know nothing of the Rock of
Ha’m (rendered'Sciam by Rosellini), but it should no doubt be sought
somewhere between Aboo Simbel and Wady Halfeh. “ Qua] sito pre-
cisamente dinotisi in questo nome di Sciam, io non saprei nel presente
stato delle cose determinate : credo peraltro secondo varie luoghi delle
iscrizioni che lo ricordano, che fosse situato sull’ una o l’altra sponda
del N ilo, nel paese compreso tra Wadi-halfa e Ibsambul, o poco oltre.
E qui dovrebbe trovarsi i1 nominato speco di Horus, ﬁno a1 presente
occulto a noi.”—ROSELLINI, Letterpress to Monummtz’ Slorz'a', vol. iii.,
part ii. p. 184. It would hence appear that the Rock of Ha’m is men-
tioned in other inscriptions.

The distance between Aboo Simbel and Wady Halfeh is only forty
miles, and the likely places along the banks are but few. Would not
the discovery of this lost Temple be an enterprise worthier the ambition
of tourists, than the extermination of such few crocodiles as yet linger
north of the Second Cataract?
