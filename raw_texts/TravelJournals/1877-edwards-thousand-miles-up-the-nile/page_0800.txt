and sharp amid the palpitating blaze of noon, stands,
like an unﬁnished tower of Babel, the Pyramid of
Meydoom. It is in this direction that our eyes turn
oftenest—to the measureless desert in its mystery of
light and silence; to the Nile where it gleams out again
and again, till it melts at last into that faint far distance

beyond which lie Thebes, and Philm, and Aboo Simbel.
