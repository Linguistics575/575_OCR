he was delighted. He showed his teeth; he rolled his
eyes; he uttered the long-drawn “ Ah ! ” which in Egypt
signiﬁes applause. The more crabbed, the more far-
fetched, the more unintelligible the movement, the
better, apparently, he liked it.

I never think of Assouan but I remember that
curious scene—our Little Lady at the piano; the black
Governor grinning in ecstasies close by; the Kadee in
his magniﬁcent shawl—turban; the Mudeer half-asleep;
the air thick with tobacco-smoke; and above all—
dominant, tyrannous, overpowering—the crash and
clang, the involved harmonies, and the multitudinous
combinations of Tannhauser.

The linked sweetness of an Oriental visit is generally
drawn out to a length that sorely tries the patience and
politeness of European hosts. A native gentleman, if he
has any business to attend to, gets through his work
before noon, and has nothing to do but smoke, chat, and
doze away the remainder of the day. For time, which
hangs heavily on his hands, he has absolutely no value.
His main object in life is to consume it, if possible, less
tediously. He pays a visit, therefore, with the deliberate
intention of staying as long as possible. Our guests on
the present occasion remained the best part of two
hours; and the Governor, who talked of going to
England shortly, asked for all our names and addresses,
that he might come and see us at home.
