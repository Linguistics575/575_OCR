straggled in from without, now stumbling along by the
light of a bunch of candles tied to the end of a stick,
we preferred to receive those ﬁrst impressions of vast-
ness, of mystery, of gloomy magniﬁcence, which are the
more profound for being somewhat vague and general.
Scenes of war, of triumph, of worship, passed before
our eyes like the incidents of a panorama. Here the
King, borne along at full gallop by plumed steeds gor-
geously caparisoned, draws his mighty bow and attacks
a battlemented fortress. The besieged, some of whom
are transﬁxed by his tremendous arrows, supplicate for
mercy. They are a Syrian people, and are by some
identiﬁed with the Northern Hittites. Their skin is
yellow; and they wear the long hair and beard, the ﬁllet,
.the rich robe, fringed cape, and embroidered baldric
with which we are familiar in the Nineveh sculptures.
A man driving off cattle in the foreground looks as if
he had stepped out of one of the tablets in the British
Museum. Rameses meanwhile towers, swift and godlike,
above the crowd. His coursers are of such immortal
strain as were the coursers of Achilles. His sons, his
whole army, chariot and horse, follow headlong at his
heels. All is movement and the splendour of battle.
Farther on, we see the King returning in state,
preceded by his prisoners of war. Tied together in
gangs. they stagger as they go, with heads thrown back
and hands uplifted. These, however, are not Assyrians.
