Khan and a noble old sycamore, form a picturesque group
backed by amber sand—cliffs, and mark the site of a lost
city 1 belonging to the early days of Usurtasen III.

The Second, or Great Cataract, begins a little way
aboVe Wady Halfeh and extends over a distance of
many miles. It consists, like the First Cataract, of a
succession of rocks and rapids, and is skirted for the ﬁrst
ﬁve miles or so by the sand-cliff ridge which, as I have
said, forms a background to the ruins just opposite
Wady Halfeh. This ridge terminates abruptly in the
famous precipice known as the Rock of Abooseer.
Only adventurous travellers bound for Dongola or
Khartoom go beyond this point; and they, for the most
part, take the shorter route across the desert from
Korosko. L. and the Writer would fain have hired
camels and pushed on as far as Semneh; which is a
matter of only two days’ journey from Wady Halfeh,
and, for pe0ple provided with sketching tents, is one of
the easiest of inland excursions.

One may go to the Rock of Abooseer by land or by
water. The Happy Couple and the Writer took two
native boatmen versed in the intricacies of the Cataract;

' “Un Second Temple, plus grand, mais tout aussi détruit que le
précédent, existe un peu plus an sud, c’e’tait le grand temple de la ville
Egyptienne de Bé/lc’m', qui exista sur cet emplacement, et qui d’aprés
l’étendu des débris de poteries répandus sur la plaine aujourdhui

déserte, parait avoir été assez grande.”——Champollion, Leltrcs c’a'itc:
d’Egypte, etc., ed. 1868 ; Letter ix.
