picturesque. There is not much to see, and yet one
never wants for amusement. Now we pass an island of
sand-bank covered with snow-white paddy-birds, which
rise tumultuously at our approach. Next comes Bibbeh
perched high along the edge of the precipitous bank, its
odd-looking C0ptic Convent roofed all over with little
mud domes, like a cluster of earth-bubbles. By and by
we pass a deserted sugar-factory, with shattered windows
and a huge, gaunt, blackened chimney, worthy of
Birmingham or Shefﬁeld. And now we catch a glimpse
of the railway, and hear the last scream of a departing
engine. At night we moor within sight of the
factory chimneys and hydraulic tubes of Magagha, and
next day get on nearly to Golosaneh, which is the last
station-town before Minieh.

It is now only too clear that we must give up all
thought of pushing on to Beni-Hassan before the rest of
the party come on board. We have reached the evening
of our ninth day; we are still forty-eight miles from
Rhoda; and another adverse wind might again delay us
indeﬁnitely on the way. All risks taken into account,
we decide to put off our meeting till the twenty-fourth,
and transfer the appointment to Minieh; thus giving
ourselves time to track all the way in case of need. 80
an Arabic telegram is concocted, and our ﬂeetest runner
sent off with it to Golosaneh before the ofﬁce closes for
the night.
