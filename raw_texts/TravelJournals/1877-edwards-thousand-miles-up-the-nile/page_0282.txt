chemist said it was “ kureiyib,” which means “ near by.”
A camel-driver pointed to a dilapidated wooden gateway
in a recess between two neighbouring houses. A small
boy volunteered to lead the way. We were greatly
puzzled. We had expected to see the Temple towering
above the surrounding houses, as at Luxor, and could
by no means understand how any large building to which
that gateway might give access, should not be visible
from without.

The boy, however, ran and thumped upon the gate,
and shouted “ Abbas! Abbas!” and Mehemet Ali, who
was doing escort, added some thundering blows with his
staff; and a little crowd gathered ; but no Abbas came.

The bystanders, as usual, were liberal with their
advice; recommending the boy to climb over, and the ‘
sailor to knock louder, and suggesting that Abbas the
absent might possibly be found in a certain neighbouring
café. At length I somewhat impatiently expressed my
Opinion that there was “ Mafeesh Birbeh ” (no Temple at
all); whereupon a dozen voices were raised to assure me
that the Birbeh was no myth—that it was “ kebeer ”
(big)——that it was “ kwy-ees ” (beautiful)-—and that all
the “ Ingleez ” came to see it.

‘In the midst of the clamour, however, and just as we
are about to turn away in despair, the gate creaks open ;
the gentlemen of the F ostat troop out in puggeries and
knickerbockers; and we are at last admitted.
