Some of the women who followed our friends to the
boat, though in complexion as black as the rest, had
light blue eyes and frizzy red hair, the effect of which
was indescribably frightful. Both here and at Ibrim
there are many of these “fair ” families, who claim to
be descended from Bosnian fathers stationed in Nubia
at the time of the conquest of Sultan Selim in A.D. I 517.
They are immensely proud of their alien blood, and
think themselves quite beautiful.

All hands being safe on board, we pushed off at
once, leaving about a couple of hundred disconsolate
dealers on the bank. A long-drawn howl of disappoint-
ment followed in our wake. Those who had sold,
and those who had not sold, were alike wronged, ruined,
and betrayed. One woman tore wildly along the bank,
shrieking and beating her breast. Foremost among
the sellers, she had parted from her gold brow-pendant
for a good price; but was inconsolable now for the
loss of it.

It often happened that those who had been most
eager to trade, were readiest to repent of their bargains.
Even so, however, their cupidity outweighed their love
of ﬁnery. Moved once or twice by the lamentations
of some dark damsel who had sold her necklace at a
handsome proﬁt, we offered to annul the purchase.

But it invariably proved that, despite her tears, she

preferred to keep the money.
