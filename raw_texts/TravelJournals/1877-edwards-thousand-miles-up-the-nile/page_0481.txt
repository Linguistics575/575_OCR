Egyptians invariably prepared their surfaces for painting.
Perhaps the architects were for once content with the
natural colour of the sandstone, which is here very rich
and varied. It happens also that the colossi come in a
light-coloured vein of the rock, and so sit relieved
against a darker background. Towards noon, when the
level of the facade has just passed into shade and the
sunlight still strikes upon the statues, the effect is quite
startling. The whole thing, which is then best seen
from the island, looks like a huge onyx-cameo cut in
high relief.

A statue of Ra,1 to whom the temple is dedicated,
stands some twenty feet high in a niche over the door-
way, and is supported on either side by a bas-relief
portrait of the king in an attitude of worship. Next
above these comes a superb hieroglyphic inscription
reaching across the whole front; above the inscription, a
band of royal cartouches; above the cartouches, a frieze

' Ra, a solar divinity, generally represented with the head of a
hawk, and the sun-disk on his head. “Ra veut dire faz're, dz'sposcr;
c’est, en effet, 1e dieu Ra qui a disposé, organisé le monde, dont la
matiere lui a été donnée par Ptah."— P. PIERRET: Dz'ctzbnnaire
d’A rc/Iéologz'e Egyﬂkmm

“Ra est une autre des intelligences démiurgiques. Ptah avait
créé le soleil ; le soleil, a son tour, est [a créateur dc: fires, am'maux ct
hammer. Il est a l’hémisphére supérieure ce qu’Osiris est a l’hémisphére
inférieure. Ra s’incarne a Héliopolis.”———A. MARIET’I‘E: Notice dc:
Monument: d Boulak, p. 123.
