and Bayt-el-Welly, his features (though bearing in some
instances the impress of youth, and in others of
maturity) are always the same. The face is oval; the
eyes are long, prominent, and heavy-lidded; the nose is
slightly aquiline and characteristically depressed at the
tip; the nostrils are open and sensitive; the under lip
projects; the chin is short and square.

Here, for instance, is an outline from
a bas-relief at Bayt-el-Welly. The subject
is commemorative of the king’s ﬁrst cam-

rage of battle, he clutches a captive by the

 

hair and lifts his mace to slay. In this
delicate and Dantesque face which lacks as yet the
fulness and repose of the later portraits, we recognise
all the distinctive traits of the older Rameses.

Here, again, is a sketch from Aby-
dos, in which the king, although he has
not yet ceased to wear the side-lock
of youth, is seen with a
boyish beard, and looks
some three or four years older than in the
