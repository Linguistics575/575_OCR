scene of Our Lord’s childhood in the midst of this
beautiful and glowing Egyptian pastoral. With what a
profound and touching interest it would invest the place!
With what different eyes we should look down upon a
landscape which must have been dear and familiar to
Him in all its details, and which, from the nature of the
ground, must have remained almost unchanged from
His day to ours! The mountain with its tombs, the
green corn-ﬂats, the Nile and the desert, looked then as
they look now. It is only the Moslem minarets that are
new. It is only the pylons and sanctuaries of the
ancient worship that have passed away.
