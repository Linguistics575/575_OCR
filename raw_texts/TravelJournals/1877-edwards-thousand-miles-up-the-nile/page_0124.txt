The most difﬁcult and transitory movements are ex-
pressed with masterly certitude. The donkey kicks up his
heels and brays—the crocodile plunges—the wild duck
rises on the wing; and the ﬂeeting action is caught in
each instance with a truthfulness that no Landseer could
distance. The forms, which have none of the conven-
tional stiffness of later Egyptian work, are modelled
roundly and boldly, yet ﬁnished with exquisite precision
and delicacy. The colouring, however, is purely deco-
rative; and being laid on in single tints, with no attempt
at gradation or shading, conceals rather than enhances
the beauty of the sculptures. These, indeed, are best
seen where the colour is entirely rubbed off. The tints
are yet quite brilliant in parts of the larger chamber;
but in the passage and courtyard, which have been
excavated only a few years and are with difﬁculty kept
clear from day to day, there is not a vestige of colour
left. This is the work of the sand—that patient labourer
whose ofﬁce it is not only to preserve but to destroy.
The sand secretes the work of the sculptor, but effaces
the work of the painter. In sheltered places where it
accumulates passively like a snow-drift, it brings away
only the surface—detail, leaving the under colours rubbed
and dim. But nothing, as I had occasion constantly to
remark in the course of the journey, removes colour so
effectually as sand that is exposed to the shifting action
of the wind.
