Re'l's Hassan, honest Khaleefeh, laughing Salame, gentle
Mehemet Ali, and Moosa “ black but comely ”—they were
all there. What a shaking of hands there was—what a
gleaming of white teeth—what a shower of mutually
unintelligible congratulations! For my own part, I may
say with truth that I was never much more rejoiced at a
meeting in my life.
