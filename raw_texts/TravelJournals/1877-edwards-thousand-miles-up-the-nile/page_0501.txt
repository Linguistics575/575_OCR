of sunlight can doubt that it was a calculated effect, and
that the excavation was directed at one especial angle in
order to produce it. In this way Ra,1 to whom the
temple was dedicated, may be said to have entered in
daily, and by a direct manifestation of his presence to
have approved the sacriﬁces of his worshippers.

I need scarcely say that we did not see half the wall-
sculptures or even half the chambers, that ﬁrst after-
noon at Aboo Simbel. We rambled to and fro, lost in
wonder, and content to wonder, like rustics at a fair.
We had, however, ample time to come again and again,
and learn it all by heart. The Writer went in con—
stantly, and at all hours; but most frequently at the end
of the day’s sketching, when the rest were walking or
boating in the cool of the late afternoon.

It is a wonderful place to be alone in—a place in
which the very darkness and silence are old, and in
which Time himself seems to have fallen asleep. Wan-
dering to and fro among these sculptured halls, like a
shade among shadows, one seems to have left the world

‘ Ra, ou quelquefois Horus. C’est le dieu solaire par excellence.”
—A. MARIE'I'I‘E. Aron}: dry 111072211126er: d Boulak, p. I 23. See also
footnote at p. 425. It will be seen by the above that M. Mariette,
who certainly knows more than any one in the world about the Egyptian
Pantheon, admits that Ra and Horus are identical. This is important,
and shows that the work of simpliﬁcation foreseen by Ampere is now

begun in earnest. The day is, perhaps, approaching when Khons will
also be recognised as a form of Ra, Hathor as a version of Isis, etc. etc.
