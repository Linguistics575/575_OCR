the Algerine shops in London almost as cheaply as in
Cairo. Another majestic Pasha deals in brass and copper
vessels, drinking-cups, basins, ewers, trays, incense-
burners, chaﬁng—dishes, and the like; some of which are
exquisitely engraved with Arabesque patterns or sen-
tences from the poets. A third sells silks from the
looms of Lebanon, and gold and silver tissues from
Damascus. Others, again, sell old arms, old porcelain,
old embroideries, second-hand prayer-carpets, and quaint
little stools and cabinets of ebony inlaid with mother-of-
pearl. Here, too, the tobacco-merchant sits behind a
huge cake of Latakia as big as his own body; and the
sponge-merchant smokes his long chibouk in a bower of
sponges.

Most amusing of all, however, are those bazaars in
which each trade occupies its separate quarter. You
pass through an old stone gateway or down a narrow
turning, and ﬁnd yourself amid a colony of saddlers
stitching, hammering, punching, riveting. You walk up
one alley and down another, between shop-fronts hung
round with tasselled head-gear and humpbacked saddles
of all qualities and colours. Here are Iadies’ saddles,
military saddles, donkey-saddles, and saddles for great
ofﬁcers of state; saddles covered with red leather, with
crimson and violet velvet, with maroon, and grey, and
purple cloth; saddles embroidered with gold and silver,
studded with brass-headed nails, or trimmed with braid.
