In such wise, and in such a temperature, we found
ourselves becalmed one morning within six miles of
Denderah. Not even L. could be induced to take a six-
mile donkey-ride that day in the sun. The Writer,
however, ordered out her sketching-tent and paid a last
visit to the Temple; which, seen amid the ripening
splendour of miles of barley, looked gloomier, and
grander, and more solitary than ever.

Two or three days later, we came within reach of
Abydus. Our prOper course would have been to push
on to Bellianeh, which is one of the recognised starting-
points for Abydus. But an unluckly sandbank barred
the way; so we moored instead at Samata, a village
about two miles nearer to the southward. Here our
dragoman requisitioned the inhabitants for donkeys. As
it happened, the harvest had begun in the neighbour-
hood and all the beasts of burden were at work, so that
it was near midday before we succeeded in getting
together the three or four wretched little brutes with
which we ﬁnally started. Not one of these steeds had
ever before carried a rider. We had a frightful time
with them. My donkey bolted about every ﬁve
minutes. L.’s snarled like a camel and showed its teeth
like a dog. The Idle Man’s, bent on ﬂattening its
rider, lay down and rolled at short intervals. In this
exciting fashion, we somehow or another accomplished
the seven miles that separate Samata from Abydus.
