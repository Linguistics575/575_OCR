Coming back, we met a solitary native, with a string
of beads in his hand and a knife up his sleeve. He
followed us for a long way, volunteering a but half-
intelligible story about some unknown Birbeh1 in the
desert. We asked where it was, and he pointed up the
course of our unknown river.

“ You have seen it P” said the Painter.

“ Marrat keteer ” (many times).

“‘ How far is it P”

“One day’s march in the hagger” (desert).

“ And have no Ingleezeh ever been to look for it?”

He shook his head at ﬁrst, not understanding the
question ; then looked grave and held up one ﬁnger.

Our stock of Arabic was so small, and his so inter-
larded with Kensee, that we had great difﬁculty in
making out what he said next. We gathered, however,
that some Howadji, travelling alone and on foot, had
once gone in search of this Birbeh, and never come
back. Was he lost? Was he killed P—Who could say ?

“It was a long time ago,” said the man with the
beads. “It was a long time ago, and he took no guide
with him.”

We would have given much to trace the river to its
source, and search for this unknown Temple in the
desert. But it is one of the misfortunes of this kind of

1 Ar. Birbeh, Temple.
