lies across a desolate open space littered with debris, but
destined to be laid out as a public square. With this
desirable end in view some half-dozen workmen were
lazily loading as many camels with rubble, which is the
Arab way of carting rubbish. If they persevere, and the
Minister of Public Works continues to pay their wages
with due punctuality, the ground will perhaps get cleared
in eight or ten years’ time.

Driving up with some difﬁculty to the foot of the
great steps, which were crowded with idlers smoking and

main wall of the building, close against the minaret. It
looked just such a rent as might be caused by a shock of
earthquake, and, being still new to the East, we wondered
the government had not set to work to mend it. We had
yet to learn that nothing is ever mended in Cairo. Here,
as in Constantinople, new buildings spring up space, but
the old, no matter how venerable, are allowed to moulder
away, inch by inch, till nothing remains but a heap of
ruins.

Going up the steps and through a lofty hall, up some
more steps and along a gloomy corridor, we came to the
great court, before entering which, however, we had to
take off our boots and put on slippers brought for the
purpose. The ﬁrst sight of this court is an architectural
surprise. It is like nothing one has ever seen before,
