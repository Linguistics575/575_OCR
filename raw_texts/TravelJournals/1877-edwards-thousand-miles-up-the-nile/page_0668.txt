surface. They waylaid‘and followed us wherever we
went; while some of the better sort—grave men in long
black robes and ample turbans—installed themselves on
our lower deck, and lived there for a fortnight. Go
upstairs when one would, whether before breakfast in
the morning, or after dinner in the evening, there we
always found them; patient; imperturbable; ready to rise
up, and salaam, and produce from some hidden pocket a
purseful of scarabs or a bundle of votive statuettes.
Some of these gentlemen were Arabs, some COpts—all
polite, plausible, and mendacious.

Where Copt and Arab drive the same doubtful trade,
it is not easy to deﬁne the shades of difference in their
dealings. As workmen, the Copts are perhaps the most
artistic. As salesmen, the Arabs are perhaps the less
dishonest. Both sell more forgeries than genuine
antiquities. Be the demand what it may, they are
prepared to meet it. Thothmes is not too heavy, nor
Cleopatra too light, for them. Their carvings in old
sycamore wood, their porcelain statuettes, their hiero-
glyphed limestone tablets, are executed with a skill that
almost deﬁes detection. As for genuine scarabs of the
highest antiquity, they are turned out by the gross every
season. Engraved, glazed, and administered to the
turkeys in the form of boluses, they acquire by the
simple process of digestion a degree of venerableness

that is really charming.
