shako; and some of the men wear disk-shaped amulets
pierced with a hole in the centre, through which is
passed the chain that suspends it round the neck.
Leaving to the left a ﬁne sitting statue of Khons in
green basalt, and to the right his prostrate fellow, we
pass under the gateway, cross a space of desolate crude—
brick mounds, and see before us the ruins of the ﬁrst
pylon of the Great Temple of Khem. Once past the
threshold of this pylon, we enter upon a succession of
magniﬁcent courtyards. The hieroglyphs here are on a
colossal scale, and are cut deeper than any others in
Egypt. They are also coloured with a more subtle eye
to effect. Struck by the unusual splendour of some of
the blues, and by a peculiar look of scintillation which
they assumed in certain lights, I examined them par-
ticularly, and found that the effect had been produced by
very subtle shades of gradation in what appeared at ﬁrst

sight to be simple ﬂat tints. In some of the reeds ($),

for instance, the ground-colour begins at the top of the
leaf in pure cobalt, and passes imperceptibly down to a
tint that is almost emerald green at the bottom.1

' The grand blue of the ceiling of the colonnade of the Great
Hypaethral Court is also very remarkable for brilliancy and purity of
tone ; while to those interested in decoration the capital and abacus of
the second column to the right on entering this courtyard, offers an
interesting specimen of polychrome ornamentation on a gold-coloured
ground.
