peOple years and years ago—“perhaps in some previous
stage of existence; that I had walked with them in their
gardens; listened to the music of their lutes and tam-
bourines; pledged them at their feasts. Here is the
funeral procession that I know so well; and the trial
scene after death, where the mummy stands upright in
the presence of Osiris, and sees his heart weighed in the
balance. Here is that well—remembered old fowler
crouching in the rushes with his basket of decoys. One
withered hand is lifted to his mouth; his lips frame the
call; his thin hair blows in the breeze. I see now that
he has placed himself to the leeward of the game; but
that subtlety escaped me in the reading days of my youth.
Yonder I recognise a sculptor's studio into which I
frequently peeped at that time. His men are at work as
actively as ever; but I marvel that they have not yet
ﬁnished polishing the surface of that red-granite colossus.
This patient angler, still waiting for a bite, is another old
acquaintance; and yonder, I declare, is that evening
party at which I was so often an imaginary guest! Is
the feast not yet over? Has that late comer whom we
saw hurrying along just now in a neighbouring corridor
not yet arrived? Will the musicians never play to the
end of their concerto? Are those ladies still so deeply
interested in the patterns of one another’s ear-rings?
It seems to me that the world has been standing still in
here for these last ﬁve-and-thirty years.
