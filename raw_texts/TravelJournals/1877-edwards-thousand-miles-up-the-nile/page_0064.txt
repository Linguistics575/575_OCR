not be possible to reconstruct from them some of those
lost hieroglyphic legends that once covered the entire
surface of the Great Pyramid? The builders of the
mosque would scarcely have wasted labour on effacing
that ancient writing which no man could then understand.
They would naturally have been content to imbed that
side of each stone in the thickness of the walls; and
there, no doubt, pages of precious history—the history
of the dynasties before Chephren—lie buried.

From the mosque of this Memlook sovereign it is
but a few minutes’ uphill drive to the mosque of Mehemet
Ali, by whose orders the last of that royal race were
massacred just sixty—four years ago. This mosque,
built within the precincts of the citadel on a spur of
the Mokattam Hills overlooking the city, is the most
conspicuous object in Cairo. Its attenuated minarets
and clustered domes show from every point of view for
miles around, and remain longer in sight, as one leaves
or returns to Cairo, than any other landmark. It is a
spacious, costly, gaudy, commonplace building, with
nothing really beautiful about it, except the great marble
courtyard and fountain. The inside, which is entirely
built of Oriental alabaster, is carpeted with magniﬁcent
Turkey carpets and hung with innumerable cut—glass
chandeliers, so that it looks like a huge vulgar drawing-
room from which the furniture has been cleared out for
dancing.
