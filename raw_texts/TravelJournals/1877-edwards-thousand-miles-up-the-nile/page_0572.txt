upon the wall'facing the entrance, and occupies it, not as
a tutelary divinity, but as a decorative device to separate
the two large subjects already described. Again, the
Gods represented in these subjects are Ra and Ammon
Ra, the tutelary Gods of the Great Temple; but if we
turn to the dedicatory inscription on page 505 we ﬁnd
that Thoth, whose image never occurs at all upon the
walls1 (unless as one of the little Gods in the cornice), is
really the presiding deity of the place. It is he who
welcomes Rameses and his offerings; who acknowledges
the “glory” given to him by his beloved son; and who,
, in return for the great and good monuments erected in
his honour, promises the king that he shall be given “a
long time to rule over the upper and lower country.”
Now Thoth was, par excel/671w, the God of Letters.
He is styled the Lord of Divine Words; the Lord of
the Sacred Writings; the Spouse of Truth. He per-
soniﬁes the Divine Intelligence. He is the patron of
art and science; and he is credited with the invention
of the alphabet. In one of the most interesting of
Champollion’s letters from Thebes? he relates how, in
the fragmentary ruins of the western extremity of the
Ramesseum, he found a doorway adorned with the

ﬁgures of Thoth and Saf ; Thoth as the God of Litera-

‘ He may, however, be represented on the North wall, where it is
covered by the sand-heap.
