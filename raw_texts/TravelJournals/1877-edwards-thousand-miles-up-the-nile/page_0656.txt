side chapel, a series of pitch-dark side chambers, and a
sanctuary. Outside all these, surrounding the actual
Temple on three sides, runs an external corridor open to
the sky, and bounded by a superb wall full forty feet in
height. When I have said that the entrance-front, with
its twin pylons and central doorway, measures 250 feet
in width by 125 feet in height; that the ﬁrst courtyard
measures more than 160 feet in length by 140 in width;
that the entire length of the building is 450 feet, and
that it covers an area of 80,000 square feet, I have stated
facts of a kind which convey no more than a general
idea of largeness to the ordinary reader. Of the
harmony of the proportions, of the amazing size and
strength of the individual parts, of the perfect workman-
ship, of the ﬁne 'grain and creamy amber of the stone, no
description can do more than suggest an indeﬁnite
noﬁon.

architect of Denderah has departed from his model, it has invariably
been for the worse.
