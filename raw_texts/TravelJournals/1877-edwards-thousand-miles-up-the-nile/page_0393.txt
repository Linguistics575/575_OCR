the fresher air that comes with sunset—to see the island,
in shape like an ancient Egyptian shield, lying mapped
out beneath one’s feet. From here, we look back upon
the way we have come, and forward to the way we are
going. Northward lies the Cataract—a network of islets
with ﬂashes of river between. Southward, the broad
current comes on in one smooth, glassy sheet, unbroken.
by a single rapid. How eagerly we turn our eyes that
way ; for yonder lie Aboo Simbel and all the mysterious
lands beyond the Cataracts! But we cannot see far, for
the river curves away grandly to the right, and vanishes
behind a range of granite hills. A similar chain hems in
the opposite bank; while high above the palm-groves
fringing the edge of the shore stand two ruined convents
on two rocky prominences, like a couple of castles on the
Rhine. On the East bank opposite, a few mud houses
and a group of superb carob trees mark the site of a vil-
lage, the greater part of which lies hidden among palms.
Behind this village opens a vast sand valley, like an arm
of the sea from which the waters have retreated. The
old channel along which we rode the other day went
ploughing that way straight across from Philae. Last of
all, forming the Western side of this fourfold view, we
have the island of Biggeh—rugged, mountainous, and
divided from Philae by so narrow a channel that every
sound from the native village on the opposite steep is as
audible as though it came from the courtyard at our feet.
