But when at last the edge of the desert is reached,
and the long sand-slope climbed, and the rocky platform
gained, and the Great Pyramid in all its unexpected bulk
and majesty towers close above one’s head, the effect is
as sudden as it is overwhelming. It shuts out the sky
and the horizon. It shuts out all the other Pyramids.
It shuts out everything but the sense of awe and wonder.

Now, too, one discovers that it was with the forms of
the Pyramids, and only their forms, that one had been
acquainted all these years past. Of their surface, their
colour, their relative position, their number (to say
nothing of their size), one had hitherto entertained no
kind of deﬁnite idea. The most careful study of plans
and measurements, the clearest photographs, the most
elaborate descriptions, had done little or nothing, after all,
to make one know the place beforehand. This undu-
lating table—land of sand and rock pitted with open
graves and cumbered with mounds of shapeless masonry,
is wholly unlike the desert of our dreams. The Pyramids
- of Cheops and Chephren are bigger than we had expected ;
the Pyramid of Mycerinus is smaller. Here, too, are
nine Pyramids, instead of three. They are all entered
in the plans and mentioned in the guide-books; but,
somehow, one is unprepared to ﬁnd them there, and
cannot help looking upon them as intruders. These six
extra Pyramids are small and greatly dilapidated. One,
indeed, is little more than a big cairn.
