Ptolemy Philadelphus, King Ouenephes built for himself
a pyramid at a place called Kochome. Now a tablet
of late discovered in the Serapeum by M. Mariette gives
the name of Ka-kem to the necropolis of Sakkarah;
and as the pyramid in stages is not only the largest on
this platform, but also the only one in which a royal
cartouche has been found, the conclusion seems obvious.

When a building has already lasted ﬁve or six thou-
sand years in a climate where mosses and lichens, and
all those natural signs of age to which we are accus-
tomed in Europe are unknown, it is not to be supposed
that a few centuries more or less can tell upon its
outward appearance; yet to my thinking the pyramid of
Ouenephes looks older than those of Geezeh. If this
be only fancy, it gives one, at all events, the impression
of belonging structurally to a ruder architectural period.
The idea of a monument composed of diminishing plat-
forms is in its nature more primitive than that of a
smooth four-sided pyramid; and though, as Dr. Lepsius
suggests, the smooth pyramids may all have been carried
up in stages and ﬁlled in afterwards, the ﬁlling-in seems
to be a later idea, and belongs apparently to a later period.
We remarked that the masonry on one side—I think on
the side facing eastwards—was in a much more perfect
condition than on either of the others.

Wilkinson describes the interior as “a hollow dome
supported here and there by wooden rafters,” and states
