ceiling is omitted on this side, so that the wall is literally
ﬁlled with the picture from top to bottom. -

Fully to describe this huge design would take many
pages. It is a picture-gallery in itself. It represents
not a single action but a whole campaign. It sets before
us, with Homeric simplicity, the pomp and circumstance
of war, the incidents of camp life, and the accidents of
the open ﬁeld. We see the enemy’s city with its
battlemented towers and triple moat; the besiegers’
camp and the pavilion of the king; the march of
infantry; the shock of chariots ; the hand-to-hand
melée ; the ﬂight of the vanquished; the triumph of the
Pharaoh; the bringing in of the prisoners; the counting
of the hands of the slain. A great river winds through
the picture from end to end, and almost surrounds the
invested city. The king in his chariot pursues a crowd
of fugitives along the bank. Some are crushed under
his wheels; some plunge into the water and are
drowned.1 Behind him, a moving wall of shields and
spears, advances with rhythmic step the serried phalanx;
while yonder, where the ﬁght is thickest, we see chariots
overturned, men dead and dying, and riderless horses
making for the Open. Meanwhile the besieged send out
mounted scouts, and the country folk drive their cattle
to the hills.
