The external decorations of the two lodges are of
especial interest. The lower subjects are historical.
Those upon the upper storeys are domestic or symbo-
lical, and are among the most celebrated of Egyptian
has-reliefs. They have long been supposed to represent
Rameses III. in his hareem, entertained and waited upon
by female slaves. In one group the king, distinguished
always by his cartouches, sits at ease in a kind of folding
chair, his helmet on his head, his sandalled feet upon a
footstool, as one returned and resting after battle. In
his left hand he holds a round object like a fruit. With
the right he chucks under the chin an ear-ringed and
necklaced damsel who presents a lotus blossom at his
nose. In another much mutilated subject, they are
represented playing a game at draughts. This famous
subject—which can only be seen when the light strikes
sidewisemwould scarcely be intelligible save for the help
one derives from the cuts in Wilkinson and the plates in
Rosellini. It is not that the sculptures are effaced, but
that the great blocks which bore them are gone from their
places, having probably been hurled down bodily upon the
heads of the enemy during a certain siege of which the
ruins bear evident traces.l Of the'lady, there remains

‘ Medinet Haboo continued up to the period of the Arab invasion
to be inhabited by the Coptic descendants of its ancient builders.
