savoury, good-humoured, inoffensive throng, one glance
at which was enough to put to ﬂight all one’s preconceived
notions about Oriental gravity of demeanour! For the
truth is that gravity is by no means an Oriental charac—
teristic. Take a Mahommedan at his devotions, and he
is a model of religious abstraction; bargain with him for a
carpet, and he is as impenetrable as a judge; but see him
in his hours of relaxation, or on the occasion of a public
holiday, and he is as garrulous and full of laughter as a
big child. Like a child, too, he loves noise and movement
for the mere sake of noise and movement, and looks
upon swings and ﬁreworks as the height of human felicity.
Now swings and ﬁreworks are Arabic for bread and cir-
cuses, and our pleb’s passion for them is insatiable. He
not only indulges in them upon every occasion of public
rejoicing, but calls in their aid to celebrate the most
solemn festivals of his religion. It so happened that we
afterwards came in the way of several Mahommedan
fétes both in Egypt and Syria, and we invariably found
the swings at work all day and the ﬁreworks going off
every evening.

To—day, the swings outside the Bab en-Nasr were
never idle. Here were creaking Russian swings hung

swings, some of them as high as Haman’s gallows, for
the men. For my own part, I know no sight much
more comic and incongruous than the serene enjoyment
