Pyramid, which is supposed to have been some four
thousand two hundred and odd years old at the time of
the birth of Christ, is now in its seventh millennary.
Standing there close against the base of it; touching it;
measuring her own height against one of its lowest
blocks; looking up all the stages of that vast, receding.
rugged wall, that leads upward like an Alpine buttress
and seems almost to touch the sky, the writer suddenly
became aware that these remote dates had never pre-
sented themselves to her mind until this moment as
anything but abstract numerals. Now for the ﬁrst
time they resolved themselves into something concrete,
deﬁnite, real. They were no longer ﬁgures, but years
with their changes of season, their high and low Niles,
their seed-times and harvests. The consciousness of
that moment will never, perhaps, quite wear away.
It was as if one had been snatched up for an instant
to some vast height overlooking the plains of Time,
and had seen the centuries mapped out beneath one’s
feet.

To appreciate the size of the Great Pyramid is less
difﬁcult than to apprehend its age. No one who has

walked the length of one side, climbed to the top, and
learned the dimensions from Murray, can fail to form a
tolerably clear idea of its mere bulk. The measurements
given by Sir Gardner Wilkinson are as follows :——length
of each side, 732 feet; perpendicular height, 480 feet
