were they, that not even our unhallowed presence seemed
to disturb them. We did not then know that the pious
Moslem is as devout out of the mosque as in it; or that
it is his habit to pray when the appointed hours come
round, no matter where he may be, or how occupied.
We soon became so familiar, however, with this obvious
trait of Mahommedan life, that it seemed quite a matter
of course that the camel-driver should dismount and lay
his forehead in the dust by the roadside; or the
merchant spread his prayer-carpet on the narrow mas-
tabah of his little shop in the public bazaar; or the boatman
prostrate himself with his face to the east, as the sun
went down behind the hills of the Libyan desert.

While we were admiring the spring of the roof and
the intricate Arabesque decorations of the pulpit, a
custode came up with a big key, and invited us to visit
the tomb of the founder. So we followed him into an
enormous vaulted hall a hundred feet square, in the
centre of which stood a plain, railed-off tomb, with an
empty iron-bound coffer at the foot. We afterwards
learned that for ﬁve hundred years—that is to say ever
since the death and burial of Sultan Hassan—this coffer
had contained a ﬁne copy of the Koran, traditionally said
to have been written by Sultan Hassan's own hand; but
that the Khedive, who is collecting choice and antique
Arabic MSS., had only the other day sent an order for
its removal.
