Moodeer, were busy getting off all that could be saved
from the wreck.

As evening drew on, our head-wind became a hurri-
cane; and that hurricane lasted, day and night, for
thirty-six hours. All this time the Nile was driving up
against the current in great rollers, like rollers on the
Cornish coast when tide and wind set together from the
west. To hear them roaring past in the darkness of the
night—to feel the Philze rocking, shivering, straining at
her mooring-ropes, and bumping perpetually against the
bank, was far from pleasant. By day, the scene was
extraordinary. There were no clouds; but the air was
thick with sand, through which the sun glimmered
feebly. Some palms, looking gray and ghost-like on the

bank above, bent as if they must break before the blast.
‘ The Nile was yeasty, and ﬂecked with brown foam,
large lumps of which came swirling every now and then
against our cabin windows. The opposite bank was
simply nowhere. Judging only by what was visible from
the deck, one would have vowed that the Dahabeeyah
was moored against an open coast, with an angry sea
coming in.

The wind fell about ﬁve A.M. the second day; when
the men at once took to their oars, and by breakfast-time
brought us to Edfoo. Nothing now could be more
delicious than the weather. It was a cool, silvery, misty

morning—such a morning as one never knows in Nubia,
