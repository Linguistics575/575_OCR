Lastly, there are the minor inconveniences of sun,
sand, wind, and ﬂies. The whole place radiates heat,
and seems almost to radiate light. The glare from
above and the glare from below are alike intolerable.
Dazzled, blinded, unable to even look at his subject
without the aid of smoke-coloured glasses, the sketcher
whose tent is pitched upon the sandslope over against
the great Temple, enjoys a foretaste of cremation.

When the wind blows from the north (which at this
time of the year is almost always) the heat is perhaps
less distressing, but the sand is maddening. It ﬁlls
your hair, your eyes, your water-bottles; silts up your
colour-box; dries into your skies; and reduces your
Chinese white to a gritty paste the colour of salad-
dressing. As for the ﬂies, they have a morbid appetite
for water-colours. They follow your wet brush along
the paper, leave their legs in the yellow ochre, and
plunge with avidity into every little pool of cobalt as it
is mixed ready for use. Nothing disagrees with them;
nothing poisons them—not even olive-green.

It was a delightful time, however—idelightful alike
for those who worked and those who rested—and these
small troubles counted for nothing in the scale. Yet
it was pleasant, all the same, to break away for a day or
two, and be off to W ady Halfeh.
