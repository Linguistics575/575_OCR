To come out from these black holes into the twilight
of the Great Hall and see the landscape set, as it were,
in the ebon frame of the doorway, was alone worth the
journey to Aboo Simbel. The sun being at such times
in the west, the river, the yellow sand-island, the palms
and tamarisks opposite, and the mountains of the eastern
desert, were all ﬂooded with a glory of light and colour
to which no pen or pencil could possibly do justice.
Not even the mountains of Moab in Holman Hunt’s
“ Scapegoat ” were so warm with rose and gold.

Thus our days passed at Aboo Simbel; the workers
working; the idlers idling; strangers from the outer
world now and then coming and going. The heat on
shore was great, especially in the sketching-tents; but
the north breeze blewsteadily every day from about an
hour after sunrise till an hour before sunset, and on
board the Dahabeeyah it was always cool.

The Happy Couple took advantage of this good
wind to do a good deal of boating, and by judiciously
timing their excursions, contrived to use the tail of the
day's breeze for their trip out, and the strong arms of
four good rowers to bring them back again. In this
way they managed to see the little rock-cut Temple of
Ferayg, which the rest of us unfortunately missed. On
another occasion they paid a visit to a certain Sheyhk
who lived at a village about two miles south of Aboo
Simbel. He was a great man, as Nubian magnates go.
