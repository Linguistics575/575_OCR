anything is changed. If a sound of antique chanting
were to be borne along the quiet 'air—if a procession of
white-robed priests bearing aloft the veiled ark of the
God, were to come sweeping round between the palms
and the pylons -——~we should not think it strange.

Most travellers land at the end nearest the Cataract;
so coming upon the principal temple from behind, and
seeing it in reverse order. We, however, bid our Arabs
row round to the southern end, where was once a stately
landing-place with steps down to the river. We skirt the
steep banks, and pass close under the beautiful little
rooﬂess Temple commonly known as Pharaoh’s Bed—
that Temple which has been so often painted, so often
photographed, that every stone of it, and the platform on
which it stands, and the tufted palms that cluster round
about it, have been since childhood as familiar to our
mind’s eye as the Sphinx or the Pyramids. It is larger,
but not one jot less beautiful than we had expected. And
it is exactly like the photographs. Still, one is conscious
of perceiving a shade of difference too subtle for analysis ;
like the difference between a familiar face and the reﬂec—
tion of it in a looking-glass. Anyhow, one feels that the
real Pharaoh’s Bed will henceforth displace the photo-
graphs in that obscure mental pigeon-hole where till now
one has been wont to store the well-known image; and
that even the photographs have undergone some kind of
change.
