##‘_—

 

limestone of which it is built seems to have mellowed
and turned golden with time. N o walls enclose it. No
towering pylons overshadow it. It stands high, and the
air circulates freely among those simple and beautiful
columns. There are not many Egyptian ruins in which
one can talk and be merry; but in the Ramesseum one
may thoroughly enjoy the passing hour.

\Vhether Rameses the Great was ever actually
buried in this place is a mystery which future discoveries
may possibly solve; but that the Ramesseum and the
tomb of Osymandias were one and the same building is
a point upon which I never entertained a moment’s
doubt. Spending day after day among these ruins;
sketching now here, now there; going over the ground
bit by bit, and comparing every detail, I came at last to
wonder how an identity so obvious could ever have been
doubted. Diodorus was of course inaccurate; but then
one as little looks for accuracy in Diodorus as in Homer.
Compared with some of his topographical descriptions,
the account he gives of the Ramesseum is a marvel of
exactness. He describes‘ a building approached by two
vast courtyards; a hall of pillars opening by way of three
entrances from the second courtyard; a succession of
chambers, including a sacred library; ceilings of azure

’ Diodorus, Bilzliot/z. IﬁsL, Bk. i. chap. iv. The fault of inaccuracy

ought, however, to be charged to Hecataeus, who was the authority
followed here by Diodorus.
