“bespangled with stars ;” walls covered with sculptures
representing the deeds and triumphs of the king whom
he calls Osymandias,1 amongst which are particularly
noticed the assault of a fortress “environed by a
river,” a procession of captives without hands, and a
series of all the Gods of Egypt, to whom the King was
represented in the act of making offerings; ﬁnally,

of the King, one of which, being of Syenite granite and
made “in a sitting posture,” is stated to be not only “the
greatest in all Egypt,” but admirable above all others
“ for its workmanship, and the excellence of the stone.”
Bearing in mind that what is left of the Ramesseum

cartouche is found by Brugsch on a sarc0phagus in the museum at
Vienna; see flirt. d’Egypte, chap. x. p. 213, ed. 1859. Another
claimant to this identiﬁcation is found in a King named Se-Mentu,
whose cartouches have been found by M. Mariette on some small gold
tablets at Tanis.
