and swims off to repeat the same performance on board
the Bagstones.

From this moment the prosperity of our voyage is
assured. The captain goes about with a smile on his
. stern face, and the crew look as happy as if we had given
them a guinea. For nothing can go wrong with a
Dahabeeyah that has been “made holy” by Holy Sheykh
Cotton. We are certain now to have favourable winds
——to pass the Cataract without accident—to come back
in health and safety, as we set out. But what, it may be
asked, has Holy Sheykh Cotton done to make his bless-
ing so efﬁcacious? He gets money in plenty; he fasts
no oftener than other Mahommedans; he has two wives;
he never does a stroke of work; and he looks the picture
of sleek prosperity. Yet he is a saint of the ﬁrst water;
and when he dies, miracles will be performed at his
tomb, and his eldest son will succeed him in the business.

We had the pleasure of becoming acquainted with a
good many saints in the course of our Eastern travels;
but I do not know that we ever found they had done
anything to merit the position. One very horrible old
man named Sheykh Saleem has, it is true, been sitting
on a dirt heap near Farshoot, unclothed, unwashed,
unshaven, for the last half-century or more, never even
lifting his hand to his mouth to feed himself; but
Sheykh Cotton had gone to no such pious lengths, and
was not even dirty.
