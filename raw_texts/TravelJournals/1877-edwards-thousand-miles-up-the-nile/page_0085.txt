three dahabeeyahs moored over yonder in the shade of
the palms, the biggest by far, and the trimmest, is our
own dear, memorable ‘ Philae.’ ‘

Close behind the Philae lies the Bagstones,—a neat
little dahabeeyah in the occupation of two English ladies
who chanced to cross with us in the Simla from Brindisi,
and of whom we have seen so much ever since that we
regard them by this time as quite old friends in a
strange land. I will call them the M. B.’s. The other
boat, lying off a few yards ahead, carries the tricolor,
and is chartered by a party of French gentlemen. All
three are to sail to-day.

And now we are on board, and have shaken hands
with the captain, and are as busy as bees; for there are
cabins to put in order, flowers to arrange, and a
hundred little things to be seen to before the guests
arrive. It is wonderful, however, what a few books and
roses, an open piano, and a sketch or two, will do. In a
few minutes the comfortless hired look has vanished, and
long enough before the ﬁrst comers are announced, the
Phila: wears an aspect as cosy and home-like as if she
had been occupied for a month.

As for the luncheon, it certainly surprised the givers
of the entertainment quite as much as it must have sur-
prised their guests. Being, no doubt, a pre-arranged
display of professional pride on the part of dragoman and
cook, it was more like an excessive Christmas dinner
