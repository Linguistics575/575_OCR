behind; to have done with the teachings of the present;
to belong one’s self to the past. The very Gods assert
their ancient inﬂuence over those who question them in
solitude. Seen in the fast-deepening gloom of evening,
they look instinct with supernatural life. There were
times when I should scarcely have been surprised to hear
them speak— to see them rise from their painted thrones
and come down from the walls. There were times when
I felt I believed in them.

There was something so weird and awful about the
place, and it became so much more weird and awful the
farther one went in, that I rarely ventured beyond the
ﬁrst hall when quite alone. One afternoon, however,
when it was a little earlier, and therefore a little lighter,
than usual, I went to the very end, and sat at the feet of
the Gods in the sanctuary. All at once (I cannot tell
why, for my thoughts just then were far away) it flashed
upon me that a whole mountain hung—ready, perhaps,
to cave in—above my head. Seized by a sudden panic
such as one feels in dreams, I tried to run; but my feet
dragged, and the ﬂoor seemed to sink under them. I felt
I could not have called for help, though it had been to
save my life. It is unnecessary, perhaps, to add that the
mountain did not cave in, and that I had my fright for
nothing. It would have been a grand way of dying, all
the same; and a still grander way of being buried.

My visits to the Great Temple were not always so
