specimen in the Regent’s Park. Meanwhile a strange
excitement breaks out among our crew. They crowd to
the side; they shout; they gesticulate; the captain
salaams; the steersman waves his hand; all eyes are
turned towards the shore.

“ Do you see Sheykh Seleem ?” cries Talhamy
breathlessly, rushing up from below. “ There he is!
Look at him! That is Sheykh Seleem !”

And so we ﬁnd out that it is not a monkey but a
man—and not only a man, but a saint. Holiest of the
holy, dirtiest of the dirty, white-pated, white-bearded,
withered, bent, and knotted up, is the renowned Sheykh
Seleem—he who, naked and unwashed, has sat on that
same spot every day through summer heat and winter cold
for the last ﬁfty years ; never providing himself with food
or water; never even lifting his hand to his mouth; de-
pending on charity not only for his food but for his feeding!
He is not nice to look at, even by this dim light and at
this distance; but the sailors think him quite beautiful,
and call aloud to him for his blessing as we go by.

“ It is not by our own will that we sail past, 0
father!” they cry. “ Fain would we kiss thy hand; but
the wind blows and the mérkeb (boat) goes, and we have
no power to stay!”

But Sheykh Seleem neither lifts his head nor shows
any sign of hearing, and in a few minutes the mound on
which he sits is left behind in the gloaming.
