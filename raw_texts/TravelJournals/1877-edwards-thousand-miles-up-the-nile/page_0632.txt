BACK THROUGH NUBIA. 567

Next evening came a woful deputation from Torri-
goor, entreating forgiveness, and stating that ﬁfteen
villagers had been swept off to prison.

The Idle Man explained that he no longer had any-
thing to do with it; that the matter, in short, was in the
hands of justice, and would be dealt with according to
law. Hereupon the spokesman gathered up a handful of
imaginary dust, and made believe to scatter it on his head.

“ O dragoman ! ” he said, “ tell the Howadji that there
is no law but his pleasure, and no justice but the will of
the Governor ! ”

Summoned next morning to give evidence, the Idle
Man went betimes to Assouan, where he was received in
private by the Governor and Moodeer. Pipes and coffee
were handed, and the usual civilities exchanged. The
Governor then informed his guest that ﬁfteen men of
Torrigoor had been arrested; and that fourteen of them
unanimously identiﬁed the ﬁfteenth as the one who
struck the blow.

“And now,” said the Governor, “before we send for
the prisoners, it will be as well to decide on the sentence.
What does his Excellency wish done to them P”

The Idle Man was puzzled. How could he offer an
opinion, being ignorant of the Egyptian civil code? and
how could the sentence be decided upon before the trial ?

The Governor smiled serenely.

“ But,” he said, “this is the trial.”
