shining, the thermometer takes the place of the weather
as a useful platitude. Knowing that Assouan enjoys
the hottest reputation of any town on the surface of the
globe, we were agreeably surprised to ﬁnd it no warmer
than England in September. The Governor accounted
for this by saying that he had never known so cold a
winter. We then asked the usual questions about the
crops, the height of the river, and so forth ; to all of which
he replied with the ease and (ion/zomz'e of a man of the
world. Nubia, he said, was healthy——the date-harvest
had been abundant—the corn promised well——-the
Soudan was quiet and prosperous. Referring to the
new postal arrangements, he congratulated us on being
able to receive and post letters at the Second Cataract.
He also remarked that the telegraphic wires were now
in working order as far as Khartoom. We then asked
how soon he expected the railway to reach Assouan; to
which he replied—“ In two years, at latest.”

At length our little stock of topics came to an end,
and the entertainment ﬂagged.

“ What shall I say next P” asked the dragoman.

“ Tell him we particularly wish to see the slave-market.”

The smile vanished from the Governor’s face. The
Mudeer set down a glass of ﬁzzing lemonade, untasted.
The Kadee all but dr0pped his cigar. If a shell had
burst in the saloon, their consternation could scarcely
have been greater.
