surely not least among the glories of learning, that those
who adorn it most and work hardest should ever be
readiest to share the stores of their knowledge.

I am anxious also to express my cordial thanks
to Mr. G. Pearson, under whose superintendence
the whole of the illustrations have been engraved.
To say that his patience and courtesy have been
inexhaustible, and that he has spared neither time
nor cost in the preparation of the blocks, is but a
dry statement of facts, and conveys no idea of the
kind of labour involved. Where engravings of this
kind are executed, not from drawings made at ﬁrst-
hand upon the wood, but from water-colour drawings
which have not only to be reduced in size, but
to be, as it were, translated into black and white, the
difﬁculty of the work is largely increased. In order
to meet this difﬁculty and to ensure accuracy, Mr.
Pearson has not only called in the services of accom-
plished draughtsmen, but in many instances has even
photographed the subjects direct upon the wood. Of
the engraver’s work—which speaks for itself—I will
only say that I do not know in what way it could
be bettered. It seems to me that some of these
blocks may stand for examples of the farthest point
to which the art of engraving upon wood has yet been
carried.

The principal illustrations have all been drawn upon
