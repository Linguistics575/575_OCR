the most exquisite curves and wreaths, like a snow-
drift turned to gold. Remodelled by every breath that
blows, its ever—varying surface presents an endless play
of delicate lights and shadows. There lives not the
sculptor who could render those curves; and I doubt
whether Turner himself, in his tenderest and subtlest
mood, could have done justice to those complex greys
and ambers.

Having paused to rest upon an out-cropping ledge
of rock about half-way up, we came at length to the top
of the last slope and found ourselves on the level of the
desert. Here, faithful to the course of the river, the
ﬁrst objects to meet our eyes were the old familiar
telegraph-posts and wires. Beyond them, to North and
South, a crowd of peaks 'closed in the view; but West-
ward, a rolling waste of hillock and hollow opened away
to where the sun, a crimson globe, had already half-
vanished below the rim of the world.

One could not resist going a few steps farther, just
to touch the nearest of those telegraph posts. It was
like reaching out a hand towards home.

When the sun dr0pped, we turned back. The valley
below was already steeped in dusk. The Nile, glimmer-
ing like a coiled snake in the shade, reflected the
evening sky in three separate reaches. On the Arabian
side, a far-off mountain-chain stood out, purple and
jagged, against the Eastern horizon.
