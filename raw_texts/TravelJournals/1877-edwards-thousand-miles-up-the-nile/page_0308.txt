skull-cap ; his stock in trade, of a greasy leather fringe
tied to the end of a stick. Flying from window to
window of the saloon on the side next the shore,
scrambling up the bows of a neighbouring cargo-boat so
as to attack us in the rear, thrusting his stick and fringe
in our faces whichever way we turn, and pursuing us with
eager cries of “ Madame Nubia! Madame Nubia!” he
skips, and screams, and grins like an ubiquitous goblin,
and throws every competitor into the shade.

Having seen a similar fringe in the collection of a
friend at home, I at once recognised in “Madame
Nubia ” one of those curious girdles which, with the
addition of a necklace and a few bracelets, form the
entire wardrobe of little girls south of the Cataract.
They vary in size according to the age of the wearer;
the largest being about twelve inches in depth and
twenty-ﬁve in length. A few are ornamented with beads
and small shells; but these are parures de luxe. The
ordinary article is cheaply and unpretentiously trimmed
with castor-oil. That is to say, the girdle when new is
well soaked in the oil, which softens and darkens the
leather, besides adding a perfume dear to native nostrils.

For to the Nubian, who grows his own plants and
bruises his own berries, this odour is delicious. He
reckons castor-oil among his greatest luxuries. He eats
it as we eat butter. His wives saturate their plaited
locks in it. His little girls perfume their fringes with it.
