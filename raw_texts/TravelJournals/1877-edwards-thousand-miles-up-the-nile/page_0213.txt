light and shadow that were vivid—it was colour that was
present. Colour neither deadened nor changed ; but
softened, glowing, spiritualised. The amber sheen of the
sand-island in the middle of the river, the sober green of
the palm-grove, the Little Lady’s turquoise-coloured hood,
were clear to the sight and relatively true in tone. The
oranges showed through the bars of the crate, like
nuggets of pure gold. L.’s crimson shawl glowed with a
warmer dye than it ever wore by day. The mountains
were ﬂushed as if in the light of sunset. Of all the
natural phenomena that we beheld in the course of the
journey, I remember none that surprised us more than
this. We could scarcely believe at ﬁrst that it was not
some effect of afterglow, or some miraculous aurora of
the East. But the sun had nothing to do with that
ﬂush upon the mountains. The glow was in the stone,
and the moonlight but revealed the local colour.

For some days before they came in sight we had
been eagerly looking for the Theban hills; and now, after
a night of rapid sailing, we woke one morning to ﬁnd the
. sun rising on the wrong side of the boat, the favourable
wind dead against us, and a picturesque chain of broken
peaks upon our starboard bow. By these signs we
knew that we must have come to the great bend in the
river between How and Keneh, and that these new
mountains, so much more varied in form than those of
Middle Egypt, must be the mountains behind Denderah.
