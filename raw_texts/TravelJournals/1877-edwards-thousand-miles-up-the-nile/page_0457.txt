Egyptian sources, it will almost certainly be through
the medium of documents such as these.

An unusually long reign, the last forty-six years of
which would seem to have been spent in peace and
outward prosperity, enabled Rameses II. to indulge
his ruling passion without interruption. To draw up
anything like an exhaustive catalogue of his known archi-
tectural works would be equivalent to writing an itinerary
of Egypt and Ethiopia under the XIXth Dynasty. His
designs were as vast as his means appear to have been
unlimited. From the Delta to Gebel Barkal, he
ﬁlled the land with monuments dedicated to his own
glory and the worship of the Gods. Upon Thebes,
Abydos, and Tanis, he lavished structures of surpassing

magniﬁcence. In Nubia, at the places now known as

Gerf Hossayn, Wady Sabooah, Derr, and Aboo Simbel,
he was the author of temples and the founder of cities.
These cities, which would probably be better described
as provincial towns, have disappeared; and but for the
mention of them in various inscriptions we should not
even know that they had existed. Who shall say how
many more have vanished, leaving neither trace nor
record ? A dozen cities of Rameses1 may yet lie buried
under some of those nameless mounds that follow each

1 The Pa-Rameses of the Bible narrative was not the only Egyptian
city of that name. There was a Pa-Rameses near Memphis, and another
Pa-Rameses at Aboo-Simbel ; and there may probably have been many
more.
