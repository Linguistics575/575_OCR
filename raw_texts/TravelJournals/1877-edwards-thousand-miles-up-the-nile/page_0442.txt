Rameses 11. Let us then, while the Philee lies moored
in the shadow of the rock of Abshek,l review, as sum-
marily as may be, the leading facts of ’ this important
reign; such facts, that is to say, as are recorded in
inscriptions, papyri, and other contemporary monuments.

Rameses the Second2 was the son of Seti I., the
second Pharaoh of the XIXth Dynasty, and of a
certain Princess Tuaa, described on the monuments as
“royal wife, royal mother, and heiress and sharer of the
throne.” She is supposed to have been of the ancient
royal line of the preceding dynasty, and so to have had,
perhaps, a better right than her husband to the double

’ In the present state of Egyptian chronology, it is hazardous to
assign even an approximate date to events that happened before the
conquest of Cambyses. The Egyptians, in fact, had no chronology in
the strict sense of the word. Being without any ﬁxed point of
departure, such as the birth of Christ, they counted the events of each
reign from the accession of the sovereign. Under such a system error
and confusion were inevitable. To say when Rameses II. was born
and when he died is impossible. The very century in which he
ﬂourished is uncertain. M. Mariette, taking the historical lists of
Manetho for his basis, supposes the XIXth Dynasty to have
occupied the interval comprised within B.C. 1462 and 1288 ; according
to which computation (allowing 57 years for the reigns of Rameses I.
and Seti I.) the reign of Rameses II. would date from B.C. I405.
Brugsch gives him from B.C. 1407 to B.C. r341 ; and Lepsius places
his reign in the sixty-six years lying between B.C. 1388 and B.C. I322 ;
