curious fragments of glass and pottery, and part of an en-
graved bronze Apis; and we had a green, tranquil, lovely
day, barren of incident, but very pleasant to remember.

The good wind continued to blow all that night; but
fell at sunrise, precisely when we were about to start.
The river now stretched away before us, smooth as
glass, and there was nothing for it, said Re'fs Hassan,
but tracking. We had heard of tracking often enough
since coming to Egypt; but without having any deﬁnite
idea of the process. Coming on deck, however, before
breakfast, we found nine of our poor fellows harnessed to
a r0pe like barge-horses, towing the huge boat against
the current. Seven of the M. B.’s crew, similarly
harnessed, followed at a few yards’ distance. The two
ropes met and crossed and dipped into the water to-
gether. Already our last night’s mooring-place was out
of sight; and the Pyramid of Ouenephes stood up amid
its lesser brethren on the edge of the desert, as if bidding
us good-bye. But the sight of the trackers jarred,
somehow, with the placid beauty of the picture. We got
used to it, as one gets used to everything, in time; but
it looked like slaves’ work, and shocked our English
notions disagreeably.

That morning, still tracking, we pass the Pyramids
of Dashoor. A dilapidated brick Pyramid standing in the
midst of them, looks like an aiguille of black rock thrusting
itself up through the limestone bed of the desert. Palms
