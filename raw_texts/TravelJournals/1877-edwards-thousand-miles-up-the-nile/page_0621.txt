structions, of which the Painter counted eighteen, have
long been the puzzle of travellers.‘

Tafah is charmingly placed; and the seven miles
which divide it from Kalabsheh—once, no doubt, the
scene of a cataract—are perhaps the most picturesque on
this side of Wady Halfeh. Rocky islets in the river;
palm-groves, acacias, carobs, henna and castor-berry
bushes, and all kinds of ﬂowering shrubs, along the edges
of the banks; fantastic precipices riven and pinnacled,
here rising abruptly from the water’s edge, and there
from the sandy plain, make lovely sketches whichever
way one turns. There are gazelles, it is said, in the
ravines behind Tafah; and one of the natives—a trucu-
lent fellow in a ragged shirt and dirty white turban-—
tells how, at a distance of three hours up a certain glen,
there is another Birbeh, larger than either of these in the
plain, and a great standing statue taller than three men.

' They probably mark the site of a certain C0ptic monastery de-
scribed in an ancient Arabic MS. quoted by E. Quatremere, which
says that “in the town of Tafah there is a ﬁne monastery called the
monastery of Ansoun. It is very ancient; but so solidly built, that
after so great a number of years it still stands uninjured. Near this
monastery, facing the mountain, are situated ﬁfteen villages.” See
Alémoires 1713!. at Géogmp/u'gues sur 1’ E (gym at I: Nubia, par E.
QUATREMERE. Paris, 1811, vol. ii. p. 55.

The monastery and the villages were, doubtless, of Romano-
Egyptian construction in the ﬁrst instance, and may originally have
been a sacred College, like the sacred College at Philze.
