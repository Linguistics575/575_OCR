TRANSLATION—(By S. Birch, Esq., LL.D., etc.)

 

 

 

“ Beloved by Amen Ra, King of the Gods resident in
the Land of Kenus.”l

Beyond this point, at the end nearest the N.E.
corner of the chamber, the piled sand conceals whatever

else the wall may contain in the way of decoration.

EAST WALL.

If the east wall is decorated like the others (which
may be taken for granted), its tableaux and inscriptions
are hidden behind the sand which here rises to the
ceiling. The doorway also occurs in this wall, occupy-
ing a space 4 feet 3% inches in width on the inner side.

' Xmas—Nubia.
