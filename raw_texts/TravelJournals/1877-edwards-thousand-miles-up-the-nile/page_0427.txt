sat enthroned at the upper end of the sanctuary; but they
have shared the fate of the colossi outside, and only their
feet remain. The wall sculptures of this dark little
chamber are, however, better preserved, and better worth
preservation, than those of the hall. A procession of
priests, bearing on their shoulders the bari, or sacred
boat, is quite unharmed ; and even the colour is yet fresh
upon a full-length ﬁgure of Hathor close by.

But more interesting than all these-—more interesting
because more rare——is a sculptured palm-tree against
which the king leans while making an offering to Ammon
Ra. The trunk is given with elaborate truthfulness;
and the branches, though formalised, are correct and
graceful in curvature. The tree is but an accessory. It
may have been introduced with reference to the date-
harvests which are the wealth of the district; but it has
no kind of sacred signiﬁcance, and is noticeable only
for the naturalness of the treatment. Such naturalness
is unusual in the art of this period, when the con-
ventional persea and the equally conventional lotus
are almost the only vegetable forms that appear on
the walls of the Temples. I can recall, indeed, but
one similar instance in the bas-relief sculpture of the
New Empire—~namely, the bent, broken, and waving
bulrushes in the great lion-hunting scene at Medinet
Haboot, which are admirably free, and studied apparently
from nature.
