 

ASSO UAN AND ELEPHANTINE. 269

 

We little dreamed 'that Dr. Birch, in his cheerless
ofﬁcial-room at the British Museum so many thousand
miles away, was at this very time occupied in deciphering
a collection of similar fragments, nearly all of which had
been brought from this same spot.1 Of the curious

I The results of Dr. Birch’s labour were given to the public in his
“ Guide to the First and Second Egyptian Rooms,” published by order
of the Trustees of the British Museum in May 1874. Of the contents
of case 99, in the Second Room, he says, “The use of potsherds for
documents received a great extension at the time of the Roman
Empire, when receipts for the taxes were given on these fragments by
the collectors of revenue at Elephantine or Syene, on the frontier of
Egypt. These receipts commenced in the reign of Vespasian, A.D. 77,
and are found as late as M. Aurelius and L. Verus, A.D. 165. It
appears from them that the capitation and trades tax, which was 16
drachms in AJ). 77, rose to 20 in AD. 165, having steadily increased.
The dues were paid in instalments called mcrzirmoi, at three periods of
the year. The taxes were farmed out to publicans, mitt/total} who
appear from their names to have been Greeks. At Elephantine the
taxes were received by tax-gatherers, prakterar, who seem to have been
appointed as early as the Ptolemies. Their clerks were Egyptians, and
they had a chest and treasurer, pity/ax.” See p. 109, a: above; also
Birch’s [armory of Ancient Poﬂery, chap. i. p. 45.

These barren memoranda are not the only literary curiosities found
at Elephantine. Among the Egyptian MSS. of the Louvre may be
seen some fragments of the XVIIIth book of the Iliad, discovered in a
tomb upon the island. How they came to be buried there no one
knows. A lover of poetry would like to think, however, that some
Greek or Roman ofﬁcer, dying at his post upon this distant station,
desired, perhaps, to have his Homer laid with him in his grave.
