and justiﬁed, at the last stage of his spiritual journey.
He is welcomed by the Gods, ushered into the presence
of Osiris, and received into the Abode of the Blest.1

Coming out for a few moments into blinding daylight,
we drink a long draught of pure air, cross a few yards of
uneven ground, arrive at the mouth of another excava-
tion, and plunge again into underground darkness. A
third and a fourth time we repeat this strange experience.
It is like a feverish sleep, troubled by gruesome dreams,
and broken by momentary wakings.

form, erect, with one foot advanced, as if walking, the right hand hold-
ing the Tau, or symbol of life, the left hand grasping a staff. The
attitude is that of the wooden statue at Boulak ; and it is worth
remark that the ﬁgures stand detached, with no support at the back, .
which was never the case with those carved in stone or granite. There
can be no doubt that this curious series of funeral statues represents
those which were actually placed in the tomb 3 and that the ceremonies
here represented were actually performed before them, previous to
closing the mouth of the sepulchre. One of these very wooden
statues, from this very tomb, was brought to England by Belzoni, and
is now in the British Museum (No. 854, Central Saloon). The wood is
much decayed, and the statue ought undoubtedly to be placed under
glass. The tableaux representing the above ceremonies are well c0pied
in Rosellini, Mon. dc! Culto, plates 60-63.

1 A remarkable inscription in this tomb, relating the wrath of Ra
and the destruction of mankind, is translated by M. Naville, Vol. iv.
Pt. i., Transaction: qf lite Bz'bliral A rr/z. Society. In this singular
myth, which bears a family resemblance to the Chaldaean record of the
Flood, the deluge is a deluge of human blood. The inscription covers
the walls of a small chamber known as the Chamber of the Cow.
