This being so, the traveller is ill equipped who goes
through Egypt without something more than a mere
guide—book knowledge of Rameses II. He is, as it
were, content to read the Argument and miss the Poem.
In the desolation of Memphis, in the shattered splendour
of Thebes, he sees only the ordinary pathos of ordinary
ruins. As for Aboo Simbel, the most stupendous his-
torical record ever transmitted from the past to the
present, it tells him a but half-intelligible story. Hold-
ing to the merest thread of explanation, he wanders from
hall to hall, lacking altogether that potent charm of fore—
gone association which no Murray can furnish. Your
average Frenchman straying helplessly through West-
minster Abbey under the conduct of the verger has
about as vague a conception of the historical import of
the things he sees. ,

What is true of the traveller is equally true of those
who take their Nile vicariously “in connection with
Mudie.” If they are to understand any description of
Aboo Simbel, they must ﬁrst know something about
