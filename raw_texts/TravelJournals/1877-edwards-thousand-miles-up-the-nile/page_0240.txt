mount, and go beside us all the way. Their attitudes
are so natural, their forms so roundly cut, that one could
almost fancy them in motion as the lights ﬂicker by.
' Surely there must be some one weird night in the year
when they step out from their places, and take up the
next verse of their chanted hymn, and, to the sound of
instruments long mute and songs long silent, pace the
moonlit roof in ghostly order!

The sun is already down and the crimson light has
faded, when at length we emerge upon that vast terrace.
The rooﬁng-stones are gigantic. Striding to and fro
over some of the biggest, our Idle Man ﬁnds several that
measure seven paces in length by four in breadth. In
yonder distant corner, like a little stone lodge in a vast
courtyard, stands a small temple supported on Hathor-
headed columns; while at the Eastern end, forming a
second and loftier stage, rises the roof of the portico.

Meanwhile the afterglow is fading. The mountains
are yet clothed in an atmosphere of tender half-light;
but mysterious shadows are fast creeping over the plain,
and the mounds of the ancient city lie at our feet, confused
and tumbled, like the waves of a dark sea. How high
it is here—how lonely—how silent! Hark that thin
plaintive cry! It is the wail of a night-wandering
jackal. See how dark it is yonder, in the direction of
the river! Quick, quick! We have lingered too long.
We must begone at once; for we are already benighted.
