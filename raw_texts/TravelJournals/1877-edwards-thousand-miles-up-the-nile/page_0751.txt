deacon retired. The priest then came forward and
made a sign to the school children, who ran up noisily
from all parts of the church, and joined with the chor-
isters in a wild kind of chant. It seemed to us that this
chant concluded the ﬁrst part of the service.

The second part closely resembled the celebration
of mass. The priest came to the door of the screen;
looked at the congregation; folded his hands palm to
palm; went up to the threshold of the apse, and began
reciting what sounded like a litany. He then uncovered
the sacred vessels, which till now had been concealed
under two blue cotton handkerchiefs, and, turning, shook
the handkerchiefs towards the people. He then con-
secrated the wine and wafer; elevated the host; and
himself partook of the Eucharist in both elements. A
little bell was rung during the consecration and again
at the elevation. The people, meanwhile, stood very
reverently, with their heads bent; but no one knelt
during any part of the service. After this, the ofﬁciating
priest washed his hands in a brass basin; and the
deacon—who was also the schoolmaster—came round
the church holding up his scarf, which was heaped full
of little cakes of unleavened bread. These he distri-
buted to all present. An acolyte followed with a plate,
and collected the offerings of the congregation.

We now thought the service was over; but there
remained four wee, crumpled, brown mites of babies
