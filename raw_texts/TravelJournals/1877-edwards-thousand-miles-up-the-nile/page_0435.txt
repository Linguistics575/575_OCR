small shaggy sheep that had been brought down to the
landing-place for sale. But for the breeze that happened
just then to be blowing, we should have liked to climb
the rock, and see the view and the ruins—which are part
modern, part Turkish, part Roman, and little, if at all,
Egyptian.

There are also some sculptured and painted grottoes
to be seen in the southern face of the mountain. They
are, however, too difﬁcult of access to be attempted by
ladies. Alfred, who went ashore after quail, was drawn
up to them by r0pes; but found them so much defaced as
to be scarcely worth the trouble.

We were now only thirty-four miles from Aboo
Simbel; but making slow progress, and impatiently
counting every foot of the way. The heat at times was
great; frequent and ﬁtful spells of Khamseen wind alter-
nating with a hot calm that tried the trackers sorely.
Still we pushed forward, a few miles at a time; till by
and by the ﬂat-topped cliffs dropped out of sight and
were again succeeded by volcanic peaks, some of which
looked loftier than any of those about Dakkeh or
Korosko. '

Then the palms ceased, and the belt of cultivated
land narrowed to a thread of green between the rocks
and the river; and at last there came an evening when
we only wanted breeze enough to double two or three
more bends in the river.
