His name was Hassan Ebn Rashwan el Kashef, and he
was a grandson of that same old Hassan Kashef who
was vice-regent of Nubia in the days of Burckhardt and
Belzoni. He received our Happy Couple with dis-
tinguished hospitality, killed a sheep in their honour,
and entertained them for more than three hours. The
meal consisted of an endless succession of dishes, all of
which, like that bugbear of our childhood, the hated Air
with Variations, went on repeating the same theme
under a multitude of disguises ; and, whether roast,
boiled, stewed or minced, served on skewers, smothered
in rice, or drowned in sour milk, were always mutton au
fond.

We now despaired of ever seeing a crocodile; and but
for a trail that our men discovered on the island opposite,
we should almost have ceased to believe that there were
crocodiles in Egypt. The marks were quite fresh when
we went to look at them. The creature had been bask-
ing high and dry in the sun, and this was the point at
which he had gone down again to the river. The damp
sand at the water’s edge had taken the mould of his
huge ﬂeshy paws, and even of the jointed armour of his
tail, though this last impression was somewhat blurred
by the ﬁnal rush with which he had taken to the water.
I doubt if Robinson Crusoe, when he saw the famous
footprint on the shore, was more excited than we of the
l’hilae at sight of this genuine and undeniable trail.
