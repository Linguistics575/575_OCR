Egyptian art, have been too often engraved to need
description. The votive shrines of the Rameses family
are grouped all together in a picturesque nook green
with bushes to the water’s edge. There are three; the
work of Seti I., Rameses II., and Menephthah—lofty

sculptures of Silsilis there ﬁgure two deities but rarely

the province, and Hapi-mu, the lotus-

honour are found carved here and there
upon the rocks.1 Most curious of all,
however, is a Goddess named Ta-ur-t,”

of the shrine of Rameses II. This

a hippopotamus and the face of a woman, wears a tie-wig
and a robe of state with ﬁve capes, and looks like a cross
