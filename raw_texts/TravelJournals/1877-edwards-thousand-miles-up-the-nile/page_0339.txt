which it would hardly be an exaggeration to describe as
some hundreds in number, no two are alike. Some are
piled up like the rocks at the Lands End in Cornwall,
block upon block, column upon column, tower upon tower,
as if reared by the hand of man. Some are green with
grass; some golden with slopes of drifted sand; some
planted with rows of blossoming lupins, purple and white.
Others again are mere cairns of loose blocks, with here
and there a perilously balanced top-boulder. On one, a
singular upright monolith, like a menhir, stands conspicu-
ous, as if placed there to commemorate a date, or to point
the way to Philae. Another mass rises out of the water
squared and buttressed, in the likeness of a fort. A third,
humped and shining like the wet body of some amphibious
beast, lifts what seems to be a horned head above the
surface of the rapids. All these blocks and boulders and
fantastic rocks are granite ; some red, some purple, some
black. Their forms are rounded by the friction of ages.
Those nearest the brink reﬂect the sky like mirrors of
burnished steel. Royal ovals and hieroglyphed inscrip-
tions, fresh as of yesterday’s cutting, start out here and
there from those glittering surfaces with startling dis-
tinctness. A few of the larger islands are crowned with
clumps of palms; and one, the loveliest of any, is com-
pletely embowered in gum-trees and acacias, dom and
date palms, and feathery tamarisks, all festooned together
under a hanging canOpy of yellow-blossomed creepers.
