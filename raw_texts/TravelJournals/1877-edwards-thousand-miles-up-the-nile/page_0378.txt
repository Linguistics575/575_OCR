It seems possible, therefore, that at some period sub-

migrated from Abydos to Philae; in which case there
would have been a formal transfer not only of the relics
of Osiris, but of the sanctity which had attached for ages

such an exodus wanting. The ashes of the God were no
longer safe at Abydos. Situated in the midst of a rich
corn country on the high road to Thebes, no city south
of Memphis lay more exposed to the hazards of war.
Cambyses had already passed that way. Other invaders
might follow. To seek beyond the frontier that security
which might no longer be found in Egypt, would seem .

devoted to its trust. This, of course, is mere conjecture;
to be taken for what it may be worth. The decadence
of Abydos coincides, at all events, with the growth' of
Philae; and it is only by help of some such assumption
that one can understand how a new site should have

Greek and Roman rule. It was in the time of the
