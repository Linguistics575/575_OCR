crowned like Osiris, is worshipped by Seti I. Behind
Seti stands his Queen Tuaa, the mother of Rameses II.
Elsewhere Seti I., being now dead, is deiﬁed and wor-
shipped by Rameses II., who pours a libation to his
father’s statue. Through all these handsome heads
there runs a striking family likeness. All more or less
partake of that Dantesque type which characterises the
portraits of Rameses II. in his youth. The features of
Rameses I. and Seti I. are somewhat pinched and stern,
like the Dante of elder days. The delicate proﬁle of
Queen Tuaa, which is curiously like some portraits of
Queen Elizabeth, is perhaps too angular to be altogether
pleasing. But in the well‘known face of Rameses II.
these harsher details vanish, and the beauty of the race
culminates. The artists of Egyptian Renaissance,
always great in proﬁle-portraiture, are nowhere seen to
better advantage than in this interesting series.
Adjoining what may be called the monumental part

sense; neither was it canonisation in the modern sense. The
Egyptians believed the justiﬁed dead to be assimilated, or rather
identiﬁed, in the spirit with Osiris, the beneﬁcent Judge and Deity of
the lower world. Thus, in their worship of ancestry, they adored not
mortals immortalised, but the dead in Osiris, and Osiris in the dead.

It is worth noting, by the way, that notwithstanding the subsequent
deiﬁcation of Seti I., Rameses I. remained, so to say, the tutelary saint
of the Temple. He alone is represented with the curious pointed and
upturned beard, like a Chamois horn reversed, which is the peculiar
attribute of deity.
