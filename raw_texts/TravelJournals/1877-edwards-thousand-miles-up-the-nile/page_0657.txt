Hathor1 are interdependent; the one being strictly the
complement of the other. Thus in the inscriptions of
Edfoo we ﬁnd perpetual allusion to the cultus of Den—
derah, and vice versa. Both Edfoo and Denderah are
rich in inscriptions; but as the extent of wall-space is
greater at Edfoo, so is the literary wealth of this Temple
greater than the literary wealth of Denderah. It also
seemed to me that the surface was more closely ﬁlled in
at Edfoo than at Denderah. Every wall, every ceiling,
every pillar, every architrave, every passage and side-
chamber however dark, every staircase, every doorway,
the outer wall of the Temple, the inner side of the great
wall of circuit, the huge pylons from top to bottom, are
not only covered, but crowded, with ﬁgures and hiero-
glyphs. Among these we ﬁnd no enormous battle-
subjects as at Aboo Simbel—no heroic recitals, like the
poem of Pentaour. Those went out with the Pharaohs,
and were succeeded by tableaux of religious rites and
dialogues of gods and kings. Such are the stock

generations divines. Sous le nom de Haroéris il est né de Seb et Nout,
et par consequent frére d’Osiris, dont il est le ﬁls sons un autre nom.
. . . Horus, armé d’un dard avec lequel i1 transperce les ennemis
d’Osiris, est appelé Horus 1e Justicier."—Did. Arc/z. P. PIERRE'I‘,
article “ Horus.”

‘ Hat/102' :——“ Elle est, comme Neith, Maut, et Nout, la personniﬁ-
cation de l’espace dans lequel se meut 1e soleil, dont Horus symbolise
1e lever: aussi son nom, Hat-hor, signiﬁe—t-il litteralement, l’lzabilafion
d’Homs.”-—[bz}l., article “ Hat/tar."
