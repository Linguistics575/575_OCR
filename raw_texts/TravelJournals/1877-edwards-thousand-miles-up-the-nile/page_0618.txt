I vanquished them a second time ; and the ﬁrst time

I established myself completely with my troops.

I vanquished them, and they supplicated me.

I made peace with them; and they swore to me by their idols.

I trusted them ; because they are a peOple of good faith.

Then I returned to my dominions in the Upper Country.

For I am a king.

Not only am I no follower in the train of other kings,

But I go before them.

As for those who seek strife against me,

I give them no peace in their homes till they entreat my pardon.

For I am a lion on the plains, and a goat upon the mountains.
etc. etc. etc.

The historical value of this inscription is very great.
It shows that in the sixth century, while the native
inhabitants of this part of the Valley of the Nile yet
adhered to the ancient Egyptian faith, the Ethiopians of
the south were professedly Christian.

The descendants of the Blemmys are a ﬁne race ; tall,
strong, and of a rich chocolate complexion. 'Strolling
through the village at sunset, we see the entire pOpulation
——old men sitting at their doors ; young men lounging and
smoking; children at play. The women, with glittering
white teeth and liquid eyes, and a profusion of gold and

posed to be originally of the tribe of Bilmas of Tibbous in the central
desert, and settled as early as the time of Eratosthenes in that part of the
Valley of the Nile which lies between the First and Second Cataracts.
