As for the Temple of Goornah, it is, at least in part,
as distinctly a memorial ediﬁce as the Medici Chapel at
Florence or the Su'perga at Turin. -It was begun by
Seti I. in memory of his father Rameses I., the founder
of the XIXth Dynasty. Seti, however, died before the
work was completed. Hereupon Rameses I 1., his son
and' successor, extended the general plan, ﬁnished the
part dedicated to his grandfather, and added sculptures
to the memory of Seti I. Later still, Menepthah, the
son and successor of Rameses 11., left his cartouches
upon one of the doorways. The whole building, in
short, is a family monument, and contains a family por-
trait 1 gallery. Here all the personages whose names
ﬁgure in the shrines of the Ramessides at Silsilis are
depicted in their proper persons. In one tableau,
Rameses I., defunct, deiﬁed,l swathed, enshrined, and

travelled thither on this errand, we ﬁnd Strabo, Germanicus, Hadrian,
and the Empress Sabina. Opinion is divided as to the cause of this
sound. There is undoubtedly a hollow space inside the throne of this
statue, as may be seen by all who examine it from behind ; and Sir G.
Wilkinson, in expressing his conviction that the musical sound was a piece
of priestly jugglery, represents the opinion of the majority. The author
of a carefully considered article in the Quarterly Review, N o. 276, April
187 5, coincides with Sir D. Brewster in attributing the sound to a trans-
mission of rareﬁed air through the crevices of the stone, caused by the
sudden change of temperature consequent on the rising of the sun. The
statue, which, like its companion, was originally one solid monolith of grit-
stone, was repaired with sandstone during the reign of Septimius Severus.
