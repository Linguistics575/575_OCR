utterances here ascribed to the King and the Gods a
reﬂection of that contemporary worship of the Beautiful,
the Good, and the True, which characterised the teaching
of the Alexandrian Museum.*

Passing on from the portico to the Hall of Assembly,
we enter a region of still dimmer twilight, beyond which
all is dark. In the side-chambers, where the heat is
intense and the atmosphere stiﬂing, we can see only by
the help of lighted candles. These rooms are about
twenty feet in length; separate like prison cells; and

* Hathor (or more correctly Hat-hor, 125., the abode of Horus),
is not merely the Aphrodite of ancient Egypt: she is the pupil
of the eye of the Sun; she is the goddess of that beneﬁcent planet
whose rising heralds the waters of the inundation; she represents
the eternal youth of nature, and is the direct personiﬁcation of the
Beautiful. She is also Goddess of Truth. “ I offer the Truth to thee,
0 Goddess of Denderah 1” says the King, in one of the inscrip-
tions of the sanctuary of the Sistrum ; “for truth is thy work, and
thou thyself art Truth.” Lastly, her emblem is the Sistrum, and the
sound of the Sistrum, according to Plutarch, was supposed to terrify
and expel Typhon (the evil principle); just as in mediaeval times the
ringing of church-bells was supposed to scare Beelzebub and his crew.
From this point of view, the Sistrum becomes typical of the triumph of
Good over Evil. M. Mariette, in his analysis of the decorations and
inscriptions of this temple, points out how the builders were inﬂuenced
by the prevailing philosophy of the age, and how they veiled the
Platonism of Alexandria beneath the symbolism of the ancient religion.
The Hat-hor of Denderah was in fact worshipped in a sense unknown
to the Egyptians of pre—Ptolemaic times.
