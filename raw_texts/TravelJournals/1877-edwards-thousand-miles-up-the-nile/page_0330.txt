sea? The great stone may be older than Rameses the
Great, or as modern as the last of the Romans; but to
give it a date, or to divine its history, is impossible.
Egyptology, which has solved the enigma of the Sphinx,
is powerless here. The obelisk of the quarry holds its
secret safe, and holds it for ever.

Ancient Egyptian quarrying is seen under its most
striking aspect among extensive limestone or sandstone
ranges, as at Toora and Silsilis; but the process by
which the stone was extracted can nowhere be more
distinctly traced than at Assouan. In some respects,
indeed, the quarries here, though on a smaller scale than
those lower down the river, are even more interesting.
Nothing surprises one at Silsilis, for instance, more than
the economy with which the sandstone has been cut
from the heart of the mountain; but at Assouan, as the
material was more precious, so does the economy seem
to have been still greater. At Silsilis, the yellow cliffs
have been sliced as neatly as the cheeses in a cheese-
monger’s window. Smooth, upright walls alone mark
the place where the work has been done; and the
amount of débris is altogether insigniﬁcant. But at
Assouan, when extracting granite for sculptural purposes,
they attacked the form of the object required, and cut it
out roughly to shape. The great obelisk is but one of
many cases in point. In the same group of rocks, or
one very closely adjoining, we saw a rough-hewn column,
