hieroglyphic inscriptions becomes in Arabic Belak;1
which is much more like the original than the Philae
of the Greeks.

The native Christians, meanwhile, would seem to have
relapsed into a state of semi-barbarism. They make
perpetual inroads upon the Arab frontier, and suffer per-
petual defeat. Battles are fought; tribute is exacted;
treaties are made and broken. Towards the close of the
thirteenth century, their king being slain and their
churches plundered, they lose one fourth of their territory,
including all that part which borders upon Assouan. Those
who remain Christians are also condemned to pay an
annual capitation tax, in addition to the usual tribute of
dates, cotton, slaves, and camels. After this we may con-
clude that they accepted Islamism from the Arabs, as
they had accepted Osiris from the Egyptians and Christ
from the Romans. As Christians, at all events, we hear
of them no more; for Christianity in Nubia perished root

' These and the following particulars about the Christians of Nubia
are found in the famous work of Makrizi, an Arab historian of the
ﬁfteenth century, who quotes largely from earlier writers. See'Burck-
hardt’s T rave]: in Nubia, 4to, 1819, Appendix iii. Although Belak is
distinctly described as an island in the neighbourhood of the Cataract,
distant four miles from Assouan, Burckhardt persisted in looking for it
among the islets below Mahatta, and believed Philze to be the ﬁrst
Nubian town beyond the frontier. The hieroglyphic alphabet, however,
had not then been deciphered. Burckhardt died at Cairo in 1817,
and Champollion’s discovery was not given to the world till 1822.
