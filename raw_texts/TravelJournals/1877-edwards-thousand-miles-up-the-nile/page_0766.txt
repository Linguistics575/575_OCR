Now our path turns aside and we thread our way
among the houses, noticing here a sculptured block built
into a mud wall—yonder an alabaster sarcophagus broken
beside a dried-up well—farther on, a granite column still
erect, in the midst of a palm-garden. And now, the vil-
lage being left behind, we ﬁnd ourselves at the foot of a
great hill of newly excavated rubbish, from the top of
which we presently look down into a kind of crater, and
see the Great Temple of Abydus at our feet.

It was now nearly three o’clock; so, having seen what
we could in the time, and having before us a long ride
through a strange country, we left. again at six. I will
not presume to describe the Temples of Abydus——one of
which is so ruined as to be almost unintelligible, and the
other so singularly planned and so obscure in its general
purport, as to be a standing puzzle to archaeologists——
after a short visit of three hours. Enough if I sketch
brieﬂy what I saw but cursorily.

Buried as it is, Abydus,1 even under its mounds, is a
place of profound historical interest. At a time so remote
that it precedes all written record of Egyptian story,
there existed a little way to the northward of this site a

forcibly demonstrated the error of this calculation. He shows that the
pigeons do thirty million francs’ worth of damage to the crops in
excess of any beneﬁt they may confer upon the soil.

’ The Arabic name of the modern village, Arabat-el-Madfooneh,
means literally Arabat the Buried.
