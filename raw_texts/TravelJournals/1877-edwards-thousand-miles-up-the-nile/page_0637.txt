SILSIL IS AND EDFO 0.

GOING, it cost us four days to struggle up from
Assouan to Mahatta; returning, we slid down—thanks
to our old friend the Sheykh of the Cataract—in one
short, sensational half-hour. He came—ﬂat-faced, ﬁshy-
eyed, fatuous as ever—with his head tied up in the same
old yellow handkerchief, and with the same chibouque in
his mouth. He brought with him a following of ﬁfty
stalwart Shellalees; and under his arm he carried a
tattered red ﬂag. This ﬂag, on which were embroidered
the crescent and star, he hoisted with much solemnity at
the prow.

Consigned thus to the protection of the Prophet;
windows and tambooshyl shuttered up; doors closed;
breakables removed to a place of safety, and everything
made snug, as if for a storm at sea, we put off from
Mahatta at seven A.M. on a lovely morning in the middle
of March. The Philze, instead of threading her way
'back through the old channels, strikes across to the
Libyan side, making straight for the Big Bab—that for-
midable rapid which as yet we have not seen. All last

‘ Ar. Tan1booshy—i.c., saloon sky—light.
