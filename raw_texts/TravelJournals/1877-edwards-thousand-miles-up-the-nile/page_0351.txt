highest point to which it is ever known to attain at the
present day. ,I am not aware what relation the height
of this ancient bed bears to the levels recorded at Semneh,
or to those now annually self-registered upon the furrowed
banks of Philze; but one sees at a glance, without aid of
measurements or hydrographic science, that if the river
were to come down again next summer in a mighty ‘ bore,’
the crest of which rose 27 feet above the highest ground
now fertilised by the annual overﬂow, it would at once
reﬁll its long-deserted bed, and convert Assouan into an
island.

Granted, then, that the Nile ﬂowed through the desert
in the time of Amenemhat 111., there must at some later
period have come a day when it suddenly ran dry. This
catastrophe is supposed to have taken place about the
time of the expulsion of the Hyksos (circa B.C. 1703),
when a great disruption of the rocky barrier at Silsilis
is thought to have taken place ; so draining Nubia, which
till now had played the part of a vast reservoir, and dis-
persing the pent-up floods over the plains of Southern
Egypt. It would, however, be a mistake to conclude
that the Nile was by this catastrophe turned aside in
order to be precipitated in the direction of the Cataract.
One arm of the river must always have taken the present
lower and deeper course; while the other must of neces-
sity have run low—perhaps very nearly dry—as the
inundation subsided every spring.
