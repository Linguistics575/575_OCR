Says Thoth, Lord of Sesen]l resident in the midst
of Amenheri 2——I give thee a long time to rule over the
upper and lower country, Son. of my Race, Beloved
Rameses, Beloved of Amen, and to perform all thy
wishes. I give thee to celebrate the millions festivals
of thirty years3 of the king Ra-user-Ma, Approved of
the Sun, Rameses Beloved of Amen, as ruler of the
orbit of the Solar disk. The living, perfect God, giving
glory to his father Thoth, Lord of Sesen, Resident in
Amenheri, he made great and good monuments for
ever in face of the Horizon of Heaven.

The meaning of which is that Thoth, addressing
Rameses 11., then living and reigning, promises him
along life and many anniversaries of his jubilee, in
return for the works made in his (Thoth’s) honour at
Aboo Simbel and elsewhere.

M. Grebaut, in his translation of a hymn to Ammon Ra,,observes:
—“ Le soleil marchant d’Orient en Occident éclaire de ses deux yeux
les deux régions du Nord et du Midi.”-Rém¢e Arc/z. vol. xxv. 1873 ;
p. 387.
