curious baskets, and all such articles of personal luxury
as a palace-building Pharaoh might delight in. Here
also are the two famous harpers; cruelly defaced, but
still sweeping the strings with the old powerful touch
that erewhile soothed the King in his hours of melan-
choly. These two spirited ﬁgures—which are un-
doubtedly portraits 1——almost redeem the poverty of the
rest of the paintings.

In many tombs, the empty sarcophagus yet occupies
its ancient place.2 We saw one in No. 2 (Rameses IV.),
and another in No. 9 (Rameses VI.); the ﬁrst, a grand
monolith of dark granite, overturned and but little in-

jured ; the second, shattered by early treasure-seekers.

‘ When first seen by Sir G. Wilkinson, these harpers were still in
such good preservation, that he reported of one at least, if not both,
as obviously blind. The harps are magniﬁcent, richly inlaid and gilded,
and adorned with busts of the king. One has eleven strings, the
other fourteen.

’ The sarc0phagus of Seti I., which was brought to England by
Belzoni, is in Sir J. Soane’s Museum. It is carved from a single block
of the ﬁnest alabaster, and is covered with incised hieroglyphic texts
and several hundred ﬁgures, descriptive of the passage of the sun
through the hours of the night. See Le Sarcop/zage de 5612' 1. P.
PIERRET. Révue Arch, vol. xxi. p. 285 : 1870.

The sarc0phagus of Rameses III. is in the Fitz-William Museum,
Cambridge, and the lid thereof is in the Egyptian collection of the
Louvre. See Remarks on the Sarcop/zagus qf Rameses [I]. S. BIRCH,
LL. D. 3 Cambridge, 1876. Also Notice Sommaz're dc: xlformmmt:
