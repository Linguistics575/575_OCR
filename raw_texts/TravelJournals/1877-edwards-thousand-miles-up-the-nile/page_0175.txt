undermined by water-washed caverns in which lurk a
few lingering crocodiles. If at Gebel-et-Tayr the rock
is worn into semblances of Arabesque ornamentation,
here it looks as if inscribed all over with mysterious
records in characters not unlike the Hebrew. Records
they are, too, of pre-historic days—chronicles of his own

written has never been spoken by man.

As for the rock-cut tombs of Gebel Aboofayda, they
must number many hundreds. For nearly twelve miles
the range runs parallel to the river, and throughout that
distance the face of the cliffs is pierced with innumerable
doorways. Some are small and square, twenty or thirty
