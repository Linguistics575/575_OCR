the dust, their gold and silver ornaments, and the trea-
sures of their tombs, all stolen. In another instance, a
king and his queen were carried away bodily, to be

of the Amenophium, discovered the remains of the tomb of this very
king, and the broken stela bearing upon its face a full-length basrelief of
King En-Aa (or Entef-Aa), with three dogs before him and one between
his legs; the dog Bahuka having his name engraved over his back in
