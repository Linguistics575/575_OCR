even here, every accessible human face, however small,
has been laboriously mutilated.

Bewildered at ﬁrst sight of these profuse and mys-
terious decorations, we wander round and round; going
on from the ﬁrst hall to the second, from the second to the
third; and plunging into deeper darkness at every step.
We have been reading about these gods and emblems
for weeks past—we have studied the plan of the Temple
beforehand; yet now that we are actually here, our book-
knowledge goes for nothing, and we feel as hopelessly
ignorant as if we had been suddenly landed in a new
world. Not till we have got over this ﬁrst feeling of
confusion—not till, resting awhile on the base of one of
the columns, we re-read M. Mariette’s exposition of the
plan of the building and the character of the ceremonies
intended to be performed within its walls, do we begin
to realise the purport of the sculptures by which we are
surrounded.

The ceremonial of Egyptian worship was essentially
processional. Herein we have the central idea of every
Temple, and the key to its construction. It was bound
' to contain store-chambers in which were kept vestments,
instruments, divine emblems, and the like; laboratories
for the preparation of perfumes and unguents; treasuries
for the safe custody of holy vessels and precious offerings;
chambers for the reception and puriﬁcation of tribute in
kind; halls for the assembling and marshalling of priests
