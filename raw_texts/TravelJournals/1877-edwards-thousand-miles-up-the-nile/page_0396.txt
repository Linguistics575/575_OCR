tion of pilgrims in all ages. Kings, conquerors, priests,
travellers, have covered it with records of victories, of
religious festivals, of prayers, and offerings, and acts of
adoration. Some of these are older by a thousand years
and more than the temples on the island opposite.

Such, roughly summed up, are the fourfold surround-
ings of Philae—the cataract, the river, the desert, the
environing mountains. The Holy Island—beautiful,
lifeless, a thing of the far past, with all its wealth of
sculpture, painting, history, poetry, tradition—sleeps, or
seems to sleep, in the midst.

It is one of the world's famous landscapes, and it ‘

deserves its fame. Every sketcher sketches it; every
traveller describes it. Yet it is just one of those places
of which the objective and subjective features are so
equally balanced that it bears putting neither into words
nor colours. The sketcher must perforce leave out the
atmosphere of association that informs his subject; and
the writer’s description is at best no better than a
catalogue raisonnée.
