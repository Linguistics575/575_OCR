Side by- side with the work of production goes on the
work of excavation. The professed diggers colonise the
western bank. They live rent-free among the tombs;
drive donkeys or work shadoofs by day, and spend their
nights searching for treasure. Some hundreds of families
live in this grim way, spoiling the dead and gone
Egyptians for a livelihood.

Forgers, diggers, and dealers play, meanwhile, into
one another's hands, and drive a roaring trade. Your
Dahabeeyah, as I have just shown, is beset from the
moment you moor till the moment you pole off again
from shore. The boy who drives your donkey, the guide
who pilots you among the tombs, the half-naked Fellah
who ﬂings down his hoe as you pass, and runs beside you
for a mile across the plain, have one and all an “ antichi ”
to dispose of. The turbaned ofﬁcial who comes, attended
by his secretary and pipe-bearer, to pay you a visit of
ceremony, warns you against imposition and hints at
genuine treasures, to which he alone possesses the key.
The gentlemanly native who sits next to you at dinner
has a wonderful scarab in his pocket. In short, every
man, woman, and child about the place is bent on selling
a bargain; and the bargain, in ninety-nine cases out of
a hundred, is valuable in so far as it represents the
industry of Luxor—nbut no farther. A good thing, of
course, is to be had occasionally; but the good thing

never comes to the surface as long as a market can
