all alike bound for Esneh, which is a large trading town,
and lies twenty-six miles South of Erment.

Now at Esneh the men were to bake again. Great,
therefore, was Re'is Hassan’s anxiety to get in ﬁrst,
secure the oven, and buy the ﬂour before dusk. The Rel's
of the ‘ F ostat’ and he of the ‘Bagstones’ were equally
anxious, and for the same reasons. Our men, mean-
while, were wild with excitement, watching every
manoeuvre of the other boats; hanging on to the sho-
ghool like a swarm of bees; and obeying the word of
command with unwonted alacrity.‘ As we neared the
goal, the race grew hotter. The honour of the boats
was at stake, and the bread question was for the moment
forgotten. Finally all three Dahabeeyahs ran in abreast,
and moored side by side in front of a row of little open
cafés just outside the town.

Esneh (of which the old Egyptian civil name was Sni,
and the Roman name Latopolis) stands high upon the
mounds of the ancient city. It is a large place—as
large, apparently, as Minieh; and, like Minieh, is the
capital of a province. Here dragomans lay in provision
of limes, charcoal, ﬂour, and live stock, for the Nubian
journey; and crews bake for the last time before their
return to Egypt. For in Nubia food is scarce, and
prices are high, and there are no public ovens.

It was about ﬁve o’clock on a market-day when we
reached Esneh, and the market was not yet over.
