of crocodiles! He went serene and smiling, with his
gun under his arm, and Mehemet Ali in his wake.
Who so light of heart as that Idle Man P Who so light
of heel as that turbaned retriever? We heard our
sportsman popping away presently in the barley. It
was a pleasant sound, for we knew his aim was true.
“Every shot,” said we, “means a bird.” We little
dreamed that one of those shots meant a baby.

All at once, a woman screamed. It was a sharp,
sudden scream, following a shot—a scream with a ring
of horror in it. Instantly it was caught up from point to
point, growing in volume and seeming to be echoed from
every direction at once. At the same moment, the bank
became alive with human beings. They seemed to
spring from the soil—women shrieking and waving their
arms; men running; all making for the same goal.
The Writer heard the scream, saw the rush, and knew
at once that a gun accident had happened.

A few minutes of painful suspense followed. Then
Mehemet Ali appeared, tearing back at the top of his
speed ; and presently—perhaps ﬁve minutes later,
though it seemed like twenty-——came the Idle Man; walk-
. ing very slowly and deﬁantly, with his head up, his arms
folded, his gun gone, and an immense rabble at his heels.

Our scanty crew, armed with sticks, ﬂew at once to
the rescue, and brought him off in safety. We then
learned what had happened.
