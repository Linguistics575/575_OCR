approach Minieh ; and such is the sunset we are destined
to see with scarcely a shade of difference at the same
hour and under precisely the same conditions for many
a month to come. It is very beautiful, very tranquil,
full of wonderful light and most subtle gradations of
tone, and attended by certain phenomena of which I
shall have more to say presently ; but it lacks the variety
and gorgeousness of our northern skies. Nor, given
the dry atmosphere of Egypt, can it be otherwise. Those
who go up the Nile expecting, as I did, to see mag-
niﬁcent Turneresque pageants of purple, and ﬂame-
colour, and gold, will be disappointed as I was. For
your Turneresque pageant cannot be achieved without
such accessories of cloud and vapour as in Nubia are
wholly unknown, and in Egypt are of the rarest occur-
rence. Once, and only once, in the course of an
unusually protracted sojourn on the river, had we the
good fortune to witness a grand display of the kind;
and then we had been nearly three months in the
Dahabeeyah.

Meanwhile, however, we never weary of these stain-
less skies, but ﬁnd in them, evening after evening, fresh
depths of beauty and repose. As for that strange
transfer of colour from the mountains to the sky, we had
repeatedly observed it while travelling in the Dolomites
the year before, and had always found it take place,

as now, at the moment of the sun’s ﬁrst disappearance.
