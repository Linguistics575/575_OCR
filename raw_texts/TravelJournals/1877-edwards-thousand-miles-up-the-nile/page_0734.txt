thought he should rise as from sleep; cast off his
bandages; eat and be refreshed, and put on sandals and
scented vestments, and take his staff in his hand, and go
forth again into the light of everlasting day. Poor
ghost, wandering bodiless through space! where now are
thy funeral-baked meats, thy changes of raiment, thy
perfumes and precious ointments? Where is that body
for which thou wert once so solicitous, and without
which resurrectionl is impossible? One fancies thee
sighing forlorn through these desolate halls when all is
silent and the moon shines down the valley.

Life at Thebes is made up of incongruities. A
morning among temples is followed by an afternoon of
antiquity-hunting; and a day of meditation among
tombs winds up with a dinner-party on board some
friends Dahabeeyah, ora fantasia at the British Consulate.
L. and the Writer did their fair share of antiquity-

1 Impossible from the Egyptian point of view. “That the body
should not waste or decay was an object of anxious solicitude; and
for this purpose various bandlets and amulets, prepared with certain
magical preparations, and sanctiﬁed with certain spells or prayers, or
even offerings and small sacriﬁces, were distributed over various parts
of the mummy. In some mysterious manner the immortality of the
body was deemed as important as the passage of the soul; and at a
later period the growth or natural reparation of the body was invoked
as earnestly as the life or passage of the soul to the upper regions.”—
