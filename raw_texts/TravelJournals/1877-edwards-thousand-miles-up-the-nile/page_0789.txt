the Great Vestibule,l one is surrounded by a host of these
extraordinary ﬁgures, erect; coloured; clothed; all but
in motion. It is like entering the crowded anteroom
of a royal palace in the time of the Ancient Empire.

The greater number of the Boulak portrait-statues are
sculptured in what is called the hieratic attitude; that is,
with the left arm down and pressed close to the body,
the left hand holding a roll of papyrus, the right leg
advanced, and the right hand raised, as grasping the
walking staff. It occurred to me that there might be a
deeper signiﬁcance than at ﬁrst sight appears in this
conventional attitude, and that it perhaps suggests the
moment of resurrection, when the deceased, holding fast
by his copy of the Book of the Dead, walks forth from
his tomb into the light of life eternal.

Of all the statues here—one may say, indeed, of all
known Egyptian statues—those of Prince Ra-hotep and
Princess N efer—t are the most wonderful. They are the
oldest statues in the world.2 They come from a tomb of
the Third Dynasty, and are contemporary with Snefru,3
a king who reigned before the time of Cheops and

1 It is in the Great Vestibule that we ﬁnd the statue of Ti. See
Chap. IV., p. 92.

’ There is no evidence to show that the statues of Sepa and Nesa
in the Louvre are older than the IVth Dynasty.

3 Snefru is believed to be the builder of the pyramid of Meydoom,
which has never yet been opened, and which probably contains his
mummy.
