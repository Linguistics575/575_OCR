The Sesostris of Diodorus Siculus went blind, and
died by his own hand; which act, says the historian, as
it conformed to the glory of his life, was greatly admired
by his people. We are here evidently in the region of
pure fable. Suicide was by no means an Egyptian, but
a classical virtue. Just as the Greeks hated age, the
Egyptians reverenced it; and it may be doubted whether
a people who seem always to have passionately desired
length of days, would have seen anything to admire in a
wilful shortening of that most precious gift of the gods.
.With the one exception of Cleopatra—the death of
Nitocris the rosy-checked being also of Greek,1 and
therefore questionable, origin—no Egyptian soVereign is

known to have committed suicide; and even Cleopatra,
who was half Greek by birth, must have been inﬂuenced

to the act by Greek and Roman example. Dismissing,
then, altogether this legend of his blindness and self-

as to the age of Moses at the Exodus, twice over forty years.” Forty
years is the mode of expressing a generation, from thirty to thirty-three
years. £92pr Place in Universal Elston: BUNSEN. Lond. 18 59. Vol.
iii. p. 184. That Menephthah did not himself perish with his host,
seems certain. The ﬁnal Oppression of the Hebrews and the miracles
of Moses, as narrated in the Bible, give one the impression of having
all happened within a comparatively short space of time; and cannot
have extended over a period of twenty years. Neither is it stated that
Pharaoh perished. The tomb of Menephthah, in fact, is found in the
Valley of the Tombs of the Kings (Tomb, No. 8).
