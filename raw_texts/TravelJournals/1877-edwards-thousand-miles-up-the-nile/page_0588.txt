a palm-staff in his hand, he stands before us the living
double of the famous wooden statue at Boulak. He is
followed by his two wives and three or four children, all
bent upon trade. The women have trinkets, the boys a
live chameleon and a small stuffed crocodile for sale.
While the Painter is bargaining for the crocodile and
L. for a nose-ring, the Writer makes acquaintance with a
pair of self-important hoopoes, who live in the pylon, and
evidently regard it as a big nest of their own building.
They sit observing me curiously while I sketch, nodding
their crested polls and chattering disparagingly, like a
couple of critics. By and by comes a small black bird
with a white breast, and sings deliciously. It is like no
little bird that I have ever seen before; but the song
that it pours so lavishly from its tiny throat is as sweet
and brilliant as a canary’s.

Powerless against the wind, the Dahabeeyah lies idle
day after day in the sun. Sometimes, when we chance
to be near a village, the natives squat on the bank, and
stare at us for hours together. The moment any one
appears on deck, they burst into a chorus of “Back-
sheesh ! ” There is but one way to get rid of them, and

chambers were accessible till three or four years ago, when a party
of German travellers carried off some sculptured tablets of great
archaeological interest; since when the entrance has been sanded up
by order of Mariette Bey. See also, with regard to the probable date
of the earthquake at this place, chap. xviii. p. 512.
