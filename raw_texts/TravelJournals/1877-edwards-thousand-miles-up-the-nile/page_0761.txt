edge, now lie far back on the top of a steep brown ridge,
at the foot of which stretches a moist ﬂat planted with
water-melons. Each melon-plant is protected from the
sun by a tiny gable-roof of palm-thatch.

Meanwhile, the river being low and the banks high,
we unfortunates beneﬁt scarcely at all by the faint
breezes that now and then rufﬂe the barley. Day by
day the thermometer (which hangs in the coolest corner
of the saloon) creeps up higher and higher, working its
way by degrees to above 99°; but never succeeding in
- getting up quite to 100°. We, however, living in semi-
darkness, with closed jalousies, and wet sails hung round
the sides of the Dahabeeyah, and wet towels hung up in
our cabins, ﬁnd 99° quite warm enough to be pleasant.
The upper deck is of course well deluged several times a
day; but even so, it is difﬁcult to keep the timbers from
starting. Meanwhile L. and. the Idle Man devote their
leisure to killing ﬂies, keeping the towels wet, and
sprinkling the ﬂoors.

Our progress all this time is of the slowest. The
men cannot row by day; and at night the sandbanks so
hedge us in with dangers, that the only possible way by
which we can make a few miles between sunset and
sunrise is by sheer hard punting. Now and then we
come to a clear channel, and sometimes we get an hour
or two of sweet south breeze; but these ﬂashes of good
luck are few and far between.
