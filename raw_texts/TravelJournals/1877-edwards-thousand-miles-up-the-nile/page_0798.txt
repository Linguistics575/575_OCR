the sand close by marks the site of that strange monu-
ment miscalled the Temple of the Sphinx.1 Farther
away to the west, on the highest slope of this part of
the desert platform, stands the Pyramid of Mycerinus.
It has lost but ﬁve feet of its original height, and from
this distance it looks quite perfect.

Such—set in a waste of desert—are the main
objects, and the nearest objects, on which our eyes ﬁrst
rest. As a whole, the view is more long than wide,

the answer would be, Because Horus, avenger of Osiris, looks to the
East, awaiting the return of his father from the lower world. As
Horus was supposed to have reigned over Egypt, every Pharaoh took
the title of Living Horus, Golden Hawk, etc. etc. Hence the features
of the reigning King were always given to the Sphinx form when
architecturally employed, as at Karnak, Wady Sabooah, Tanis, etc. etc.

‘ It is certainly not a Temple. It may be a mastaba, or votive
chapel. It looks most like a tomb. It is entirely built of plain and
highly—polished monoliths of alabaster and red granite, laid square and
simply, like a sort of costly and magniﬁcent Stonehenge ; and it consists
of a forecourt, a hall of pillars, three principal chambers, some smaller
chambers, a secret recess, and a well. The chambers contain hori-
zontal niches which it is difﬁcult to suppose could have been intended
for anything but the reception of mummies ; and at the bottom of the
well were found three statues of King Shafra (Chephren) ; one of which
is the famous diorite portrait-statue of the Boulak Museum. In an
interesting article contributed to the Révue Arr/z : (Vol. xxvi. Paris:
1873), M. du Barry-Merval has shown, as it seems, quite clearly, that
the Temple of the Sphinx is in fact the votive chapel of Chephren,
and a dependency of the Second Pyramid. It is possible that the
niches may have been designed for his Queen and family.
