One of the most interesting incidents connected with
the excavation of this little adytum remains yet to be told.

I have described the female ﬁgure at the upper end
of the north wall, and how she holds in her right hand
the crux ansata and in her left the jackal-headed sceptre.
The hand that holds the crux hangs by her side; the
hand that holds the sceptre is half raised. Close under
this upraised hand, at a height of between three and four
feet from the actual level of the ﬂoor, there were visible
upon the uncoloured surface of the original stucco several
lines of free-hand writing. This writing was laid on,
apparently, with the brush, and the ink, if ever it had
been black, had now become brown. Five long lines
and three shorter lines were uninjured. Below these
were traces of other fragmentary lines, almost obliterated
by the sand.

We l-tnew at once that this quaint faint writing must
be in either the hieratic or demotic hand. We could
distinguish, or thought we could distinguish, in it vague
outlines of forms already familiar to us in the hieroglyphs
——abstracts, as it were, of birds and snakes and boats.
There could be no doubt, at all events, that the thing was
curious; and we set it down in our own minds as the
writing of either the architect or decorator of the place.

Anxious to make, if possible, an exact facsimile of
this inscription, the Writer copied it three times. The

last and best of these copies is here reproduced in photo-
