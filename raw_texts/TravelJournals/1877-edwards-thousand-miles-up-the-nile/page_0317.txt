build a palace and barracks when Champollion went up
in 1829. A ruined gateway of the Ptolemaic period
and a forlorn-looking sitting statue of Menephtah, the
Pharaoh of the Exodus, alone remain to identify the sites
on which they stood.

Thick palm-groves and carefully-tilled, patches of
castor—oil and cotton plants, lentils and dourra, make
green the heart of the island. The western shore is
wooded to the water’s edge. One may walk here in the
shade at hottest noon, listening to the murmur of the
Cataract-and seeking for wild ﬂowers—which, however,
would seem to blossom nowhere save in the sweet
Arabic name of Gezeeret-el-Zahr, the Island of Flowers.

Upon the high ground at the Southern extremity of
the island, among rubbish heaps, and bleached bones,
and human skulls, and the sloughed skins of snakes, and
piles of particoloured potsherds, we picked up several
bits of inscribed terra-cotta—evidently fragments of
broken vases. The writing was very faint, and in part
obliterated. We could see that the characters were
Greek; but not even our Idle Man was equal to making
'out a word of the sense. Believing them to be mere
disconnected scraps to which it would be impossible to
ﬁnd the corresponding pieces, taking it for granted,
also, that they were of comparatively modern date, we
brought away some three or four as souvenirs of the
place, and thought no more about them.
