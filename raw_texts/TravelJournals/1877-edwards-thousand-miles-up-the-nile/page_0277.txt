have needed a diving helmet to preserve eyes and ears
from destruction.

Towards afternoon, the fury of the wind so far
subsided that we were able to cross the river and ride to
Medinet Haboot and the Ramesseum. As we achieved
only a passing glimpse of these wonderful ruins, I will for
the present say nothing about them. We came to know
them so well hereafter that no mere ﬁrst impression
would be worth record.

A light but ﬁtful breeze helped us on next day as far
as Erment, the Ptolemaic Hermonthis; once the site of
a goodly temple, now of an important sugar-factory.
Here we moored for the night, and after dinner received
a visit of ceremony from the Bey—a tall, slender, sharp-
featured, bright-eyed man in European dress, remarkably
digniﬁed and well bred——who came attended by his
secretary, Kawass, and pipe-bearer. Now the Bey of
Erment is a great personage in these parts. He is
governor of the town as well as superintendent of the
sugar-factory; holds a military command; has his palace
and gardens close by, and his private steamer on the
river; and is, like most high ofﬁcials in Egypt, a Turk of
distinction. The secretary, who was the Bey’s younger
brother, wore a brown Inverness cape over a long white
petticoat, and left his slippers at the saloon door. He
sat all the time with his toes curiously doubled under, so
that his feet looked like clenched ﬁsts in stockings.
