before them. Yonder they walk out together and look
on while the farm-servants are at work, and watch the
coming in of the boats that bring home the produce of
Ti’s more distant lands. Here the geese are being
driven home; the cows are crossing a ford ; the oxen are
ploughing; the sower is scattering his seed; the reaper
plies his sickle; the oxen tread the grain; the corn is
stored away in the granary. There are evidently no
independent tradesfolk in these early days of the world.
Ti has his own artiﬁcers on his own estate, and all his
goods and chattels are home-made. Here the carpenters
are fashioning new furniture for the house; the ship-
wrights are busy on new boats; the potters mould pots;
the metal-workers smelt ingots of red gold. It is plain to
see that Ti lived like a king within his own boundaries.
He makes an imposing ﬁgure, too, in all these scenes,
and, being represented about eight times as large as his
servants, sits and stands a giant among pigmies. His
wife (we must not forget that she was of the blood royal)
is as big as himself; and the children are depicted
about half the size of their parents. Curiously enough,
Egyptian art never outgrew this early naiveté. The
great man remained a big man to the last days of the
Ptole’mies, and the fellah was always a dwarf.

Apart from these and one or two other mannerisms,
nothing can be more natural than the drawing, or more
spirited than the action, of all these men and animals.
