descent of the Cataract, foregoes a very curious sight,
and a very exciting adventure.

At Assouan we bade farewell to Nubia and the
blameless Ethi0pians, and found ourselves once more
traversing the Nile of Egypt. If instead of ﬁve miles
of Cataract we had crossed ﬁve hundred miles of sea or
desert, the change could not have been more complete.
We left behind us a dreamy river, a silent shore, an
ever-present desert. Returning, we plunged back at
once into the midst of a fertile and populous region.
All day long, now, we see boats on the river; villages
on the banks; birds on the wing; husbandmen on the
land; men and women, horses, camels and asses, passing
perpetually to and fro on the towing-path. There is
always something moving, something doing. The Nile
is running low, and the shadoofs—three deep, now—~—
are in full swing from morning till night. Again the
smoke goes up from clusters of unseen huts at close of
day. Again we hear the dogs barking from hamlet to
hamlet in the still hours of the night. Again, towards
sunset, we see troops of girls coming down to the river-
side with their water—jars on their heads. Those Arab
maidens, when they stand with garments tightly tucked
up and just their feet in the water, dipping the goollah
at arm’s length in the fresher gush of the current,
almost tempt one’s pencil into the forbidden paths of

caricature.
