The ride, nevertheless, has its advantages; not the
least being that it enables one to realise the kind of work
involved in any of the regular desert expeditions. At
all events, it entitles one to claim acquaintance with the
ship of the desert, and (bearing in mind the probable
inferiority of the specimen) to form an expede judgment
of his qualiﬁcations.

The camel has his virtues—so much at least must be
admitted; but they do not lie upon the surface. My
Buffon tells me, for instance, that he carries a fresh-water
cistern in his stomach; which is meritorious. But the
cistern ameliorates neither his gait nor his temper—
which are abominable. Irreproachable as a beast of
burden, he is open to many objections as a steed. It is
unpleasant, in the ﬁrst place, to ride an animal that not
only objects to being ridden, but cherishes a strong
personal antipathy to his rider. Such, however, is his
amiable peculiarity. You know that he hates you, from
the moment you ﬁrst walk round him, wondering where
and how to begin the ascent of his hump. He does not,
in fact, hesitate to tell you so in the roundest terms.
He swears freely while you are taking your seat; snarls
if you but move in the saddle; and stares you angrily in
the face, if you attempt to turn his head in any direction
save that which he himself prefers. Should you perse-
vere, he tries to bite your feet. If biting your feet does
not answer, he lies down.
