within three or four miles of Denderah. Abydos comes
ﬁrst in order according to the map; but then the
Temples lie seven or eight miles from the river, and as
we happened just thereabouts to be making some ten
miles an hour, we put off the excursion till our return.
Here, however, the ruins lay comparatively near at hand;
and in such a position that we could approach them from
below and rejoin our dahabeeyah a few miles higher up
the river. So, leaving Reis Hassan to track against the
current, we landed at the ﬁrst convenient point, and
ﬁnding neither donkeys nor guides at hand, took an
escort of three or four sailors, and set off on foot.

The way was long; the day was hot; and we had
only the map to go by. Having climbed the steep bank
and skirted an extensive palm-grove, we found ourselves
in a country without paths or roads of any kind. The
soil, squared off as usual like a gigantic chess-board, was
traversed by hundreds of tiny water-channels, between
which we had to steer our course as best we could.
Presently the last belt of palms was passed—the plain,
green with young corn and level as a lake, widened out
to the foot of the mountains—and the Temple, islanded
in that sea of rippling emerald, rose up before us upon its
platform of blackened mounds.

It was still full two miles away; but it looked enor-
mous—showing from this distance as a massive, low—
browed, sharply-deﬁned mass of dead-white masonry.
