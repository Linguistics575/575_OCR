and papyri, and wonders without end! That these
uncared-for bones should be laid in the mouth of such a
pit, scarcely occurred to us as an incongruity. Sup-
posing them to be Nubian remains, what then? If
a modern Nubian at the top, why not an ancient
Egyptian at the bottom ?

As the work of excavation went on, however, the
vault was found to be entered by a steep inclined plane.
Then the inclined plane turned out to be a ﬂight of
much worn and very shallow stairs. These led down to
a small square landing, some twelve feet below the
surface, from which landing an arched doorway1 and
passage opened into the fore-court of the Speos. Our
sailors had great difﬁculty in excavating this part, in
consequence of the weight of superincumbent sand and
debris on the side next the Speos. By shoring up the
ground, however, they were enabled completely to clear
the landing, which was curiously paved with cones of
rude pottery like the bottoms of amphorm. These
cones, of whichwe took out some twenty-eight or thirty,

were not in the least like the celebrated funereal cones

1 It was long believed that the Egyptians were ignorant of the
principle of the arch. This, however, was not the case. There are brick
arches of the time of Rameses II. behind the Ramesseum at Thebes,
and elsewhere. Still, arches are rare in Egypt. We ﬁlled in and
covered the arch again, and the greater part of the staircase, in order
to preserve the former.
