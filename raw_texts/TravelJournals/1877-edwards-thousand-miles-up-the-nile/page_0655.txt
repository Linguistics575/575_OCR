gigantic sculptures, tower higher and higher, and seem

gate, through which neither pilfering visitors nor pilfering

past, and leaves two thousand years behind him. In
these vast courts and storied halls all is unchanged.
Every pavement, every column, every stair, is in its
place. The roof, but for a few rooﬁng-stones missing
just over the sanctuary, is not only uninjured, but in
good repair. The hieroglyphic inscriptions are as sharp
and legible as the day they were cut. If here and there
a capital, or the face of a human-headed deity, has been
mutilated, these are blemishes which at ﬁrst one scarcely

of the whole. We cross that great courtyard in the full
blaze of the morning sunlight. In the colonnades on
either side there is shade, and in the pillared portico
