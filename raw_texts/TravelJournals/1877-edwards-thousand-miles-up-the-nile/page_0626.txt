secret chambers in other Temples ;1 but not one in which
the old approaches were so perfectly preserved.

From Dabod to Philm is but ten miles; and we are
bound for Torrigoor, which is two miles nearer. Now
Torrigoor is that same village at the foot of the beautiful
sand-drift, near which we moored on our way up the
river; and here we are to stay two days, followed by at
least a week at Philae. No sooner, therefore, have we
reached Torrigoor, than Reis Hassan and three sailors
start for Assouan to buy flour. Old Ali, Riskalli,
and Moosa, whose homes lie in the villages round
about, get leave of absence for a week; and we ﬁnd
ourselves reduced all at once to a crew of ﬁve, with
only Khaleefeh in command. Five, however, are as
good as ﬁfty, when the Dahabeeyah lies moored and
there is nothing to do ; and our ﬁve, having
succeeded in buying some ﬂabby Nubian cakes and

block of masonry so perfectly ﬁtted as to defy detection) were kept,
says M. Mariette, the images of gold and silver and lapis lazuli, the
precious vases, the sistrums, the jewelled collars, and all the portable
treasures of the Temples. We saw a somewhat similar pit and small
chamber in a corner of the Temple of Dakkeh, and some very curious
crypts and hiding places under the ﬂoor of the dark chamber to the E.
of the Sanctuary at Philae, all of course long since broken open and
riﬂed. But we had strong reason to believe that the Painter discovered
the whereabouts of a hidden chamber or passage to the W. of the
Sanctuary, yet closed, with all its treasures probably intact. We had,
however, no means of opening the wall, which is of solid masonry.
