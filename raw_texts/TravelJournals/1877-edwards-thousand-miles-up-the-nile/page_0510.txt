Painter on his big canvas in front of the Temple; the
Writer shifting her little tent as she listed.

Now, although the most delightful occupation in life
is undoubtedly sketching, it must be admitted that the
sketcher at Aboo Simbel works under difﬁculties.
Foremost among these comes the difﬁculty of position.
The great Temple stands within about twenty-ﬁve yards
of the brink of the bank, and the lesser Temple within
as many feet; so that to get far enough from one's
subject is simply impossible. The present Writer
sketched the small Temple from the deck of the
Dahabeeyah; there being no point of view obtainable
on shore.

Next comes the difﬁculty of colour. Everything,
except the sky and the river, is yellow—yellow, that is
to say, “with a difference ;" yellow ranging through every
gradation of orange, maize, apricot, gold, and buff. The
mountains are sandstone; the Temples are sandstone;
the sandslope is powdered sandstone from the sandstone
desert. In all these objects, the scale of colour is
necessarily the same. Even the shadows, glowing with
reﬂected light, give back tempered repetitions of the
dominant hue.. Hence it follows that he who strives,
however humbly, to reproduce the facts of the scene
before him, is compelled, ban gré, ma! gn’, to execute
what some of our young painters would now-a-days call
a Symphony in Yellow.
