the freshness of night and the chill of early morning are
no more. Unless when a strong wind blows from the
North, we no. longer know what it is to need a shawl on
deck in the evening, or an extra covering on our beds
towards dawn. We sleep with our cabin-windows open,
and enjoy a delicious equality of temperature from sun-
down to sunrise. The days and nights, too, are of
almost equal length.

N ow, also, the Southern Cross and a second group
of stars, which we conclude must form part of the
Centaur, are visible between two and four every morning.
They have been creeping up, a star at a time, for the
last fortnight; but are still so low upon the Eastern
horizon that we can only see them when there comes a
break in the mountain-chain on that side of the river.
At the same time, our old familiar friends of the Northern
hemisphere, looking strangely distorted and out of their
proper place, are fast disappearing on the opposite side
of the heavens. Orion seems to be lying on his back,
and the Great Bear to be standing on his tail; while
CassiOpeia and a number of others have deserted en
masse. The zenith, meanwhile, is but thinly furnished;
so that we seem to have travelled away from the one
hemisphere, and not yet to have reached the other. As
for the Southern Cross, we reserve our opinion till we
get farther South. It would be treason to hint that we
are disappointed in so famous a constellation.
