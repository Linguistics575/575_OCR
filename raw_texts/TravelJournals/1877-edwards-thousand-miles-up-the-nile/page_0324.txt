Painter, bent on sketching, started off in search of a
jackal-haunted ruin up a wild ravine on the Libyan side
of the river. The Writer and the Idle Man boldly
mounted camels and rode out into the Arabian desert.
Now the camel-riding that is done at Assouan is of
the most commonplace description, and’ bears to genuine
desert travelling about the same relation that half-an-
hour on the Mer dc Glace bears to the passage of
the Mortaretsch glacier or the ascent of Monte Rosa.
The short cut from Assouan to Philae, or at least the
ride to the granite quarries, forms part of every drago-
man’s programme, and ﬁgures as the crowning achieve-
ment of every Cook's tourist. The Arabs themselves
perform these little journeys much more pleasantly and
expeditiously on donkeys. They take good care, in
fact, never to scale the summit of a camel if they can
help it. But for the impressionable traveller, the
Assouan camel is de rzgueur. In his interests are those
snarling quadrupeds be-tasselled and be-rugged, taken
from their regular work, and paraded up and down the
landing-place. To transport cargoes disembarked above
and below the Cataract is their vocation. Taken from
this honest calling to perform in an absurd little drama
got up especially for the entertainment of tourists, it is
no wonder if the beasts are more than commonly ill-
tempered. They know the whole proceeding to be
essentially cockney, and they resent it accordingly.
