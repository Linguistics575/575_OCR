A ﬂight of quail had risen; and as quail ﬂy low,
skimming the surface of the grain and diving down again
almost immediately, he had taken a level aim. At the
instant that he ﬁred, and in the very path of the quail, a
woman and child who had been squatting in the barley,
sprang up screaming. He at once saw the coming
danger; and, with admirable presence of mind, drew the
charge of his second barrel. He then hid his cartridge-
box and hugged his gun, determined to hold it as long
as possible. The next moment he was surrounded,
overpowered, had the gun wrenched from his grasp, and
received a blow on the back with a stone. Having
captured the gun, one or two of the men let go. It was
then that he shook off the rest, and came back to the
boat. Mehemet Ali at the same time ﬂew to call a
rescue. He, too, came in for some hard knocks, besides
having his shirt rent, and his turban torn off his head.

Here were we, meanwhile, with less than half our
crew, a private war on our hands, no captain, and one of
our three guns in the hands of the enemy. What a
scene it was! A whole village, and apparently a very
considerable village, swarming on the bank; all hurrying
to and fro; all raving, shouting, gesticulating. If we
had been on the verge of a fracas at Tafah, here we
were threatened with a siege.

Drawing in the plank between the boat and the
shore, we held a hasty council of war.
