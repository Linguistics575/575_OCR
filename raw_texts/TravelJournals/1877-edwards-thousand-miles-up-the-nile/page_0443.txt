crown of Egypt. Through her, at all events, Rameses
II. seems to have been in some sense born a king,1 equal
in rank, if not in power, with his father. He is believed
to have succeeded to the throne while yet very young,
and to have learned his ﬁrst war-lesson in the lands south
of the Cataract. The stela of Dakkeh,’ which dates from
the third year of his reign, speaks of him as already
terrible in battle; as “the bull powerful against Ethiopia,
the grifﬁn furious against the negroes, whose grip has
put the mountaineers to ﬂight.” The events of his
second campaign (undertaken two years later in order to
reduce to obedience the revolted tribes of Syria and
Mesopotamia) are immortalised in the poem of Pentaour."2
It was on this occasion that he fought his famous single-
handed ﬁght, against overwhelming odds, in the sight of

these calculations being both made before the discovery of the stela of
Abydos. Bunsen dates his accession from B.C. I3 52; while the
method adopted by Mr. Stuart Poole and others would bring the
beginning of his reign ﬁfty-nine years nearer still to our own epoch.
Between the highest and the lowest of these calculations there is, as
shown by the following table, a difference of I 24 years :—
