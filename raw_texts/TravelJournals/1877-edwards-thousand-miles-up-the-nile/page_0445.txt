According to the last clause of this curious document,
the contracting parties enter also into an agreement to
deliver up to each other the political fugitives of both
countries; providing at the same time for the personal
safety of the offenders. “Whosoever shall be so de-
livered up,” says the treaty, “ himself, his wives, his
children, let him not be smitten to death, moreover, let
him not suffer in his eyes, in his mouth, in his feet, more-
over, let not any crime be set up against him.” 1 This is
the earliest instance of an extradition treaty upon record ;
and it is chieﬂy remarkable as an illustration of the
clemency with which international law was at that time
administered.

Finally, the convention between the sovereigns is
placed under the joint protection of the gods of both
countries :—“ Sutech of Kheta, Ammon of Egypt, and all
the thousand gods, the gods male and female, the gods of
the hills, of the rivers, of the great sea, of the winds and
the clouds, of the land of Kheta and of the land of Egypt.”

Hypostyle Hall at Kamak. The treaty faces to the west, and is
.situate about half-way between the famous has-relief of Sheshonk and
his captives, and the Karnak version of the poem of Pentaour. The
former lies to the west of the southern portal; the latter to the east.
The wall of the treaty juts out about sixty feet to the east of the
portal. This south wall and its adjunct, a length of about 200 feet in
all, is perhaps the most precious and interesting piece of sculptured
surface in the world.
