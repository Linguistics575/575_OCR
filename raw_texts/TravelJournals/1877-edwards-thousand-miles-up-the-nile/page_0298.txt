THEBES TO .4550 UAN. 249

 

unseen behind a ﬁlmy veil; and those two shadowy
towers, rising higher and ever higher on the horizon,
look grey, and ghostly, and far distant still. .

Suddenly the trackers st0p, look back, shout to those
on board, and begin drawing the boat to shore. Reis
Hassan points joyously to a white streak breaking across
the smooth surface of the river about half-a-mile behind.
The Fostat’s sailors are already swarming aloft—the
Bagstones’ trackers are making for home—our own men
are preparing to ﬂing in the rope and jump on board as
the Philae nears the bank.

For the capricious wind, that always springs up when
we don’t want it, is coming!

And now the F ostat, being hindmost, ﬂings out her
big sail and catches the ﬁrst puff; the Bagstones’ turn
comes next; the Philae shakes her wings free, and shoots
ahead; and in fewer minutes than it takes to tell, we are
all three scudding along before a glorious breeze.

The great towers, that showed so far away half-an-
hour ago, are now close at hand. There are palm-woods
about their feet, and clustered huts, from the midst of
which they tower up against the murky sky, magniﬁ-
cently. Soon they are passed and left behind, and the
grey twilight takes them, and we see them no more.
Then night comes on, cold and starless ; yet not too
dark for going as fast as wind and canvas will carry
us.
