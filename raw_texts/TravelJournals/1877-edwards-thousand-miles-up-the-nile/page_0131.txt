Where, however, is the companion colossus? Where
is the Temple itself? Where are the pylons, and the
obelisks, and the avenues of sphinxes? Where, in
short, is Memphis?

The dragoman shrugs his shoulders and points to the
barren mounds among the palms.

They look like gigantic dust-heaps, and stand from
thirty to forty feet above the plain. Nothing grows
upon them, save here and there a tuft of stunted palm;
and their substance seems to consist chieﬂy of crumbled
brick, broken potsherds, and fragments of limestone.
Some few traces of brick foundations and an occasional
block or two of shaped stone are to be seen in places
low down against the foot of one or two of the mounds;
but one looks in vain for any sign that might indicate
the outline of a boundary wall, or the position of a great
public building.

And is this all ?

N o—not quite all. There are some mud-huts yonder,
in among the trees; and in front of one of these we ﬁnd
a number of sculptured fragments—battered sphinxes,
torsos without legs, sitting ﬁgures without heads—in
green, black, and red granite. Ranged in an irregular
semicircle on the sward, they seem to sit in forlorn
conclave, half solemn, half ludicrous, with the goats
browsing round, and the little Arab children hiding
behind them.
