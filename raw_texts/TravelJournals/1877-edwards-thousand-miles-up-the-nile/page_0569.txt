lithography, with a translation from the learned pen of
Dr. Birch. We all know how difﬁcult it is to copy
correctly in a language of which one is ignorant; and
the tiniest curve or dot omitted, is, I am told, fatal to the
sense of these ancient characters. In the present
instance, notwithstanding the care with which the
transcript was made, there must still have been errors;
for it has been found undecipherable in places; and in
these places there occur inevitable lacunae.

Enough, however, remains to show that the lines
were written, not as we had supposed by the artist, but
by a distinguished visitor, whose name unfortunately is
illegible. This visitor was a son of the Prince of Cush,
or as it is literally written, the Royal Son of Cush;
that being the ofﬁcial title of the Governor of Ethi-
Opia.l As there were certainly eight governors of
Ethiopia during the reign of Rameses II. (and perhaps

1 M. Chabas observes that Governors of Ethiopia bore this title,
even though they did not themselves belong to the family of the
Pharaoh (see Antz'quité flirt. p. 141).

It is a curious fact that one of the Governors of Ethiopia during
the reign of Rameses II. was called Mes, or Messou, signifying son, or
child—which is in fact Moses. Now the Moses of the Bible was
adopted by Pharaoh’s daughter, “became to her as a son,” was
instructed in the wisdom of the Egyptians, and married a Cushite
woman, black but comely. It would perhaps be too much to speculate
on the possibility of his having held the ofﬁce of Governor, or Royal
Son of Cush.
