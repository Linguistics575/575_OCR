How well I remember the restless excitement of our
ﬁrst day at Aboo Simbel! While the morning was yet
cool, the Painter and the Writer wandered to and fro,
comparing and selecting points of view, and superintend-

on the very brink of the bank, face to face with the
colossi and the open doorway. The Writer perched
some forty feet higher on the pitch of the sandslope; so
getting a side-view of the facade, and a peep of distance
looking up the river.1 To ﬁx the tent up there was no
easy matter. It was only by sinking the tent-pole in a
hole ﬁlled with stones, that it could be trusted to stand
against the steady push of the north wind, which at this
season is almost always blowing.

Meanwhile the travellers from the other Dahabee-
yahs were tramping backwards and forwards between
the two Temples; ﬁlling the air with laughter, and
waking strange echoes in the hollow mountains. As the
'day wore on, however, they returned to their boats,
which one by one spread their sails and bore away for

VVady Halfeh.
