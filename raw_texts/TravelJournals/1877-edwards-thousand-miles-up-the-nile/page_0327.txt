we had witnessed their demeanour with mingled admira-
tion and envy. Now, modestly conscious of our own
daring, we prepared to do likewise. It was a solemn
moment when, having chosen our beasts, we prepared to
encounter the unknown perils of the desert. What
wonder if the Happy Couple exchanged an affecting
farewell at parting?

We mounted and rode away; two imps of darkness
following at the heels of our camels, and Salame per-
forming the part of bodyguard. Thus attended, we
found ourselves pitched, swung, and rolled along at a
pace that carried us rapidly up the sloPe, past a suburb
full of cafés and grinning dancing girls, and out into the
desert. Our way for the ﬁrst half-mile or so lay among
tombs. A great Mohammedan necropolis, part ancient,
part modern, lies behind Assouan, and covers more
ground than the town itself. Some scores of tiny
i mosques, each t0pped by its little cupola, and all more
or less dilapidated, stand here amid a wilderness
of scattered tombstones. Some are isolated; some
grouped picturesquely together. Each covers, or is
supposed to cover, the grave of a Moslem Santon; but
some are mere commemorative chapels dedicated to
saints and martyrs elsewhere buried. Of simple head-
stones defaced, shattered, overturned, propped back to
back on cairns of loose stones, or piled in broken and
dishonoured heaps, there must be many hundreds.
