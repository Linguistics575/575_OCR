the usual striped tunic. On their heads they wear the
double-crown, and on their necks rich collars of
cabochon drops cut in very low relief. The feet are
bare of sandals, and the arms of bracelets; but in the
front of the body, just where the customary belt and
buckle would come, are deep holes in the stone, such as
might have been made to receive rivets, supposing the
belts to have been made of bronze or gold. On the
breast, just below the necklace, and on the upper part of
each arm, are cut in magniﬁcent ovals, between four and
ﬁve feet in length, the ordinary cartouches of the king.
These were probably tattooed upon his person in the ﬂesh.

Some have supposed that these statues were origin-
ally coloured, and that the colour may have been effaced
by the ceaseless shifting and blowing of the sand. Yet
the drift was probably at its highest when Burckhardt
discovered the place in 1813 ; and on the two heads that
were still above the surface, he seems to have observed
no traces of colour. Neither can the keenest eye‘detect
any vestige of that delicate ﬁlm of stucco with which the

Elephantine, those who were with Psamatichus, the son of Theocles
wrote this. They sailed, and came to above Kerkis, to where the river
rises . . . the Egyptian Amasis. . . . The writer is Damearchon the
son of Amoebichus, and Pelephus (Pelekos), the son of Udamus.” The
king Psamatichus here named has been identiﬁed with the Psamtik I.
of the inscriptions. It was in his reign, and not as it has sometimes
been supposed, in the reign of Psammetichus II., that the great mili-
tary defection took place.
