‘blocks which are our wonder to this day. Harnessed to
rude sledges, they drag them to the river-side and
embark them for transport to the opposite bank}l Some
are so large and so heavy that it takes a month to get
them down from the mountain to the landing-place.‘2
Other Israelites are elsewhere making bricks, digging
canals, helping to build the great wall that reached from
Pelusium to Heliopolis, and strengthening the defences
not only of Pithom and Rameses, but of all the cities

Inscription of Thothmes III. at Kamak, and are supposed by M.
Mariette to be the pe0ple of Ephon. Dr. Birch is of opinion that
there were two tribes of Aperiu, a greater and a lesser, or an upper and

2 In a letter written by a priest who lived during this reign (Ra-
meses 11.), we ﬁnd an interesting account of the disadvantages and
hardships attending various trades and pursuits, as opposed to the
ease and dignity of the sacerdotal ofﬁce. Of the mason he says—“ It
is the climax of his misery to have to remove a block often cubits by
six, a block which it takes a month to drag by the private ways among
the houses.”—Sallier Pap., No. II., Brit. Musae.
