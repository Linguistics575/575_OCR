help secretly rejoicing that Alfred and his gun were
safe on board the Bagstones.

High above the Libyan bank on the sloping verge
of the desert, stands, half-drowned in sand, the little
Temple of Amada. Seeing it from the opposite side
while duck-hunting in the morning, I had taken it
for one of the many stone shelters erected by Moham-
med Ali for the accommodation of cattle levied annually
in the Soudan. It proved, however, to be a temple,
small but massive; built with squared blocks of sand-
stone; and dating back to the very old times of the
Usurtasens and Thothmes. It consists of a portico,
a transverse atrium, and three small chambers. The
pillars of the portico are mere square piers. The rooms
are small and low. The roof, constructed of oblong
blocks, is ﬂat from end to end. As an architectural
structure it is in fact but a few degrees removed from
Stonehenge.

A shed without, this little temple is, however, a
cameo within. Nowhere, save in the tomb of Ti, had we
seen bas-reliefs so delicately modelled, so rich in colour.
‘ Here, as elsewhere, the walls are covered with groups of
Kings and Gods and hieroglyphic texts. The ﬁgures are
slender and animated. The head-dresses, jewellery, and
patterned robes are elaborately drawn and painted.
Every head looks like a portrait; every hieroglyphic
form is a study in miniature. '
