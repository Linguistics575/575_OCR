to the elbow, I 5 feet and 6 inches ; from the inner side of
the elbow joint to the tip of the middle ﬁnger, I 5 feet; and
so on, in relative proportion.‘ If they stood up, they would
tower to a height of at least 83 feet, from the soles of
their feet to the tops of their enormous double-crowns.
Nothing in Egyptian sculpture is perhaps quite so
wonderful as the way in which these Aboo Simbel artists
dealt with the thousands of tons of material to which
they here gave human form. Consummate masters of
effect, they knew precisely what to do, and what to leave
undone. These were portrait statues; therefore they
ﬁnished the heads up to the highest point consistent
with their size. But the trunk and the lower limbs they
regarded from a decorative rather than a statuesque

1 Not, however, in strict proportion, according to the canon discov-
ered some years since by M. Charles Blanc, who found that the middle
ﬁnger, taken as the unit of measurement, corresponded to one nine-
teenth of the total height of the body. The length of the middle
ﬁnger of the Aboo Simbel colossi is exactly three feet, according to
which standard the ﬁgures would measure only 57 feet in height without
the head-dress. Counting, however, from the sole of the foot to the
rise of the crown of the head inside the pschent, their actual height, if
standing erect, would be full 66 feet, or 83 feet including the height
of the pschent.

A close comparison, however, of certain ﬁgures drawn to scale in
squares, some of which are found in tombs at Thebes, one at Memphis,
and some in the portico at Kom Ombo, has satisfactorily proved that
the canon of pr0portion varied from time to time. It was shorter in
the Ptolemaic period than during the XVIIIth and XIXth dynasties.
