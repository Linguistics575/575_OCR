over from Biggeh in the tourist-season. He calls him-
self, with or without authority, the guardian of the island ;
sleeps in a nest of rags and straw in a sheltered corner
behind the great Temple; and is so wonderfully wizened
and bent and knotted up, that nothing of him seems quite
alive except his eyes. We gave him ﬁfty copper paras1
for a parting present when on our way back to Egypt;
and he was so oppressed by the consciousness of wealth,
that he immediately buried his treasure and implored us
to tell no one what we had given him.

With the French siege and the ﬂight of the native
p0pulation closes the last chapter of the local history of
Philee. The Holy Island has done henceforth with wars
of creeds or kings. It disappears from the domain of
history, and enters the domain of science. To have con-
tributed to the discovery of the hieroglyphic alphabet is
a high distinction; and in no sketch of Philae, however
slight, should the obelisk2 that furnished Champollion
with the name of Cleopatra be allowed to pass unnoticed.
This monument, second only to the Rosetta Stone in
point of philological interest, was carried off by Mr. W.
Bankes, the discoverer of the ﬁrst Tablet of Abydos, and
is now in Dorsetshire. Its empty socket and its fellow
obelisk, mutilated and solitary, remain 2'7: 52225 at the
Southern extremity of the island.
