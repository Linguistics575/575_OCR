farewell view of the Alps.

When I say that we were seventeen days getting
from Aboo Simbel to Phila, and that we had the wind
against us from sunrise till sunset almost every day, it
will be seen that our progress was of the slowest. To
those who were tired of Temples, and to the crew who
were running short of bread, these long days of lying up
under the bank, or of rocking to and fro in the middle of
the river, were dreary enough.

Slowly but surely, however, the hard-won miles go
by. Sometimes the barren desert hems us in to right
and left, with never a blade of green between the rock
and the river. Sometimes, as at Tosko,‘ we come
upon an open tract, where there are palms, and castor-
berry plantations, and corn-ﬁelds alive with quail. The
Idle Man goes ashore at Tosko with his gun, while the
Little Lady and the Writer climb a solitary rock about
200 feet above the river. The bank shelves here, and a
crescent-like wave of inundation, about three miles in
length, overflows it every season. From this height one
sees exactly how far the wave goes, and how it must
make a little bay when it is there. Now it is a bay of
barley, full to the brim, and rippling with the breeze.

Beyond the green comes the desert; the one deﬁned

map, on the west.
