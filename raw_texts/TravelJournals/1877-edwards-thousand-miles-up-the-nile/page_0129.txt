And now the desert is left behind, and we are nearing
the palms that lead to Memphis. We have. of course
been dipping into Herodotus—every one takes Herodotus
up the Nile—and our heads are full of the ancient
glories of this famous city. We know that Menes
turned the course of the river in order to build it on this
very Spot; and that all the most illustrious Pharaohs
adorned it with temples, palaces, pylons, and precious
sculptures. We had read of the great Temple of Ptah
that Rameses the Great enriched with colossi of himself;
and of the sanctuary where Apis lived in state, taking
his exercise in a pillared courtyard where every column
was a statue; and of the artiﬁcial lake, and the sacred
‘ groves, and the obelisks, and all the wonders of a city
that even in its later days was one of the most populous
in Egypt.

Thinking over these things by the way, we agree
that it is well to have left Memphis till the last. We
shall appreciate it the better for having ﬁrst 'seen that
other city on the edge of the desert to which, for nearly
six thousand years, all Memphis was quietly migrating,
generation after generation. We know now how poor
folk laboured and how great gentlemen amused them-

Memphis for the mummies of the Sacred Bulls. This, of course, was
done ages before any of the known Apis-catacombs were excavated.
There are doubtless many more of these catacombs yet undiscovered,
nothing prior to the XVIIIth Dynasty having yet been found.
