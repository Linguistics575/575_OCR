Great Temple, cracked one of the Osiride columns of the
First Hall,1 shattered one of the four great Colossi, more
or less injured the other three, ﬂung down the great
brick pylon, reduced the pronaos of the library to a heap
of ruin, and not only brought down part of the ceiling of
the excavated adytum, but rent open a vertical ﬁssure in
the rock, some 20 or 25 feet in length.

With so much irreparable damage done to the Great
Temple, and with so much that was reparable calling for
immediate attention, it is no wonder that these brick
buildings were left to their fate. The priests would have
rescued the sacred books from among the ruins, and then
the place would have been abandoned.

1 That this shock of earthquake occurred during the lifetime of
Rameses 11., seems to be proven by the fact that, where the Osiride
column is cracked across, a wall has been built up to support the two
last pillars to the left at the upper end of the great hall, on which wall
is a large stela covered with an elaborate hieroglyphic inscription,
dating from the xxxvth year, and the 13th day of the month of Tybi,
cf the raga of Karma: 11. The right arm of the external colossus, to
the right of the great doorway, has also been supported by the
introduction of an arm to his throne, built up of square blocks; this
being the only arm to any of the thrones. Miss Martineau detected a
restoration of part of the lower jaw of the northernmost colossus, and
also of a part of the dress of one of the Osiride statues in the great
hall. I have in my possession a photograph taken at a time when the
sand was several feet lower than at present, which shows that the right
leg of the northernmost colossus is also a restoration on a gigantic
scale, being built up, like the throne-arm, in great blocks, and ﬁnished,
most probably, afterwards.
