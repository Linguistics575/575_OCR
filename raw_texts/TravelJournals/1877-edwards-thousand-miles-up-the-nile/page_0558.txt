placed the usual blue lotus with red stalk, and a
spouted vessel in form not unlike a coffee-pot.

To the left of the Horus ensign, seated back-to-back
with Ra upon a similar throne, sits Ammon Ra—of all
Egyptian Gods the most terrible to look upon—with his
blue-black complexion, his corselet of golden chain-
armour, and his head-dress of towering plumes.l Here
the wonderful preservation of the surface enabled one

to see by what means the ancient artists were wont to

1 Ammon of the blue complexion is the most ancient type of this
God. He here represents divine royalty, in which character his title
is :—“ Lord of the Heaven, of the Earth, of the Waters, and of the
Mountains.” “Dans ce role de roi du monde, _Amon a les chairs
peintes en bleu pour indiquer sa nature céleste; et lorsqu’il porte le
titre de Seigneur des Trones, il est représenté assis, la couronne en
téte: d’ordinaire il est debout.”—Etude dc: Monuments dc Kamak.

There were almost as many varieties of Ammon in Egypt as there
are varieties of the Madonna in Italy or Spain. There was an Ammon of
Thebes, an Ammon of Elephantine, an Ammon of Coptos, an Ammon
of Chemmis (Panopolis), an Ammon of the Resurrection, Ammon of
the Dew, Ammon of the Sun (Ammon Ra), Ammon Self-created, etc.
etc. Ammon and Khem were doubtless identical. It is an interest-
ing fact that our English words, chemical, chemist, chemistry, etc.,
which the dictionaries derive from the Arabic al-kz'mz'a, may be traced
back a step farther to the PanOpolitan name of this most ancient God
of the Egyptians, Khem (Gr. Pan ; Latin, Priapus), the deity of plants
and herbs and of the creative principle. A cultivated Egyptian would,
doubtless, have regarded all these Ammons as merely local or sym-
bolical types of a single deity. *
