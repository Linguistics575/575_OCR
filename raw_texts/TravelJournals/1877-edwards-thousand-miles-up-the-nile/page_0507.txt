before. This happy thought was promptly carried into
effect. A scaffolding of spars and oars was at once
improvised, and the men, delighted as children at play,
were soon swarming all over thehuge head, just as the
carvers may have swarmed over it in the days when
Rameses was king.

All they had to do was to remove any small lumps
that might yet adhere to the surface, and then tint the
white patches with coffee. This they did with bits of
sponge tied to the ends of sticks; but Reis Hassan, as a

Mr. Hay, who had with him an Italian assistant,picked up in Cairo. They
took with them some barrels of plaster and a couple of ladders, and con-
trived, with such spars and poles as belonged to the Dahabeeyah, to erect
a scaffolding and a matted shelter for the plasterman. The Colossus was
at this time buried up to its chin in sand, which made their task so
much the easier. When the mould of the head was brought to
England, it was sent to Mr. Bonomi’s studio, together with a mould of
the head of the Colossus at Mitrahenny, a mould of the apex of
the fallen obelisk at Karnak, and moulds of the wall-sculptures at
Bayt-el-Welly. Mr. Bonomi superintended the casting and placing
of all these in the Museum about three years after the moulds were
made. This was at the time when Mr. Hawkins held the post of
Keeper of Antiquities. I mention these details, not simply because they
have a special interest for all who are acquainted with Aboo Simbel,
but because a good deal of misapprehension has prevailed on the
subject, some travellers attributing the disﬁgurement of the head to
Lepsius, others to the Crystal Palace Company, and so forth. Even
so careful a writer as the late Miss Martineau ascribes it, on hearsay,
to Champollion.
