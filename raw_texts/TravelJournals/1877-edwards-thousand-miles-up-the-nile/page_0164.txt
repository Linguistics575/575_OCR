that is alone enough to engender disease. To brush
away the ﬂies that beset their eyes is impious; hence
Ophthalmia and various kinds of blindness. I have seen
infants lying in their mothers’ arms with six or eight ﬂies
in each eye. I have seen the little helpless hands put
down reprovingly, if they approached the seat of annoy-
ance. I have seen children of four and ﬁve years old
with the surface of one or both eyes eaten away; and
others with a large ﬂeshy lump growing out where the
pupil had been destroyed. Taking these things into
account, the wonder is, after all, not that three children
should die in Egypt out of every ﬁve—not that each
twentieth person in certain districts should be blind, or
partially blind; but that so many as forty per cent of the
whole infant population should actually live to grow up,
and that ninety-ﬁve per cent should enjoy the blessing
of sight. For my own part, I had not been many weeks
on the Nile before I began systematically to avoid
going about the native towns whenever it was practicable,
to do so. That I may so have lost an Opportunity of
now and then seeing more of the street-life of the pe0ple
is very probable; but such outside glimpses are of little
real value, and I at all events escaped the sight of much
poverty, sickness, and squalor. The condition of the
inhabitants is not worse, perhaps, in an Egyptian Beled1
than in many an Irish village; but the condition of the

' Baird—Village.
