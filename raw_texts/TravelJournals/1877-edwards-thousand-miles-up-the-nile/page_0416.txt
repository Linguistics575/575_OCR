Apart from its exquisite ﬁnish, the wall-sculpture of
Amada has, however, nothing in common with the wall-

period of Egyptian Renaissance; and, though inferior in
power and naturalness to the work of the elder school,
it marks just that moment of special development when
the art of modelling in low relief had touched the highest

belongs to the reigns of Thothmes the Second and
Thothmes the Third; just as the perfect era in archi-
tecture belongs to the reigns of Seti the First and

is so precious. It registers an epoch in the history of
the art, and gives us the best of that epoch in the
hour of its zenith. The sculptor is here seen to be
working within bounds already prescribed; yet within
those bounds he still enjoys a certain liberty. His art,
though largely conventionalised, is not yet stereotyped.
His sense of beauty still ﬁnds expression. There is,
in short, a grace and sweetness about the bas-relief
designs of Amada for which one looks in vain to the
storied walls of Karnak. _

against the Ruten, slew seven kings with his own hand;
