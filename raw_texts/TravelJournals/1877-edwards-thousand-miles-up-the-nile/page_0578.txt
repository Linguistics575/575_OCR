bottom of an hour-glass. I am informed by the Painter
that when the top of the doorway was found and an
opening ﬁrst effected, the sand poured out from wit/tin,

top of the ﬁssure.

The Painter wrote his name and ours, with the date
(February 16th, I874), on a space of blank wall over the
inside of the doorway; and this was the only occasion
upon which any of us left our names upon an Egyptian
monument. On arriving at Korosko, where there is a
post-ofﬁce, he also despatched a letter to the “Times,”

which appeared on the 18th of March following, is
reprinted in the Appendix at the end of this book.
