with every word he uttered. The fact is, however, that
the Fellah is half a savage. Notwithstanding his
mendacity—(and it must be owned that he is the most
brilliant liar under heaven)——he remains a singularly
transparent piece of humanity; easily amused, easily
deceived, easily angered, easily paciﬁed. He steals a
little, cheats a little, lies a great deal; but on the other
hand he is patient, hospitable, affectionate, trustful. He
suspects no malice, and bears none. He commits no
great crimes. He is incapable of revenge. In short,
his good points outnumber his bad ones; and what man
or nation need hope for a much better character P

To generalise in this way may seem like presumption
on the part of a passing stranger; yet it is more ex-
cusable as regards Egypt than it would be of any other
equally accessible country. In Europe, and indeed in
most parts of the East, one sees too little of the people
to be able to form an opinion about them; but it is not
so on the Nile. Cut off from hotels, from railways, from
Europeanised cities, you are brought into continual inter-
course with natives. The sick who come to you for
medicines, the country gentlemen and government
ofﬁcials who visit you on board your boat and enter-
tain you on shore, your guides, your donkey-boys, the
very dealers who live by cheating you, furnish endless
studies of character, and teach you more of Egyptian life
than all the books of Nile-travel that ever were written.
