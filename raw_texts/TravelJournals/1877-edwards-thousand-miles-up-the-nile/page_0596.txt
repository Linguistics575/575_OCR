characters, or cartouches by which to date the building,
we looked in vain.1

Dakkeh comes next in order; then Gerf Hossayn,
Dendoor, and Kalabsheh. Arriving at Dakkeh soon
after sunrise, we ﬁnd the whole p0pulation—screaming,
pushing, chattering, laden with eggs, pigeons, and gourds
for sale—drawn up to receive us. There is a large sand
island in the way here; so we moor about a mile above
the Temple.

We ﬁrst saw the twin pylons of Dakkeh some weeks
ago from the deck of the Philze, and we then likened
them to the majestic towers of Edfoo. Approaching
them now by land, we are surprised to ﬁnd them so
small. It is a brilliant, hot morning; and our way lies
by the river, between the lentil slope and the castor-
berry patches. There are ﬂocks of pigeons ﬂying low
overhead ; barking dogs and crowing cocks in the village
close by; and all over the path, hundreds of beetles—

‘ A clue, however, might possibly be found to the date. There is
a rudely sculptured tableau—the only piece of sculpture in the place—
on a detached wall near the standing columns. It represents Isis
worshipped by a youth in a short toga. Both ﬁgures are lumpish and
ill-modelled; and Isis, seated under a conventional ﬁg—tree, wears her
hair erected in stiff rolls over the forehead, like a diadem. It is the
face and stifﬂy-dressed hair of Marciana, the sister of Trajan, as shown
upon the well-known coin engraved in Smith’s Dir. of Greek and Roman
szgrap/zy, vol. ii. p. 939. Maharrakeh is the Hiera Sycaminos, or
Place of the Sacred Fig-tree, where ends the Itinerary of Antoninus.
