evidently an ancient Egyptian, that we ﬁnd ourselves
wondering how he escaped being mummiﬁed four or ﬁve
thousand years ago.

By and by a little breeze springs up. The men drop
the rope and jump on board—the big sail is set—the
breeze freshens—and away we go again, as merrily as
the day we left Cairo. Towards sunset we see a strange
object, like a giant obelisk broken off half-way, standing
up on the Western bank against an orange-gold sky.
This is the yet unopened Pyramid of Maydoom, commonly
called the False Pyramid. It looks quite near the bank;
but this is an effect of powerful light and shadow, for it
lies back at least four miles from the river. That night,
having sailed on till past nine o’clock, we moor about
a mile from Benisooef, and learn with some surprise

he takes hold of the cord by which the empty bucket is suspended, and
bending down, by the mere weight of his shoulders dips it in the water.
His eﬂ'ort to rise gives the bucket full of water an upward cant, which,
with the aid of the equipoising lump of clay at the other end of the
pole, lifts it to a trough into which, as it tilts on one side, it empties
its contents. What he has done has raised the water six or seven feet
above the level of the river. But if the river has subsided twelve or
fourteen feet, it will require another Shadoof to be worked in the
trough into which the water of the ﬁrst has been brought. If the river
has sunk still more, a third will be required before it can be lifted to
the top of the bank, so as to enable it to ﬂow off to the ﬁelds that
require irrigation."——-Egypt cy“ 1/1: P/zarao/i: and Ill: Klzediw, p. 445
