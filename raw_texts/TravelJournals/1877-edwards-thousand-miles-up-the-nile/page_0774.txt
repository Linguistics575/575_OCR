this tableau, Seti I. and Rameses II. are seen, the one
offering incense, the other reciting a hymn of praises,
to the manes of seventy-six Pharaohsﬁl beginning with
Mena, and ending with Seti himself. To our great dis-
appointment—though one cannot but acquiesce in the
necessity for precaution—we found the entrance to this
corridor closed and mounded up. A ragged old Arab
who haunts the Temple in the character of ' custode, told
us that the tablet could now only be seen by the special
permission of Mariette-Bey.

We seemed to have been here about half-an-hour,
when the guide came to warn us of approaching evening.
We had yet the site and the great Tumulus of Teni to

‘ M. Mariette is of opinion that these seventy-six Pharaohs (repre-
sented by their cartouches) were either princes born of families
originally from Abydus, or that they were sovereigns who had acquired
a special title to veneration at this place on account of monuments or
pious foundations presented by them to the holy city. A similar tablet,
erected apparently on the same principles though not altogether to the
Same kings, was placed by Thothmes III. in aside chamber of the
Great Temple at Karnak, and is now in the Louvre.

The great value of the present monument consists in its chro-
nological arrangement. It is also said to be of most beautiful
execution, and in perfect preservation. “ Comme perfection de
gravure, comme conservation, comme étendue, il est peu de monu-
ments qui 1a depassent.” See [a Nouvelle Table d’A/Iydos, par
A. MARIETrE-BEY: Révue Arvin, vol. vii., Nouvelle Série, p. 98.
This volume of the Review also contains an engraving in outline of
the Tablet.
