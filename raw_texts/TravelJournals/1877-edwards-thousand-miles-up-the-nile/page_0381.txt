But upon this point, history is vague 1 and the grafﬁti of
the time are silent. We only know for certain that the
old went out, and the new came in; and that where the
resurrected Osiris was wont to be worshipped according
to the most sacred mysteries of the Egyptian ritual, the
resurrected Christ was now adored after the simple fashion
of the primitive Coptic Church.

And now the Holy Island, near which it was
believed no ﬁsh had power to swim or bird to ﬂy, and
upon whose soil no pilgrim might set foot without per-
mission, became all at once the common property of a
populous community. Courts, colonnades, even terraced
roofs, were overrun with little crude-brick dwellings. A
small basilica was built at the lower end of the island.
The portico of the Great Temple was converted into a
Chapel, and dedicated to Saint Stephen. “This good
work,” says a Greek inscription traced there by some
monkish hand of the period, “was done by the well-
beloved of God, the Abbot-Bishop Theodore.” Of this
same Theodore, whom another inscription styles “the
very holy father,” we know nothing but his name.

The walls hereabout are full of these fugitive records.

1 The Emperor Justinian is credited with the mutilation of the
sculptures of the large Temple ; but the ancient worship was probably
only temporarily suspended in his time.
