A. M‘CALLUM, Esq., to the EDITOR of the ‘ TIMES."

SIR—It may interest your readers to learn that at the south side of the
great Temple of Aboo Simbel, I found the entrance to a painted chamber
rock-cut, and measuring 21 ft. 25 in., by 14 ft. 8 in., and 12 ft. high to the
Spring of the arch, elaborately sculptured and painted in the best style of
the best period of Egyptian art, bearing the portraits of Rameses the Great
and his cartouches, and in a state of the highest preservation. This
chamber is preceded by the ruins of a vaulted atrium, in sun-dried brick-
work, and adjoins the remains of what would appear to be a massive wall or
pylon, which contains a staircase terminating in an arched doorway leading
to the vaulted atrium before mentioned.

The doorway of the painted chamber, the staircase, and the arch, were
all buried in sand and débris. The chamber appears to have been covered
and lost sight of since a very early period, being wholly free from mutilation,
and from the scribbling of travellers ancient and modern.

The staircase was not opened until the 18th, and the bones of a woman
and child, with two small cinerary urns, were there discovered by a gentle-
man of our party, buried in the sand. This was doubtless a subsequent
interment. \Vhether this painted chamber is the inner sanctuary of a small
Temple, or part of a tomb, or only a speos, like the well-known grottoes at
lbrim, is a question for future excavators to determine.—l have the honour
to be, Sir, yours, etc. etc. ANDREW M‘CALLUM.
