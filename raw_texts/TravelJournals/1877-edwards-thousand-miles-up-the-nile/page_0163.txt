into the midst of a large crowd, one observed the pe0ple
more narrowly, but I certainly never saw so many one-
eyed human beings as that morning at Minieh. There
must have been present in the streets and market-place
from ten to twelve thousand natives of all ages, and I
believe it is no exaggeration to say that at least every
twentieth person, down to little toddling children of three
and four years of age, was blind of an eye. Not being
a particularly well-favoured race, this defect added the
last touch of repulsiveness to faces already sullen, igno-
rant, and unfriendly. A more unprepossessing p0pulation
I would never wish to see—the men half stealthy, half
insolent ; the women bold and ﬁerce; the children ﬁlthy,
sickly, stunted, and stolid. Nothing in provincial Egypt
is so painful to witness as the neglected condition of
very young children. Those belonging to even the
better class are for the most part shabbily clothed and of
more than doubtful cleanliness; while the offspring of
.the very poor are simply encrusted with dirt and sores,
and swarming with vermin. It is at ﬁrst hard to believe
that the parents of these unfortunate babies err, not from
cruelty, but through sheer ignorance and superstition.
Yet so it is; and the time when these people can be
brought to comprehend the most elementary principles
of sanitary reform is yet far distant. To wash young
children is injurious to health; therefore, the mothers
suffer them to fall into a state of personal uncleanliness
