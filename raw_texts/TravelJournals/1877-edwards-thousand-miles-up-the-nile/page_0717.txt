The wall-sculptures at Goornah are extremely
beautiful, especially those erected by Seti I. Where
it has been accidentally preserved, the surface is as
smooth, the execution as brilliant, as the ﬁnest medizeval
ivory carving. Behind a broken column, for instance,
that leans against the SW. wall of the sanctuary,ll one
may see, by peeping this way and that, the ram’s-head
prow of asacred boat, quite unharmed, and of surpassing
delicacy. The modelling of the ram’s head is simply
faultless. It would indeed be scarcely too much to say
that this one fragment, if all the rest had perished, would
alone place the decorative sculpture of ancient Egypt in
a rank second only to that of Greece.

The Temple of Goornah—northernmost of the
Theban group—stands at the mouth of that famous
valley called by the Arabs Bab el Molook, and by
travellers, the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings. This
valley may be described as a bifurcated ravine, ending
in two culs a’e sacs, and hemmed in on all sides by lime-
stone precipices. It winds round behind the cliffs which

tout a fait particulier est celle que les inscriptions hiéroglyphiques
désignent par le titre ‘prOphEte de la pyramide, de tel pharaon.’ Il
parait qu’aprés sa mort chaque roi était vénéré par un culte spécial.”

‘ There is a very curious window at the end of this sanctuary, with
grooves for the shutter, and holes in which to slip and drop the bar by
which it was fastened.
