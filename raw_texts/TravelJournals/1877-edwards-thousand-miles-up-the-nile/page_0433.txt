Being obliged to moor a few miles beyond Derr, and
having lain awake half the night, we offered a sakkieh-
driver a couple of dollars if he would let his wheel rest
till morning. But time and water are more precious
than even dollars at this season; and the man refused.
All we could do, therefore, was to punt into the middle
of the river, and lie off at a point as nearly as possible
equidistant from our two nearest enemies.

The native dearly loves the tree that costs him so
much labour, and thinks it the chef d’oeuvre of creation.
When Allah made the ﬁrst man, says an Arab legend,
he found he had a little clay to spare; so with that he
made the palm. And to the poor Nubian, at all events,
the gifts of the palm are almost divine; supplying food
for his children, thatch for his hovel, timber for his
water-wheel, ropes, matting, cups, bowls, and even the
strong drink forbidden by the Prophet. The date-wine
is yellowish-white, like whisky. It is not a wine, how-
ever, but a spirit; coarse, ﬁery, and unpalatable.

Certain trees—as for instance the perky little pine
of the German wald—are apt to become monotonous;
but one never wearies of the palm. Whether taken
singly or in masses, it is always graceful, always
suggestive. To the sketcher on the Nile, it is simply
invaluable. It breaks the long parallels of river and
bank, and composes with the stern lines of Egyptian
architecture as no other tree in the world could do.
