selves in those early days when there were hundreds of
Ti’s with town-houses at Memphis and villas by the Nile.
From the Serapeum, too, buried and ruined as it is, one
cannot but come away with a profound impression of the
splendour and power of a religion that could command
for its myths such faith, such homage, and such public
works.

And now we are once more in the midst of the palm-
woods, threading our way among the same mounds that
we passed in the morning. Presently those in front
strike away from the beaten road across a grassy ﬂat to
the right; and the next moment we are all gathered
round the brink of a muddy pool in the midst of which
lies a shapeless block of blackened and corroded lime-
stone. This, it seems, is the famous prostrate colossus
of Rameses the Great, which (like the fallen obelisk at
Alexandria known as Cleopatra’s Needle) belongs to
the British Museum, but which the British government
is too economical to remove. So here it lies, face down-
ward; drowned once a year by the Nile; visible only
when the pools left by the inundation have evaporated,
and all the muddy hollows are dried up. It is one of two
which stood at the entrance to the great Temple of
Ptah ; and by those who have gone down into the hollow
and seen it from below in the dry season, it is reported of
as a noble and very beautiful specimen of the best period
of Egyptian art.
