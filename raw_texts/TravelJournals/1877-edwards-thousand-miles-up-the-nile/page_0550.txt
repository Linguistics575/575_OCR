found so abundantly at Thebes. They bore no stamp,
and were much shorter and more lumpy in shape.
Finally, the cones being all removed, we came to a
compact and solid ﬂoor of baked clay.

The Painter, meanwhile, had also been at work.
Having traced the circuit and drawn out a ground-plan,
he came to the conclusion that the whole mass adjoining
the southern wall of the Speos was in fact composed of
the ruins of a pylon, the walls of which were seven
feet in thickness, built in regular string-courses of
moulded brick, and ﬁnished at the angles with the usual
torus, or round moulding. The superstructure, with its
chambers, passages, and top cornice, was gone; and this
part with which we were now concerned was merely the
basement, and included the bottom of the staircase.

The Painter’s ground-plan demolished all our hopes
at one fell swoop. The vault was a vault no longer.
The staircase led to no sepulchral chamber. The brick
ﬂoor hid no secret entrance. Our mummies melted into
thin air, and we were left with no excuse for carrying on
the excavations. We were mortally disappointed. In vain
we told ourselves that the discovery of a large brick
pylon, the existence of which had been unsuspected by
preceding travellers, was an event of greater importance
than the ﬁnding of a tomb. We had set our hearts on
the tomb; and I am afraid we cared less than we ought
for the pylon.
