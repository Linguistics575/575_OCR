clay at the head. Wherever we saw a burial-ground in
Nubia, we saw these bowls upon the graves. The
mourners, they told us, mourn here for forty days;
during which time they come every Friday and ﬁll the
bowl with fresh water, that the birds may drink from it.
The bowls on the other graves were dry and full of sand ;
but the new bowl was brimming full, and the water in it
was hot to the touch.

We found L. and the Happy Couple standing at bay
with their backs against a big lebbich tree, surrounded by
an immense crowd and far from comfortable. Bent on
“bazaaring,” they had probably shown themselves too
ready to buy; so bringing the whole population, with all
the mats, baskets, nose-rings, ﬁnger-rings, necklaces and
bracelets in the place, about their ears. Seeing the
straits they were in, we ran to the Dahabeeyah and
despatched three or four sailors to the rescue, who
brought them off in triumph.

Even in Egypt, it does not answer, as a rule, to go
about on shore without an escort. The pe0ple are apt
to be importunate, and can with difﬁculty be kept at
a pleasant distance. But in Nubia, where the traveller’s
life was scarcely safe ﬁfty years ago, unprotected
Ingleezeh are pretty certain to be disagreeably mobbed.
The natives, in truth, are still mere savages cm fond——
the old war-paint being but half disguised under a thin

veneer of Mohammedanism.
