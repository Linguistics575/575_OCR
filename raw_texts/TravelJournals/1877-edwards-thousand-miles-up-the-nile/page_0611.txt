ill-treatment to which they have been subjected by natives
and visitors, they are still beautiful. The colour of those
in the rooﬂess courtyard, though so perfect when Mr.
Bonomi executed his admirable facsimiles, has now almost

ushers us into the presence of Augustus, and we pass, as

to the presence-chamber of the Caesars.

But if the decorative work in the presence-chamber
of the Caesars was anything like the decorative work in

and spotted and cross-barred robes; such outrageous
head-dresses; such crude and violent colouring,2 we have

ultramarine. There are also traces of gilding on many of the ﬁgures.
