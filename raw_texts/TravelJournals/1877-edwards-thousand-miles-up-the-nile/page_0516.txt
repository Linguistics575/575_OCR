like the isolated Rocher d'e Corneille and Rocher de St.
Michel at Puy, they might be but fragments of a rocky
crust, rent and swept away at some inﬁnitely remote
period of the world’s history, and that the level of their
present summits might represent perhaps the ancient
level of the plain.

As regards form, they are weird enough for the
wildest geological theories. All taper more or less
towards the top. One is four-sided, like a pyramid;
another, in shape a truncated cone, looks as if crowned
with a pagoda summer-house; a third seems to be sur-
mounted by a mosque and cupola; a fourth is scooped
out in tiers of arches; a ﬁfth is crowned, apparently,
with a cairn of piled stones; and so on with variations
as endless as they are fantastic. A geologist might
perhaps account for these caprices by showing how ﬁre,
and earthquake, and deluge, had here succeeded each
other; and how, after being ﬁrst covered with volcanic
stones and then split into chasms, the valleys thus Opened
had by and by been traversed by torrents'which wore
away the softer parts of the rock and left the harder
standing.

Some way beyond Kalat Adda, when the Aboo
Simbel range and the palm island have all but vanished
in the distance, and the lonely peak, called the Mountain
of the Sun (Gebel esh-Shems), has been left far behind,

we come upon a new wonder—~namely, upon two groups
