ﬁdelity with which “the Nubian characteristics ” have
been seized.

Yet, in truth, the head of the young Augustus is not
cast in a loftier mould. These statues are portraits—
portraits of the same man four times repeated; and that
man is Rameses the Great.

Now, Rameses the Great, if he was as much like his
portraits as his portraits are like each other, must have
been one of the handsomest men, not only of his own
day, but of all history. Wheresoever we meet with him,
whether in the fallen colossus at Memphis, or in the
syenite torso of the British Museum, or among the

Sutech, qui éclate dés l’abord par le nom de Séti 1m (Set/10:), ainsi

Egypte. Nous savions méme que Ramses II. avait épousé une ﬁlle du
prince de Khet, quand le traité de l’an 22 eut ramené la paix entre les
deux pays. Le proﬁl trés-décidément sémitique de Séti et de Ramses
se distinguait nettement des ﬁgures ordinaires de nos Pharaons
Thébains.” (See Revue Arc/téologiguc, vol. ix. A.D. 1864.) In the
course of the same letter, M. de Rougé adverts to the magniﬁcent re-
storation of the Temple of Sutech at Tanis (San) by Rameses II., and
to the curious fact that the God is there represented with the peculiar
head—dress worn elsewhere by the Prince of Kheta.

It is to be remembered, however, that the patron deity of Rameses
II. was Ammon Ra. His homage of Sutech (which might possibly
have been a concession to his Khetan wife) seems to have been con-
ﬁned almost exclusively to Tanis, where Ra-ma-ur-nofre may be supposed
to have resided.
