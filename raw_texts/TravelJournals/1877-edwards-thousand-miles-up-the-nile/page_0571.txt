monument the entire length of which, from the doorway
of the pronaos to the west wall of the adytum, was less
than 47 feet. We therefore concluded that the pylon
belonged to the large temple, and was erected at the
side, instead of in front of the facade, on account of the
very narrow space between the mountain and the river}l

The pylon at Kom Ombo is, probably for the same
reason, placed at the side of the Temple and on a lower
level. To those who might object that a brick pylon
would hardly be attached to a Temple of the ﬁrst class,
I would observe that the remains of a similar pylon are
still to be seen at the t0p of what was once the landing-
place leading to the Great Temple at Wady Halfeh. It
may, therefore, be assumed that this little monument,
although connected with the pylon by means of a door-
way and staircase, was an excrescence of later date.

Being an excrescence, however, was it, in the strict
sense of the word, a Temple ?

Even this seems to be doubtful. In the adytum
there is no trace of any altar—no fragment of stone dais
or sculptured image—no granite shrine, as at Philae—no
sacred recess, as at Denderah. The standard of Horus

Aroe'ris, engraved on page 499, occupies the centre place

' At about an equal distance to the N. of the Great Temple, on
the verge of the bank, is a shapeless block of brick ruin, which might
possibly, if investigated, turn out to be the remains of a second pylon
corresponding to this which we partially uncovered to the S.
