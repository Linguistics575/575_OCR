For the rest, it is safe to conclude that he was neither
better nor worse than the general run of Oriental despots
-——that he was ruthless in war, prodigal in peace, rapacious
of booty, and unsparing in the exercise of almost bound-
less power. Such pride and such despotism were, how-
ever, in strict accordance with immemorial precedent,
and with the temper of the age in which he lived. The
Egyptians would seem, beyond all doubt, to have be-
lieved that their King was always, in some sense, divine.
They wrote hymns1 and offered up prayers to him, and
regarded him as the living representative of Deity. His
princes and ministers habitually addressed him in the
language of worship. Even his wives, who ought to
have known better, are represented in the performance of
acts of religious adoration before him. What wonder,
then, if the man so deiﬁed believed himself a god ?
