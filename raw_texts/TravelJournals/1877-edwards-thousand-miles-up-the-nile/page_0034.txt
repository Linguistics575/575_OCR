having driven on from the station in advance of drago-
man and luggage, we were but just in time to take seats
with the rest. We intended, of course, to go up the Nile;
and had any one ventured to inquire in so many words
what brought us to Egypt, we should have replied :—
“ Stress of weather.”

For in simple truth we had drifted hither by accident,
with no excuse of health, or business, or any serious
object whatever; and had just taken refuge in Egypt as
one might turn aside into the Burlington Arcade or the
Passage des Panoramas—to get out of the rain.

And with good reason. Having left home early in
September for a few weeks’ sketching in central France,
we had been pursued by the wettest of wet weather.
Washed out of the hill-country, we fared no better in the
plains. At Nismes it poured for a month without stop-
ping. Debating at last whether it were better to take
our wet umbrellas back at once to England, or push on
farther still in search of sunshine, the talk fell upon
Algiers—Malta—Cairo ; and Cairo carried it. Never was
distant expedition entered upon with less premeditation.
The thing was no sooner decided than we were gone.
Nice, Genoa, Bologna, Ancona ﬂitted by, as in a dream;
and Bedreddin Hassan when he woke at the gates of
Damascus was scarcely more surprised than the writer
of these pages, when she found herself on board the
“ Simla,” and steaming out of the port of Brindisi.
