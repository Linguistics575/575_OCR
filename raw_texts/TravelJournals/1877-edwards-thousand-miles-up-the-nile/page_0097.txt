There are, of course, good and bad Mahommedans, as
there are good and bad churchmen of every denomi—
nation; and we had both sorts on board. Some of the
men were very devout, never failing to perform their
ablutions and say their prayers at sunrise and sunset.
Others never dreamed of doing so. Some would not
touch wine—had never tasted it in their lives, and would
have suffered any extremity rather than break the law of
their Prophet. Others had a nice taste in clarets, and a
delicate appreciation of the respective merits of rum or
whisky punch. It is, however, only fair to add that we
never gave them these things except on special occasions,
as on Christmas Day, or when they had been wading in
the river, or in some other way undergoing extra fatigue
in our service. Nor do I believe there was a man on
board who would have spent a para of his scanty earnings
on any drink stronger than coffee. Coffee and tobacco
are, indeed, the only luxuries in which the Egyptian
peasant indulges; and our poor fellows were never more
grateful than when we distributed among them a few
pounds of cheap native tobacco. This abominable mix-
ture sells in the Bazaars at sixpence the pound. The
plant is raised from inferior seed in a soil chemically
unsuitable, because wholly devoid of potash.
