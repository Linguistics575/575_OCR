Most of the tombs at Bab-el-Molook were Open in
Ptolemaic times. Being then, as now, among the stock

stela, with his hound, named Bahuka, between his legs. Veriﬁed this
day, and found intact.” Such was the report of the writer of this
papyrus of 3000 years ago. Now comes one of the wonders of modern
