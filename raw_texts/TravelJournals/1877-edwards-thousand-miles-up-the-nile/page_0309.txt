His boys anoint their bodies with it. His home,.his
breath, his garments, his food, are redolent of it. It per-
vades the very air in which he lives and has his being.
Happy the European traveller who, while his lines are
cast in Nubia, can train his degenerate nose to delight in
the aroma of castor-oil !

The march of civilisation is driving these fringes out
of fashion on the frontier. At Assouan, they are chieﬂy
in demand among English and American visitors. Most
people purchase a “ Madame Nubia” for the entertain-
ment of friends at home. L., who is given to vanities in
the way of dress, bought one so steeped in fragrance that
it scented the Philae for the rest of the voyage, and
retains its odour to this day.

Almost before the mooring-rope was made fast, our
Painter, arrayed in a gorgeous keﬁah and armed with
the indispensable visiting-cane, had sprung ashore and
hastened to call upon the Governor. A couple of hours
later, the Governor (having promised to send at once for
the Sheykh of the Cataract and to forward our going by
all means in his power) returned the visit. He brought
with him the Mudeer1 and Kadee2 of Assouan, each
attended by his pipe-bearer.

We received our guests with due ceremony in the
saloon. The great men placed themselves on one of the
side-divans; and the Painter opened the conversation by

1 Marker: Chief Magistrate. 2 Karla: Judge.
