real, live scarabs, black as coal and busy as ants—rolling
their clay pellets up from the water's edge to the desert.
If we were to examine a score or so of these pellets, we
should here and there ﬁnd one that contained no eggs;
for it is a curious fact that the scarab-beetle makes and
rolls her pellets, whether she has an egg to deposit or
not. The female beetle, though assisted by the male, is
said to do the heavier share of the pellet-rolling; and if
evening comes on before her pellet is safely stowed away,
she will sleep holding it with her feet all night, and
resume her labour in the morning.1

The Temple here—begun by an Ethiopian king
named Arkaman (Ergamenes), about whom Diodorus
Siculus has a long story to tell, and carried on by the
Ptolemies and Czesars—stands in a desolate Open space
to the north of the village, and is approached by an
avenue, the walls of which are constructed with blocks
from some earlier building. The whole of this avenue
and all the waste ground for three or four hundred yards
round about the Temple, is not merely strewn but piled
with fragments of pottery, pebbles, and large smooth
stones of porphyry, alabaster, basalt, and a kind of
marble like verde antico. These stones are puzzling.
