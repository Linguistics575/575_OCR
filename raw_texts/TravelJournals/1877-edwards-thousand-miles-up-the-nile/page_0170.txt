speed we can. Things do not, of course, always fall out

fails when we most need it, and gets up when there is
something to be seen on shore. Thus, after a whole

and put Off till our return the inland excursion to Dayr
el N akhl, where is to be seen the famous painting of the
Colossus on the Sledge. But sights deferred are fated
