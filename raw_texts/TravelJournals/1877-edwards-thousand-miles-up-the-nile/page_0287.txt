in, the solid mound beyond. .The light, however, comes
in from so high up, and through so narrow a space, that

The Temple is dedicated to Kneph, the Soul of the
World, whom we now see for the ﬁrst time. He is
ram-headed, and holds in his hand the tau, or emblem of

Quelquefois 1e dieu est armé d’une épée qu’il brandit au-dessus de sa
téte; dans ce role, il semble 1e dieu des combats. Plus souvent c’est
1e dieu de la danse, de la musique, des plaisirs.”—Marz'etfe Ba.
