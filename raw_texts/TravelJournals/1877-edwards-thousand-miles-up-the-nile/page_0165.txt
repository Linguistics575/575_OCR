children is so distressing that one would willingly go any
number of miles out of the way rather than witness their
suffering, without the power to alleviate it.1

If the population in and about Minieh are personally
unattractive,‘ their appearance at all events matches their
reputation, which is as bad as that of their neighbours.
Of the manners and customs of Benisouef we had already
some experience; while public opinion charges Minieh,
Rhoda, and most of the towns and villages north of
Siout, with the like marauding propensities. As for the
villages at the foot of Beni Hassan, they have been mere
dens of thieves for many generations ; and though razed
to the ground some years ago by way of punishment,
are now rebuilt, and in as bad odour as ever. It is
necessary, therefore, in all this part of the river, not only
to hire guards at night, but, when the boat is moored, to

keep a sharp look-out against thieves by day. In Upper

Egypt it is very different. There the natives are good-~

‘ Miss Whately, whose evidence on this subject is peculiarly valu-
able, states that the majority of native children die off at, or under, two
years of age (Among t/zc Hair, p. 29); while M. About, who en-
joyed unusual opportunities of inquiring into facts connected with the
population and resources of the country, says that the nation loses
three children out of every ﬁve. “L’ignorance publique, l’oubli des
premiers éléments d’hygiene, la mauvaise alimentation, l’absence presque
totale des soins médicaux, tarissent la nation dans sa source. Un
peuple qui perd réguli'érement trois enfants sur cinq ne saurait croitre
sans miracle.”-——Lc Fella/z, p. 165.
