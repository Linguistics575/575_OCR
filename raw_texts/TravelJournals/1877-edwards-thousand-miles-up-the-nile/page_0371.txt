the intricate paintings on the ceilings, the colours upon
the capitals, are incredibly fresh and perfect. These
exquisite capitals have long been the wonder and delight
of travellers in Egypt. They are all studied from natural
forms—from the lotus in bud and blossom, the papyrus,
and the palm. Conventionalised with consummate skill,
they are at the same time so justly proportioned to the
height and girth of the columns as to give an air of won-
derful lightness to the whole structure. But above all, it
is with the colour—colour conceived in the tender and
pathetic minor of W atteau and Lancret and Greuze—
that one is most fascinated. Of those delicate half-
tones, not even the careful facsimile in the “ Grammar of
Ornament ” conveys the remotest idea. Every tint is
softened, intermixed, degraded. The pinks are coralline;
the greens are tempered with verditer; the blues are of
a greenish turquoise, like the western half of an autumnal
evening sky.

Later on, when we returned to Philae from the Second
Cataract, the Writer devoted the best part of three days
to making a careful study of a corner of this portico;
patiently matching those subtle variations of tint, and
endeavouring to master the secret of their combination.1

1 The famous capitals are not the only specimens of admirable
colouring in Philae. Among the battered has-reliefs of the great
colonnade at the south end of the island, there yet remain some
isolated patches of uninjured and very lovely ornament. See, more
