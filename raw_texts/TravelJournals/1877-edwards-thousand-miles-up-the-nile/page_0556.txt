describes the king not only as beloved of Ammon, but as
Rameses beloved of Hathor, of Thoth, of Horus—in

Temple.

WEST WALL.1

The West, or principal wall, facing the entrance, is
divided into two large subjects, each
containing two ﬁgures the size of
life. In the division to the right,
Rameses II. worships Ra; in the divi-

Ra; thus following the order observed
in the other two temples, where the

 

subjects relating to Ammon Ra occupy . _ _ .
the left half, and the subjects relating l
to Ra occupy the right half, of each I;

 

structure. An upright ensign sur-

river; but the present monument, as it is turned slightly southward
round the angle of the rock, really stands S.E. by E., instead of east
and west like the large Temple.
