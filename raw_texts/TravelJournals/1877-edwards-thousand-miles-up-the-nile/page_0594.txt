travelling that one cannot easily turn aside from the
beaten track. The hot season is approaching; the river
is running low; the daily cost of the Dahabeeyah is
exorbitant; and in Nubia, where little or nothing can be
bought in the way of food, the dilatory traveller risks
starvation. It was something, however, to have seen
with one’s own eyes that the Nile, instead of ﬂowing for
a distance of 1200 miles unfed by any afﬂuent, had here
received the waters of a tributary.‘

To those who have a South breeze behind them, the
Temples must now follow in quick succession. We,
however, achieved them by degrees, and rejoiced when
our helpless Dahabeeyah lay within rowing reach of
anything worth seeing. Thus we pull down one day to
Maharrakeh—in itself a dull ruin; but picturesquely
desolate. Seen as one comes up the bank on landing,
two parallel rows of columns stand boldly up against the
sky, supporting a ruined entablature. In the foreground,
a few stunted. Dom-palms starve in an arid soil. The
barren desert closes in the distance.

1 “The Nile receives its last tributary, the Atbara, in Lat. 17° 42’ N.,
at the northern extremity of the peninsular tract anciently called the
island of Meroe, and thence ﬂows N. (a single stream without the
least accession) through 12 degrees of latitude; or, following its
winding course, at least 1200 miles, to the sea.”—Blaekz°e’s Imperial
Gazetteer, 1861. A careful survey of the country would probably
bring to light the dry beds of many more such tributaries as the one
described above.
