with extended arms, ﬁnger-tip to ﬁnger-tip, could barely
span it round. It casts a shadow twelve feet in breadth
—such a shadow as might be cast by a tower. The
capital that juts out so high above my head looks as if it
might have been placed there to support the heavens. It
is carved in the semblance of a full-blown lotus, and glows
with undying colours——colours that are still fresh, though
laid on by hands that have been dust these three thousand
years and more. It would take not six men, but a dozen
to measure round the curved lip of that stupendous lily.

Such are the twelve central columns. The rest (one
hundred and twenty-two in number) are gigantic too; but
smaller. Of the roof they once supported, only the beams
remain. Those beams are stones—huge monoliths1 carved
and painted, that bridge the space from pillar to pillar,
and pattern the trodden soil with bands of shadow.

1 The size of these stones not being given in any of our books, I
paced the length of one of the shadows, and (allowing for so much
more at each end as would be needed to reach to the centres of the
two capitals on which it rested) found the block above must measure
at least 25 feet in length. The measurements of the Great Hall are,
in plain ﬁgures, 170 feet in length by 329 in breadth. It contains
134 columns, of which the central twelve stand 62 feet high in the
shaft (or about 70 with the plinth and abacus), and measure 34 feet 6
inches in circumference. The smaller columns stand 42 feet 5 inches
in the shaft, and measure 28 feet in circumference. All are buried to
a depth of between six or seven feet in the alluvial deposits of between
three and four thousand annual inundations.
