M. Deveria suggests that the temple of Goornah
may here be indicated; but to this it might be objected
that Goornah is situated in the lower, and not the upper
part of Thebes; that at Goornah there are no great
colonnades and no obelisks; and that, moreover, for
some reason at present unknown to us, the erection of
obelisks seems to have been conﬁned to the Eastern
bank of the Nile. It is, however, possible that the
works here enumerated may not all have been executed
for one and the same Temple. The “sacred ediﬁce in
the upper gate of the Abode of Ammon” might be the
Temple of Luxor, which Rameses did in fact adorn
with the only obelisks we know to be his in Thebes;
the monument erected by him to his Divine Father
Ammon (evidently a new structure) would scarcely be
any other than the Ramesseum; while the “very, very
great colonnades,” which are expressly speciﬁed as
additions, would seem as if they could only belong to
the Hypostyle Hall of Karnak. The question is at all
events interesting; and it is pleasant to believe that in
the Munich statue we have not only a portrait of one who

was the city especially dedicated to Ammon. Also Apt, or Abot,
or Apetou, by some ascribed to an Indo-Gerrnanic root signifying
Abode.
