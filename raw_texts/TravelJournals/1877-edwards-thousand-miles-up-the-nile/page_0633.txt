Being an Englishman, it necessarily cost the Idle Man
an effort to realise the full force of this explanation——
an explanation which, in its sublime simplicity, epitomised
the whole system of the judicial administration of
Egyptian law. He hastened, however, to explain that
he cherished no resentment against the culprit or the
villagers, and that his only wish was to frighten them
into a due respect for travellers in general.

The Governor hereupon invited the Moodeer to
suggest a sentence; and the Moodeer—taking into
consideration, as he said, his Excellency’s lenient dispo-
sition—proposed to award to the fourteen innocent men
one month’s imprisonment each ; and to the real offender
two months’ imprisonment, with a hundred and ﬁfty
blows of the bastinado.

Shocked at the mere idea of such a sentence, the Idle
Man declared that he must have the innocent set at
liberty; but consented that the culprit, for the sake of
example, should be sentenced to the one hundred and
ﬁfty blows—the punishment to be remitted after the ﬁrst
few strokes had been dealt. Word was now given for
the prisoners to be brought in.

The gaoler marched. ﬁrst, followed. by two soldiers.
Then came the ﬁfteen prisoners—I am ashamed to write
it l—chained neck to neck in single ﬁle.

One can imagine how the Idle Man felt at this

moment.
