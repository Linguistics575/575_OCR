subjects of Ptolemaic ediﬁces. They abound at Den-
derah and Esneh, as well as at Edfoo. But at Edfoo
there are more inscriptions of a miscellaneous character
than in any Temple of Egypt; and it is precisely this
secular information that is to us so priceless. Here are
geographical lists of Nubian and Egyptian nomes, with
their principal cities, their products, and their tutelary
gods; lists of tributary provinces and princes; lists of
temples, and of the lands pertaining thereunto; lists of
canals, of ports, of lakes; kalendars of feasts and fasts ;
astronomical tables; genealogies and chronicles of the
gods; lists of the priests and priestesses of both Edfoo
and Denderah, with their names; lists also of singers
and assistant functionaries; lists of offerings, hymns,
invocations; and such a profusion of religious legends as
make of the walls of Edfoo alone a complete text-book
of Egyptian mythology.‘

No great collection of these inscriptions, like the
“Denderah” of M. Mariette, has yet been published;
but every now and then some young and enterprising
Egyptologist, such as M. Naville or M. Jacques de
Rougé, plunges for awhile into the depths of the Edfoo
mine and brings back as much precious ore as he can
carry. Some most singular and interesting details have
thus been brought to light. One inscription, for instance,

‘ Rapport :ur my Mz'ssiou m Ewﬂe. VICOM'I‘E E. DE Rouoﬁ.
