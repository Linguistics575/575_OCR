The palms of Derr and of the rich district beyond,
were the ﬁnest we saw throughout the journey. Straight
and strong and magniﬁcently plumed, they rose to an

quantities.

The trees are cultivated with strenuous industry
by the natives, and owe as much of their perfection to

separate palm is surrounded by a circular trench into
which the water is conducted by a small channel about
fourteen inches in width. Every palm-grove stands
in a network of these artiﬁcial runlets. The reservoir
from which they are supplied is ﬁlled by means of a
Sakkieh, or water-wheel—a primitive and picturesque
machine consisting of two wheels, the one set vertically
to the river and slung with a chain of pots; the other
a horizontal cog turned sometimes by a camel, but more
frequently in Nubia by a buffalo. The pots (which
go down empty, dip under the water, and come up full)
feed a 510ping trough which in some places supplies
a reservoir, and in others communicates at once with
the irrigating channels. These sakkiehs are kept
perpetually going; and are set so close just above Derr,
'that the Writer counted a line of ﬁfteen within the space
