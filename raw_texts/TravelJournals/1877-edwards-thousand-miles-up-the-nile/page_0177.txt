twelve to ﬁfteen feet in height; but in the absence of
any near object by which to scale them, I could form but
a rough guess as to' their actual dimensions. The boat
was just then going so fast, that to sketch or take notes
of the hieroglyphs was impossible. Before I could
adjust my glass they were already in the rear; and by
the time I had called the rest of the party together, they
were no longer distinguishable.

Coming back several months later, I looked for them
again, but without success; for the intense midday sun
was then pouring full upon the rocks, to the absolute
obliteration of everything like shallow detail. While
watching vainly, however, for the steles, I was com-
pensated by the unexpected sight of a colossal bas-relief
high up on the northward face of a cliff standing, so to
say, at the corner of one of those little recesses or ml:-
a’e-mc which here and there break the uniformity of the
range. The sculptural relief of this large subject was
apparently very low; but owing to the angle at which
it met the light, one ﬁgure, which could not have
measured less than eighteen or twenty feet in height,
was distinctly visible. I immediately drew L.’s attention
to the spot; and she not only discerned the ﬁgure
without the help of a glass, but believed like myself that
she could see traces of a second.

As neither the steles nor the bas-relief would seem

to have been observed by previous travellers, I may add
