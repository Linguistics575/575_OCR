it was the mummy of an Apis, then the jewels with
which it was adorned were probably the offering of the
prince at that time ruling in Memphis. If, on the con-
trary, it was the mummy of the prince, then, in order to
be buried in a place of peculiar sanctity, he probably
usurped one of the vaults prepared for the god. The
question is a curious one, and remains unsolved to this
day; but it could no doubt be settled at a glance by
Professor Owen.

Far more startling, however, than the discovery of
either Apis or jewels, was the sight seen by M.
Mariette on ﬁrst entering that long-closed sepulchral
chamber. The mine being sprung and the opening
cleared, he went in alone; and there, on the thin layer
of sand that covered the ﬂoor, he found the footprints
of the workmen who, 3700 years1 before, had laid that
shapeless mummy in its tomb and closed the doors upon
it, as they believed, for ever.

And now—for the afternoon is already waning fast—
the donkeys are brought round, and it is time to move
on. We have the site of Memphis and the famous
prostrate colossus yet to see, and the long road lies all
before us. So back we ride across the desolate sands;
and with a last, long, wistful glance at the Pyramid in
platforms, go down from the territory of the dead into
the land of the living.

‘ The date is M. Mariette’s.
