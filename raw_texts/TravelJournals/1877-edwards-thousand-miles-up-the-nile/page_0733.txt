thinks of the jewels, furniture, vases, ointments, clothing,
arms, and precious documents which were as certainly
buried in those tombs as the royal mummies for whom
they were excavated, it seems far more wonderful that
one queen and her parure should have remained undis-
covered, than that all the rest of these dead and gone
royalties should have fallen among thieves.

Of all tombs in the Valley of Bab-el-Molook, one
would rather, I think, have discovered that of Rameses
III. As he was one of the richest of the Pharaohs 1 and
an undoubted virtuoso in his tastes, so we may be sure
that his tomb was furnished with all kinds of beautiful
and precious things. What would we not give now to
ﬁnd some of those elaborate gold and silver vases, those
cushioned thrones and sofas, those bows and quivers and
shirts of mail so carefully catalogued on the walls of the
side-chambers’in the ﬁrst corridor! I do not doubt that
specimens of all these things were buried with the king
and left ready for his use. He died, believing that his
soul would come back after long cycles of probation, and

make its home once more in the mummied body. He

of great riches in silver, indeed, to such an amount that none of the
princes, his successors, surpassed or even equalled his wealth.”—
HERODOTUS, book ii. chap. 121.
