On the threshold of this tremendous portal we again
dismounted. Shapeless crude-brick mounds, marking
the limits of the ancient wall of circuit, reached far away
on either side. An immense perspective of pillars and
pylons leading up to a very distant obelisk opened out
before us. We went in, the great walls towering up
like cliffs above our heads, and entered the First Court.
Here, in the midst of a large quadrangle open to the
sky, stands a solitary column, the last of a central avenue
of twelve, some of which, disjointed by the shock, lie
just as they fell, like skeletons of vertebrate monsters
left stranded by the Flood.

Crossing this Court in the glowing sunlight, we came
to a mighty doorway between two more propylons—the
doorway splendid with coloured has-reliefs; the propylons
mere cataracts of fallen blocks piled up to right and left
in grand confusion. The cornice of the doorway is gone.
Only a jutting fragment of the lintel stone remains.
That stone, when perfect, measured forty feet and ten
“inches across. The doorway must have been full a
hundred feet in height.

We went on. Leaving to the right a mutilated
colossus engraven on arm and breast with the cartouche of
Rameses II., we crossed the shade upon the threshold, and
passed into the famous Hypostyle Hall of Seti the First.
