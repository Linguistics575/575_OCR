At the upper end of this wall is depicted a life-sized
female Ô¨Ågure wearing an elaborate blue head-dress

corresponding to the portrait of Rameses on the opposite
wall. Near her stands a table of offerings, on which,
among other objects, are placed four vases of a rich blue
colour traversed by bands of yellow. They perhaps

Each of these vases contains an object like a pine, the
ground-colour of which is deep yellow, patterned over
with scale-like subdivisions in vermilion. We took
them to represent grains of maize pyramidally piled.

Lastly, a pendant to that on the Opposite wall, comes

with its prow towards the east; and it rests upon an
altar, in the centre of which are the cartouches of

description, dating from the eighteenth dynasty; see Case E, Seamd
Egyptzim Room. They are of dark blue translucent glass, veined with
waving lines of opaque white and yellow.
