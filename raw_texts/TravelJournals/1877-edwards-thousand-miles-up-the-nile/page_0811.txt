This date falls in the interval which lies between the years 3010 and 3007
I before our era. M. de Saulcy has veriﬁed the calculations of M. Chabas,
{ and ﬁnds them exact. Hence we are enabled to attach a deﬁnite date to the
! epoch of the construction of the great pyramids, and Mena will belong, as

other calculations have already led us to suppose, to the XLth century before
Christ.

THE END.
