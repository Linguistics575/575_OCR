9 inches; area, 535,824 square feet}l That is to say, it
stands I I 5 feet 9 inches higher than the cross on the top
of St. Paul’s, and about 20 feet lower than Box Hill in
Surrey, and if transported bodily to London, would a
little more than cover the whole area of Lincoln’s Inn
Fields. These are sufﬁciently matter-of- fact statements,
and sufﬁciently intelligible; but, like most calculations of
the kind, they diminish rather than do justice to the dig-
nity of the subject.

More impressive by far than the weightiest array of
ﬁgures or the most striking comparisons was the shadow
cast by the Great Pyramid as the sun went down. That
mighty Shadow, sharp and distinct, stretched across the
stony platform of 'the desert and over full three-quarters
of a mile of the green plain'below. It divided the sun-
light where it fell, just as its great original divided the
sunlight in the upper air; and it darkened the space it
covered, like an eclipse. It was not without a thrill of
something approaching to awe that one remembered
how this self—same Shadow had gone on registering not
only the height of the most stupendous gnomon ever set
up by human hands, but the slow passage, day by day,
of more than sixty centuries of the world's history.

1 Colonel Howard Vyse gives the Great Pyramid 14 feet more in
the length of the side, and IO feet 9 inches more in perpendicular
height. It is difﬁcult to understand how two such careful observers can
have arrived at such diﬂ’erent results.
