here and there with arrowy ﬂashes of the Nile. Farthest
of all, pale but distinct, on the outermost rim of the
world, rise two mountain summits, one long, one dome-
like. Our N ubians tell us that these are the mountains
of Dongola. Comparing our position with that of the
Third Cataract as it appears upon the map, we come to
the conclusion that these ghost-like silhouettes are the
summits of Mount ~Fogol and Mount Arambo—two
apparently parallel mountains situated on Opposite sides
of the river about ten miles below Hannek, and conse-
quently about 145 miles, as the bird ﬂies, from the spot
on which we are standing.

In all this extraordinary panorama, so wild, so weird,
so desolate, there is nothing really beautiful, except the
colour. But the colour is transcendent. Never, even
in Egypt, have I seen anything so tender, so trans-
parent, so harmonious. I shut my eyes, and it all comes
before me. I see the amber of the sands; the pink and
pearly mountains; the Cataract rocks, all black and
'purple and polished; the dull gray palms that cluster
here and there upon the larger islands; the vivid ver-
dure of the tamarisks and pomegranates; the Nile, a
greenish brown ﬂecked with yeasty foam; over all, the
blue and burning sky, permeated with light, and palpi-
tating with sunshine.

‘ Mount Fogo, as shown upon Keith Johnston’s map of Egypt and
Nubia, would seem to be identical with the Ali Bersi of Lepsius.
