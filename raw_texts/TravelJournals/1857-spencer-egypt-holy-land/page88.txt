DATE OF THE PYRAMIDS. 61

Ussher, or the ordinary Bible chronology,) gives the date of
Joseph’s death BC. 1635, and expresses the opinion that
the Pyramids were built, or rather commenced, about forty
years subsequently, i. e., BC. 1595. Rollin also follows
Ussher’s scheme, and gives the date of the pyramid builders
as BC. 1204, i. e., about three hundred years after the Ex-
odus. Dr. Richardson, as quoted by Col. Vyse, dates them
as low as BC. 1032. A later school, more particularly the
German, is disposed to give them even greater antiquity than
is done by any of the writers above quoted. Bockh, as quoted
by Dr. Nolan, (in his learned “Egyptian Chronology Ana-
lyzed”) makes Suphis I. to have been of the fourth dynasty,
RC. 4904; Suphis II. 13.0. 4842; Mencheres, BC. 4776.
Chevalier Bunsen, who is understood to agree with Lepsius
in all important matters, is of opinion that there are existing
Egyptian monuments (the Pyramids are among the oldest, if
not the oldest,) which date back more than BC. 3000* Mr.
Gliddom‘ (in his “Otia Egyptiaoa,” 1849,) speaks rather
vaguely, but has no hesitation in carrying back the date of
the Pyramids to more than 5000 years ago, or to about BC.
3500. Champollion-Figeacl places the invasion of the Hyk-
sos, or Shepherd-Kings, about 13.0.2000, and quotes from
Manetho’s list of Egyptian Dynasties the era of Suphis, Sen-
saouphis and Mencheres, about B.C. 5000—4800. The re-
sult then is as follows :—
The highest date claimed is (about) 13.0. 4900.

The lowest date assigned is N “ 1200.
The most probable date is “ “ 2100.

1' “ All the Memphite pyramids existed and were ancient 2000 years before
Christ. All the pyramids in Lower Egypt are 4000 years old, and taking the
pyramid of Moeris, according to Lepsius’ letters, built between 2151 and 2194
before Christ, as the last ofthis series the remainder will successively recede to
above 5000 years ano. ”—Gliddon’ s “ Olin. Egyptica,” p. 25.
