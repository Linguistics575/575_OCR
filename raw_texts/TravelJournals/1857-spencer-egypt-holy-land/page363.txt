334 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.-

entitled to our notice for the reasons which we believe it is:
yes, it is possible that the wall might have so run as to ex-
clude the Holy Sepulchre, and yet Mr. Fergusson’s bold the-
ory be true, that tradition has wrongly ﬁxed it where it is,
notwithstanding the clear tradition of the ﬁrst three centu-

Romans, though there is no reason to suppose that the unim-
portant localities of Calvary and the tomb in the rock
received material injury; most of the disciples had ﬂed pre-

after the mournful overthrow of Jerusalem, they returned to
