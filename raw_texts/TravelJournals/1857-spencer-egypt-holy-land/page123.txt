96 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

in speaking of Dendera, acknowledges that the style of the
ﬁgures is graceless, the hieroglyphics profuse and ill-adjusted,
the columns, looked at singly, heavy, perhaps barbarous, in
appearance, and the walls tediously long and unrelieved; and
though this language may appear too strong, as applied to
Philae, I am persuaded that, in substance, one feels that in
these respects Egyptian architecture,-as we now see it in
ruins, is vastly inferior to that which prevailed in Greece
and the West of Europe in later days. At the same time, it
is but just to recollect that we see everything under the great-
est possible disadvantages, and, as the learned author of
“ Modern Egypt and Thebes” very properly says, “a temple
did not present the same monotonous appearance (which it
now does) when the painted sculptures were in their original
state; and it was the necessity of relieving the large expanse
of ﬂat wall that led to this rich mode of decoration.” But
however this may be, no one can look upon the richness of
coloring which still exists, without astonishment; so balmy
is the climate of Egypt, so remarkably free from dampness or
moisture, and so well suited to the preservation of works of
art, that to one who comes from a land of cold and storms, it
seems well nigh impossible that he can be gazing upon deco-
rations thousands of years old. Over head, he looks upon a
ceiling representing the clear blue sky, bespangled with stars,
and so fresh and brilliant are the colors, that it needs no par-
ticularly vivid fancy to imagine that the scene is veritably be-
fore him, and that the artist has not long since left the work
which he has completed. On the walls and columns, over
the pyla and throughout the temple, he sees the green, and
red, and yellow, and other colors used in adorning the sculp-
tures, and in them too he recognizes the same brightness and
beauty, and hardly knows whether most to admire these, or
mourn over the desolation which the ruins as a whole present.

You will readily understand, my dear S., with what inter-
est I spent a considerable time in one of the large apartments
