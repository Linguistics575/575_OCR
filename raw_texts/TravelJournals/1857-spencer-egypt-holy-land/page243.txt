216 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

than four hours, and being very much fatigued with the length
and monotony of the services. I will confess to you that I.
was disappointed with what I saw and heard, and am not
able to express any very great hopes of the increase of pure
religion among the Copts, while their public services are so
apparently inoperative and listened to and joined in so much
as a mere matter of form. But I express this opinion with'
no particular conﬁdence, since I do not esteem myself ‘ sufﬁ-
ciently acquainted with the people and their actual condition,
to judge accurately. Perhaps time, and the inﬂuence of the.
labors of missionaries among them, may produce all that we
could hope or desire.*

Having spoken above of the Coptic patriarch, a person of
some note in the East, you will perhaps allow me to say a
Word or two of some other residents of Cairo, who occupy po-
sitions of no little importance in public estimation. The old
pasha, Mohammed Ali, I have seen a number of times, -rid~

Muslim Egyptians (fellahin and towns-people) . 1,750,000

Christian “ (Copts) . . . . . 150,000
Osmanlis, or Turks . . . . . . 10,000
Syrians . ; . . . . . . . 5,000
Greeks . . . . . . . . . 5,000
Armenians . . . . . . . . 2,000
Jews . . 5,000

Western Arabs, Nubians, Negroes, Franks, &c., (about) 70,000

In Cairo he estimates the Mohammedans, about 190,000; the Copts, about
10,000; the Jews, 3000 or 4000; strangers from various countries, about 36,000.
In the times of the Pharaohs, Egypt appears to have had a population of about
7,000,000; and Mr. Lane is of opinion that the country could readily yield
enough, under proper care and cultivation, to support 8,000,000 inhabitants.—
