NAZARETH, April 22d, 1849.
MY DEAR 8.,

MY last letter Was ﬁnished in a very great hurry, as I
fear you have discovered ere this; but there was no alterna-
tive. I must write when I can, and, though I am am sensi-
ble that I do it under great disadvantages, still as I have
promised to let you hear from me at certain intervals, and
as, perhaps, the necessity of writing rapidly and in great
measure without books to consult, may be more than com-
pensated for by the fact that I give you just what I see, and
hear, and feel, without reference to the speculations and
theories of the learned or the critical, you will, I am sure,
take what I send you for what it is worth, and give me your
attention still further even to the end of my lucubrations.
