212 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

Various pictures——if so I may call these miserable daubs—
are afﬁxed to the walls in different places, and over the chan-
cel partition are representations of the Saviour and the Apos-
tles. As in the Greek Church, pictures are allowed to any
extent, but images of every description are positively prohib-

they were now quite dirty, and very carelessly put on, they
appeared to me rather shabby than otherwise: the other
priests, who were stationed apparently without any regard to
order, near the chancel door or in its vicinity, were in novrn'se
to be distinguished by their dress, from the members of their
congregation; neither had the patriarch anything peculiar to
his ofﬁce, so far as his garments were concerned, which were
precisely the same as he had .on when I saw him some days
ago.

As I was known to be a priest, my young Abyssinian
friend conducted me through the compartments to the front
of the chancel, and near the patriarch’s chair, ,where, pro-
vided with a seat which he brought for the purpose, I could
