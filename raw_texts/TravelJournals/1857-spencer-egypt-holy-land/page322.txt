in ,unrestrained freedom. But see; there is a little girl who
isthrowing stones at us; and Why ?' do you suppose: let us
ask the reason, if'reason there be, “What do you mean by
throwing stones at us 7” the answer comes quickly and
pertly';-—.-“\vhat do you want by looking at us as you did?
and if you don’t go away and not look where we are, we
will throw more stones at you, you Christian dogs.” Such
is the spirit breathed into the young by the , bigotted and fa-
natical Mohammedans, Tommaso is excessively indignant,
and returns their abuse in kind if not in amount; but we
,can‘well afford to pass it by, and continue our upward walk.
We meet but very few persons, and were we to judge by these
evidences of life and activity round about. the Holy City, we
should see and feel, most deeply, how true it is, that she is
trodden down and desolate. Instead of the busy hundreds
and thousands moving to and fro, engaged in their daily oc-
cupations, we see only single individuals, or occasional small
parties; instead of the distant hum and noise of a populous
city, not a sound is heard, and stillness like that of the grave
broods over everything ;—

“ No martial myriads muster in thy gate ;

No suppliant nations in thy Temple wait;
No prophet bards, thy glittering courts among;
Wake the full lyre, and swell the tide of song; ,
But lawless force, and meagre want are there,
And the quick darting eye of restless fear,
While cold oblivion, ’mid the ruins laid,

. Folds his dank wing beneath the ivy shade :”*.—.

And when we stand still for a few moments, and look around
us, how dreary seems the scene, and how true and exact the
words of prophetic denunciations against the wickedness and
rebellion of the people.

We here ﬁnd the ruins of a large ediﬁce, the scant re-
mains of what tradition informs us was the church built by the

. . * Bishop Heber's “ Palestine."
