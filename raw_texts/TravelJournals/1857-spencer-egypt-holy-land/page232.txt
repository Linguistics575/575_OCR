AN ORIENTAL BATH. 205

thing, we entered through a small, low door, into a large,
square apartment, in most respects like the outer one, having
seats or diwans, being paved, etc.; in the centre of the’ room
is a fountain of hot water, which keeps it ﬁlled with hot va-
por, and“ very soon throws one into a profuse perspiration.
Here a one-eyed Arab, like myself with only a napkin round
his Joins, took me in charge, and depriving me of the clogs,
led me up several steps into a small adjoining chamber, to
undergo the ﬁrst process in an oriental bath. A tank of
(water, hot enough to scald one if introduced suddenly into it,
is in the middle of this chamber, and the vapor or hot air is so
ﬁlled with moisture, that it is only by the gradual approach
which one makes in getting to this point, that he ﬁnds him-

laughing at my white skin, and he passed his witticisms—at '
least he thought them such—to some acquaintance of tawny
hue who was' amusing himself in the tank of hot water, and
between them I underwent a rather severe wordy castigation.
When the rubbing was over, though I did not much relish
the idea, I was prevailed upon ﬁrst to dip my feet into the
scalding water, and then boldly to plunge into the steaming
caldron up to my very neck. 0 it was curious to see what
the human body is capable of, and what pleasure may be
found in a tank of hot water, provided one be not plunged
into it too suddenly; I assure you I enjoyed it immensely.
Leaving this apartment, I was taken into another, also small,
