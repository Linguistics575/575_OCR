12 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

would be astonished, I was, at their light-heartedness, their
patient endurance of fatigue and want, their noisy merri-

produce, and remaining as long as they please, without an
effort on the part of mother or child to drive them away.
Hour after hour they sit, or lie, or play listlessly about in
