448 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

we loved to gaze with a fondness that home only can inspire.
It was near sunset when we ﬁrst looked upon this splendid
panorama, and we could not forbear standing in silence near
the neglected wely of Neby Ismail and watching the glorious
orb of day as gradually it sank behind Carmel’s Mount and
kissed the blue waters of the Great Sea. Nay, so attractive
