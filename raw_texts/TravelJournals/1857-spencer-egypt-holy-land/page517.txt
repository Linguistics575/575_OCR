488 EGYPT AND THE ‘HOLY LAND.

Such, gentle reader, were the concluding words of the last
letter written in the Holy Land. Our wanderings extended
no further than to the neighborhood of Beirut; Damascus,
Lebanon, Baalbeck, and other points of interest which lie
along the shore of Palestine, we were compelled to omit.
Imperative circumstances called Mr. P. and myself home-
-ward, and within a day or two after the above was written
we left Beirut in the French steamer for Alexandria. For
six days, we lay in the harbor of that city waiting for the
Overland mail; and on the evening of May 16th, we arrived
at Malta, in company with our friends, Dr. Wainwright and
Mr. Minturn; here we performed five days’ quarantine in
the pleasant and well-provided lazaretto attached to this
important naval station. On the 22d ult., we embarked
again, and parting with our friends at Civita Vecchia, we
visited Rome, crossed the Alps, went through Switzerland,
down the Rhine, and so to England. Mr. P. took the
steamer and reached home sooner than I did. On the 2d of
July, I embarked from London, in the packet ship Westmin-
ster, and after a rather long passage, on Friday, the 10th of
August, I was restored in safety, and with renewed health
and vigor, to my family and friends. To God’s Holy Name
be ascribed all the praise and glory for this and all other in-
stances of His compassion and goodness.
