THE ans’ PLACE OF WAILING. 279

the temptations to embrace Christianity from motives other
than those of honest conviction, are so peculiar, that unusual
watchfulness is needed, and a long course of disciplinary in-
struction absolutely demanded. Consequently, the mission
does not number many who have been brought to a knowledge
of their guilt and error; but those who are catechumens, and
those who have been baptized, are, I believe, really and truly
turned from the error of their ways, and earnestly desirous to
know and believe the truths of the Gospel. I am sure, then,
that though you may not participate in my doubts or hesita-

place comprising about a hundred feet of the west wall of
the Haram, not far from its southern boundary, and one

must be very touching to the feelings of the despised and
down-trodden remnant of Israel, who here weekly assemble
towail and mourn over the desolation and downfall'of J ud'ah.
I preferred not to go on a Friday, deeming it t00 much” of an
intrusion upon their grief, which deserves respect, at least, at
our hands; so, taking another day, I went to look at this
spot, and to gaze upon the remains of the wall which Dr. Rob-
inson and others attribute to the era of Solomon; and if I
may venture an opinion, not without reason. The massive
stones,.of themselves alone, point back to a period of great
antiquity, and unless we refer the erection of so grand a
work to the time of Solomon, I know not when, or by Whom,
