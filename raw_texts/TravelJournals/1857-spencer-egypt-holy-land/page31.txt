4 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

ing with all his might, and calling aloud to any one and
every one in a medley of tongues, partly in English, a little
in French, with a few words of Italian, or German, or some-
thing else. To a spectator unacquainted with the habits of
these people, it would appear that they were quarrelling
very furiously, and liable at any moment to come to blows,
so eager are they, so active and energetic in endeavoring
to recommend their boats, and so full of liveliness and noisy
good humor in pushing and jumping about and getting
hold of the luggage of travellers. Happily we were relieved
of the annoyance of personal attendance upon our multifari-
ous collection of luggage, since our Maltese servant, an ac-
tive fellow by the way, had been to Egypt before, and spoke
Arabic sufﬁciently well to manage all such matters as these ;*
and we were at liberty to observe and—so ill-natured are
mankind—to be amused with the perplexities of our fellow-
passengers. Such a Babel of tongues, such a chaos of lug-

pet-bags or small parcels, calling out almost in frenzy for a
missing trunk or portmanteau, rousing the ire of the French
sailors and servants, seizing hold of some bare-legged Arab
who is making off with part of the luggage, and at last
giving up all in desperation, determined to take one’s chance
and let bags and baggage go as they may,—such an odd
scene of confusion I do not know that I ever witnessed.
After a While, however, we made our way through the noisy
crowd, and depositing ourselves in the midst of a boat full of
articles which we had brought with us, we were rowed along,
at a slow pace, through the merchant vessels, a large num-
ber of which were lying at anchor in the harbor, and in ﬁfteen
minutes’ time were set down in front of a dirty white-colored

* The striking afﬁnity between the dialect ofthe Maltese and the Arabic has
engaged the attention of several eminent scholars, and deserves further investi
