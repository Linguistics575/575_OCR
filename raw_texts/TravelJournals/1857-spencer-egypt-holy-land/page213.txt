186 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

Notice, now, for a moment, what is passing before-our
eyes; crowds of people are constantly moving along, some
having come to buy, and some merely to look ; different cries
are shouted in our ears by those who vend articles about the
streets; women of the lower classes are haggling with the
shop-keeper about seine triﬂing purchase; ladies in silks and

where not only the bijouterie attracts their attention, but
something else in the merchant himself, a circumstance
which strikingly reminds one of the Arabian Nights, and the

of the shops are empty, the master having left his property to
the care of his neighbors, who in general thus aid one another;
in one or two places the merchant is very devout, and is say-

bazaar, we see that a great variety of articles are on sale;
such as ready-made clothes, arms of different descriptions and
qualities, the seggadehs or prayer-carpets, silks, linens, mus-
lins, amber mouth-pieces, pipes, copper-ware, &c. (550.

Let us see if we can make a bargain for an article of dress
which I expect to use in going into Syria; it will serve to
illustrate the oriental manner of buying and selling, which is
in some respects very diverse from our own. I wish for a
burnoos or heavy capote, and in a shop close at hand I see
several exposed to View: we stop at an old acquaintance’s,
