372 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

season for Mohammedan pilgrirnages, we met great numbers
of persons going'and returning from Jerusalem. They uni-
formly regarded us with savage looks, while all the Jews
and Christians whom we saw saluted us warmly.

“We left Hebron between two and three o’clock, and in
about half an hour arrived at the Tree of Abraham, a mag-
niﬁcent cak,'eertainly one of the ﬁnest trees I have ever
seen. According to Derobins‘on, the trunk measures twenty-
two and a half feet around its lower part. It is called in
Arabic, Sindiz‘m. Leaving the tree, we made the best of our
way over the same road back to the Pools of Solomon,
which we reached just at nightfall. We met a great number
of persons during the day, almost all of whom were armed;
indeed every peasant at his plough wore at least a sword, or
carried a war-club. From the Pools our road was direct to
Bethlehem. ’We arrived at the gate of the Latin Convent
abdut half-past seven in the evening. The principal gate
WbS‘clo'sed, but after some parleying, we were admitted by a
side door, and assigned a very clean and comfortable room
Vinnthat’pa'rt of the convent generally occupied by travellers.
We were ”served at our evening meal by 'an Italian monk;
and, thanks to the good acéommodations allotted us, we
passed a very comfortable night.”
