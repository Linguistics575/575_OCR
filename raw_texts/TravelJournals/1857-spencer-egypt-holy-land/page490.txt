THE ROAD NORTH FROM AKKA. 461

tail its history, and on the spot called up the events to which
its name points; we should have been glad to have looked
away back to the period when it was called Accho, and when
the tribe of Asher did not succeed in expelling its inhabitants ;
to have mused over its history under the Roman sway, after it
had received the new title, Ptolemais, and was visited by the
great Apostle to the Gentiles; to have given play to the en-
thusiasm which the Crusaders’ chivalrous deeds excite, when
the possession of Acre was esteemed so all-important, and con-
tended for so many years: but the present was not the ﬁtting
time for these things, and so we turned away from Akka and
resumed our journey. As we rode over the fertile plain
which extends back some distance from the sea, we noticed a
pretty country palace of the pasha, situate amid the trees,
and very attractive in appearance, as well as many other
rural residences, gardens, &c. The well-built and extensive
aqueduct which supplies Akka with water was a very inter-
esting object, and occupied our attention for some time; as
much so, at. least, as the rain would permit. With occasional
sunshine, and noticing here and there villages in the distance,
we rode along not far from the sea-shore; passed Ez-Zib, sit-
uate on an ascent by the water’s side, and probably identical
in site with the Achzib mentioned in Joshua, xix. 29, and the
Book of Judges, i. 31, and called afterwards Ecdippa ; had a
good View of the village of Bussah, a little to the right, at
the base of the hills, and in the midst of fertile ﬁelds and
abundanceof trees; were struck with the lone appearance of
a large column on the hill-side, but too far off for us to dis-
tinguish its object or character ; and arrived at Ras en-Nakura,
about four o’clock, where the plain of Akka may be said to
terminate, and the hills almost to touch the very sea-side.
We mounted the lofty and rugged hill, and though it was
early, determined to pitch our tent, and pass the night in this
airy position. The prospect was very ﬁne from the point we
had chosen, and it aﬂbrded us no little pleasure to look back
