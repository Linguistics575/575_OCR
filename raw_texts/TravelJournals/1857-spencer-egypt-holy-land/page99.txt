72 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

tediousness, monotony, and tendency to produce ennui; and,
indeed, I am not surprised that such should be the case; for
the rules of society in our advanced stage of civilization, are
imagined, or found to be so full of restraint upon the exuber-

cushions to sit or lean upon—one of the pleasantest spots on
board; next we enter the cabin proper, which is about six and
a half feet high, by nine broad, and seven long, with divans on
each side to lounge upon in the day-time, and repose oneself dur-
ing the long evening and night. After this principal apart-
ment, which serves for our dining-room, our place of reading or
writing, or anything else we choose, comes a second division
of the space devoted to our use, with a narrow passage be-
