434 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

and Saracen hosts ;—its connection with these I need not
enlarge upon, much'as I should desire to tell you of the
many reﬂections and musings to which this famous city
gave rise in our minds, while we were journeying over the
plain. Neither may I now stop to dwell upon Solam, the
ancient Shunem, near to which on our right we passed, at a
quarter past ten o’clock; though the prophet’s miraculous
power here displayed might well induce us to pause; nor

whole force of the Turkish army, amounting to at least
twenty-ﬁve thousand. To those who admire such things it
must have been a grand sight to witness the brave French-
men, drawn up into a square, ﬁghting from sunrise to mid-

Napoleon, dashing over the plain with a few hundred men to
his aid ; to mark the panic, precipitate ﬂight and total rout
of the Turks; to trace the rapid steps of that great warrior
who, after this exploit, dined at Nazareth, and returned the
same day to Akka; and such like; but I love not to dwell
upon these things, especially when so near the very spot
