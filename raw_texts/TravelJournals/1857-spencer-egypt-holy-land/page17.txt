and that they ought never to have been dragged forth, through the un-

trusts, that they are not unworthy attention, as coming from one who
has spoken honestly and straight-forwardly; as being free from exag-
geration, aﬂ'ectation, or a captions spirit; and as treating of matters
deeply important and interesting to all; then he will not doubt, that
even a new book on the East Will be received with indulgent favor; and .
he will have the satisfaction of knowing, that he has not lived and

written altogether in vain.
