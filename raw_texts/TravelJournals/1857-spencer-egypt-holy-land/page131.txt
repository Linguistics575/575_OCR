104 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

do not intend here, to detain you with any description of this'
remnant of early days; it is sufﬁcient to quote the words of
Wilkinson, Who says: “The imposing style of its architec-

for elegance and massive grandeur. It was cleared out to
the ﬂoor by order of Mohammed Ali, during his visit to

discountenanced Wherever it exists; or Why a man’s morals
and. principles should not be held as sacred and as binding in
the East as in the West. If I could so far have forgotten
what was due to the virtuous female, as to have gone to see
