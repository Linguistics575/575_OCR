TRADITIONS on NAZARETH. 445

directly in our road, and when we came near to it, a pictur-
esque scene met our eyes. The young maidens of the village,
,clad in gay attire, and laughing merrily, had come out to the
hunt for water ; they ﬁlled their jars, placed them on
their heads, and looking pleasantly at the strangers, walked
away, erect, of ﬁne forms, and some of them possessing beau-
tiful features. In justice to ourselves, I must mention, that
the same idea respecting the people of this region, had occur-
red to others of our friends, whom we have met at the Casa
Nuova of the Latin convent; and they quite agree with us,
that the Christian village, or city of Nazareth, is vastly more
agreeable than any into which they have been since they left
the Holy City :* if it be a delusion, it is at least a harmless
and pleasant one, and it served to render more tolerable the
excessive fatigues of this long and hot day’s journeyings.

I shall not weary you, my dear 8., with dwelling upon
many of the mere idle traditions in and about Nazareth: it
needs not that I tell you of the reputed work-shop of Joseph,
the carpenter, where our Saviour is supposed to have wrought
,at the same trade; of the large block of stone, which report
says was the table on which He ate with His disciples; of
the garden in which He is said to have taken special delight
when a boy; and many more: I shall pass them all over;
and as my letter has already reached to a great length, I
shall simply speak of one or two matters of real interest, and
then close the present epistle. We have been privileged to
spend the Lord’s Day here in this interesting town, and as
there was an English clergyman present, we had the services
of the church quietly to ourselves, in the large room appro-
priated to the uses of strangers and travellers. Later in the
day, we visited the Church of the Annunciation, built over
the supposed grottotL where the angel was sent to announce

‘ The population of Nazareth is about three thousand, perhaps more; of
these three-fourths are Christians.
