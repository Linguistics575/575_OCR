130 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

researches into hiermjlyphicsi'since the days of Champollion,
have enabled us to macertain with precision to whom the
Colossi belong, and as Sir G. Wilkinson declares, “ Amunoph
once more asserts his claims to the statues he erected.” .

I had thought'of inﬂicting upon you some of the Greek-
and Latin inscriptions on the legs and feet of the colossus, to
show you how learned a man can be on very small means.
Ltook the trouble of copying several of these, by way of
amusement, andI doubt not I could display considerable eru-
dition in throwing light upon the plain and simple parts, as
well as in judiciously gliding in silence over the real difﬁcul-
ties—no uncommon plan, by the by—but I spare you all
this, and shall leave the inscriptions to rest in peace in the
“ Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature.” Let me
hope that, considering the tmvﬁetiom my forbearance will
not go unappreciated.
