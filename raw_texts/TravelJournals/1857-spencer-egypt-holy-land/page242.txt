THE COMMUNION SERVICE IN cop'rrc. 215

of different colors laid near each hand, standing in front ‘of
the altar, with his back to the‘people, went through a very
long consecration service in Coptic, frequently bowing and
prostrating himself, and not venturing to touch the bread
with his hands, except in one or two instances. I could not
see that the wine was included in the service of consecration,
