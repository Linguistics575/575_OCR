SCENES IN THE WILDERNESS. 237

‘We would, on such occasions, spread our seggadeh upon the
clean sand, and Antonio having set before us a cold chicken,
or something of the sort, with some dates, oranges, 8220., we
would enjoy our repast as well as the burning sun would ad-
mit, and would quench our thirst, as best we might, with
the dark reddish colored water which was carried in Ieathern
buckets attached to our camels’ sides. Remounting again,
we pressed onward with renewed vigor ; now, one after anoth-
er new or strange thing met our view. Here and there, we
beheld some groves of palms which looked doubly refreshing
and attractive in the midst of the waste and dreary desert on
all sides : occasionally some dome—covered tomb of a sheikh or
Mohammedan saint, served to add variety to the scene: 'very
frequently, we came upon the carcasses and bones of some
poor camels which had dropped down with fatigue or thirst,
and had been abandoned to the vulture and beasts of prey
that watch unceasingly the track of caravans in the desert:
and at such times we thought of the touching lines of the
poet :—
“ In silent horror o’er the boundless waste
:- The driver Hassan with his camels past;
One cruise ofwater on his back he bore,
And his light scrip contained a scanty store;
The sultry sun hath gain’d the middle sky,

And not a tree, and not an herb was nigh;
Shrill roar’d the winds, and dreary was the view .
“ ‘ Ye mute companions of my toils, that bear

In all my griefs a more than equal share!

Here, where no springs in murmurs break away,

Or moss-crowned fountains mitigate the day,

In vain ye hope the green delights to knowI

Which plains more blest, or verdant vales, bestow;

Here rocks alone, and tasteless sands are found,

And faint and sickly winds forever howl around.
Sad was the hour, and luckiess was the day,
When ﬁrst from Shiraz’ walls I bent my way!’ "“
