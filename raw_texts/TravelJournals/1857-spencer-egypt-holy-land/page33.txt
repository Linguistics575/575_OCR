6- EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND;

crowded with mysterious monuments of long-forgotten ages.
I have endeavored, and I shall endeavor, to look at everything
which is presented before me with care, as far as may be
apart from prejudice, and with the distinct recollection, that
God rules in the affairs of men, according to His good pleas-
ure ; and to the best of my ability I shall try to place before
you the present condition of things, and the actual, veritable
life, manners, customs, habits, &c., of the people among
whom I am now sojourning. I do not hope to approach the

visit to the East: and while I beg you to pardon me for
having dwelt so long upon this point, I promise you, that,
with this understanding as to my purpose and expectations,
I will here dismiss the subject entirely.

Alexandria, or as the Arabs term it, El-Iskandz'rie/L, as

gone through many and various changes, since the period
