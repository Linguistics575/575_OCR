OUR Leno’s CRUCIFIXION. 327

which they had cruelly forced Him to bear on His shoulder,
he was relieved from carrying it by Simon of Cyrene, who
chanced to be passing by, and was compelled to take it; ere
long they came to the wall, on the. western side of the city;
they emerged through the gate, and shortly after came to the
hilly spot or eminence, apparently used for executionsﬁ“ and
named Calvary or Golgotha; the Saviour was nailed to the
cross, which was here set up, and on either hand the two
malefactors were placed: this was the third hour, answering
to our nine o’clock, or thereabouts; during the following three
hours, the Saviour endured the agony of the cross, and the
horrid mockings and insults of the infuriate Jews, and was
looked upon by multitudes, as well from the walls of the city
near by, as from the vicinity of the cross; from noon until
three o’clock, the whole land was enveloped in darkness and

derived from the form of the rocky hill, i. e., from its resemblance to a skull. I

has always struck me as a difﬁculty not easily explained, that the wealthy Jo—
seph should have a garden in immediate proximity to the ordinary place of ex-

ecution. The majority of scholars and divines, however, take the opposite
view.
