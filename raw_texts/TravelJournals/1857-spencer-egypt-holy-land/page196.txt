INTERESTING GROTTO. 169

and beaten upon the shoulders instead of the feet. Now, the
artist presents before us the various exciting scenes of war,
and now, the more agreeable domestic avocations of every-day
life: the scribes register for their master the accounts of his
estates, and present them with the vouchers to him whom they
serve : the women play on the harp, or they are engaged in pre-
paring bread and delicacies: the servants are occupied in catch-

Egyptians, not far from four thousand years ago. I suppose,
in all, we visited about ﬁfteen, or perhaps more of these grot-

their respective fancies dictated. But it would be useless to
attempt a detailed account of all that we beheld: I shall

ference, and about ﬁfteen feet in height, slightly decreasing
in thickness towards the upper end of the shaft, and crowned
with an abacus, exceeding but little the summit of the column.
The doorway or entrance is large, and only a few feet from
the columns in front; it is covered with hieroglyphics, both
in front and on its sides. The chamber itself I found to be
nearly forty feet square, with a recess or niche opposite the
doorway: there are four large columns, with sixteen sides

or faces, similar to those just spoken of, placed at even dis-
