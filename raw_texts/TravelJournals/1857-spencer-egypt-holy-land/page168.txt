GRANDEUR OF THE HALL OF ASSEMBLY. 141

the heads and faces present, especially those of the female
ﬁgures; but what strangely ill-proportioned persons many
of these have :* observe how nearly the artist apprOached to
the perspective, and yet how sadly deﬁcient his work is from
ignorance of that important point in art; and particularly
notice the prominence given "to a religious view of all sub-
jects, in the constant introduction of the gods and god-
desses, the offerings made to them, and. the hieroglyphics
expressing the adoration of the deities, and the care of the
kings to promote their Worship and honor. Look, too, at
the walls of this grand hall or chamber, and remembering
that the king in Whose reign it was erected lived some three
thousand two hundred and thirty years ago, note the fresh-
ness and beauty of the colors, the bright blue, the dazzling
vermilion, the pale green, the lovely yellow, and many others:
does it not seem well nigh impossible that these colors could
have lasted through so many centuries, and be even now
strikingly beautiful? Observe, likewise, what is sculptured
on the walls : you may not, any more than myself, be capa-
ble of reading with ﬂuency the story which the hieroglyphics
tell, and without much previous study you will not see the
reason or propriety of many things which appear very singu-
lar, not to say grotesque; but, nevertheless you can enjoy
with me such points as are open to the view of all; you can
- see what progress the ancient Egyptians had made in the
arts of sculpture, painting and architecture; you can form
something of an idea of their warlike spirit, of their wealth,
their luxury, their amusements, their occupations, and their
religious sentimentsand conduct; and you can appreciate
their greatness in some or many respects, and mourn over
their degradation and superstition in those matters which

* I measured several ofthe ﬁgures sculptured on the walls and columns, and
m illustration of the remark above, I may mention that one of the female ﬁg-
ures, ﬁve feet two inches high, had a waist of ﬁve inches, and a foot of fourteen
inches in length: and this was the usual proportion.
