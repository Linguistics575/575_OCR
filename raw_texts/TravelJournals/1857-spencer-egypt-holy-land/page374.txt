MR. BARTLETT’S erws. 34:)

the matter and the more closely I examine the subject, the
more‘thoroughly am I convinced, notwithstanding lwas in
great doubt when I went to Jerusalem, that, take the argument
as a whole,. it approaches almost to a demonstration: less
than this I should hardly dare to deem sufﬁcient; more than
this, I should be ashamed to presume to ask.

And now,'rny dear 8., I do most sincerely beg pardon for
this unconscionably long discussionz‘take it for what it -is
worth; and though that may be little, yet believe me that
truth only is my end and aim. If truth be at all promoted
by what I have said’or written, I shall esteem myself happy
and honored: pray for me and with me, that it be not sullied
or undervalued by aught which I may attempt to do to pro-
mote its spread among men.

P. S. I cannot forbear adding two or three quotations from
the Works of living writers bearing on the discussion in the
present letter: they are worth perusing, and are not wanting
in signiﬁcancy, coming, as they do, from the decided oppo-
nents of the view which I have ventured to adopt.

“We cannot doubt that the Apostles and ﬁrst Christian con-
verts at Jerusalem, must not only have known the spot, but
that this knowledge must have descended to the next genera-
tion, even though no peculiar sanctity were by them attributed
to it. Soon after the destruction of the city, it is generally
supposed that'some among them returned to re-establish them-
selves amongits ruins; and it seems almost incredible that they
should not have 'sought for the spot again, and pointed it out
to their descendants, as worthy of pious remembrance. Making
every allowance for the fact that the ﬁrst converts were
rather absorbed in the~spiritual inﬂuences of Christianity,

than careful about the different sites of its history, we think
