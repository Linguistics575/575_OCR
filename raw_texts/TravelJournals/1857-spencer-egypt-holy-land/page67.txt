40 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

ascend the Pyramids with little difﬁculty, and scarcely any
fatigue. Invalids, however, and bad climbers—ladies in par-
ticular,—-—not infrequently ﬁnd, that the pleasure of standing
on the summit, and beholding the scene there spread out to
the view, barely compensates for the toil of the ascent.
There is something rather surprising in the fact, that the
top of the Great Pyramid, which, from the bottom, appears
only partially broken off, presents, when you are really there,
a broad surface of between thirty and forty feet. In former
times, it appears that the platform was much less; and, we
are told that, in the earliest ages the Pyramid was complete
and ﬁnished up to the very apex; but, as is well known,
the vast structures here situate were used by the Saracen
conquerors as quarries, from which to obtain stone for the '
ediﬁces of Cairo, and consequently, not only the casing-stones,
which the Great Pyramid is said to have once possessed, and
which are partially remaining on the second,‘have been car-
ried off, but also many blocks have been rolled down from
the top, breaking and crushing the sides and corners of most
of the layers in their descent, as well as diminishing the ver-
tical height of the Pyramids. We spent nearly an hour in
this elevated position, and were not a little interested in the
extensive and varied prospect spread out before us in every
direction. The atmosphere was not so clear and transparent
as is usual in this ﬁne climate, and I found the thermometer
had risen to 77°; but nevertheless, Cairo, with its towering
Citadel and tapering minarets, was distinctly visible; and in
the distance, the range of the Mokattarn hills, and the
quarries of Masarah, from whence the stone used in building
the Pyramids was brought, added interest and variety to the
scene; a short way to the east, the Nile ﬂowed along in
still majesty, and the green and fertile ﬁelds, with occasional
villages here and there, contrasted most strikingly with the
barren Libyan desert, reaching away for miles and miles be-
yond the eye’s range, and presenting a most cheerless aspect.
