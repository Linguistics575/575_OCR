simple and wholesome process; and thus they go on, year
after year, sometimes fairly weathering through ﬂies, sores,
exposure, ﬁlth and everything, and blessed with the use of
one or both eyes, but very generally either losing the sight
entirely, or deprived of one eye, or becoming partially blind
for life. My pity was strongly excited for the poor children,
as I gazed upon them; but I confess a feeling of strong in-

pernicious superstition which has had so much to do with
promoting this shameful neglect of one of the greatest bless-

For miles, the suburbs are covered with the ruins of the ancient town. Heaps
