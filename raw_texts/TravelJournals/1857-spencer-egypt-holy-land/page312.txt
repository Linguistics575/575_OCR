HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. 28:)

that there is considerable wealth boarded up in Jerusalem,
and in private, and unseen by the jealous Turks, some fami-
lies live in the enjoyment of luxuries and comforts far beyond
what might be supposed to belong to them, judging from their
personal appearance or the exterior of their habitations.

Here it may be well to pause awhile before turning our
attention to other matters : let us pray for the peace of Jeru-
salem; as she now is, torn by dissension and trodden down
by the scorner, her case is pitiable indeed; but letfrus hope
that God may soon arise and have mercy upon her, for His
compassions fail not, and in the midst of wrath He remem-
bers mercy. I know that you will join me, more fervently,
if possible, than ever, in the petition taught us by our Divine
Lord Himself :—“ Thy kingdom come ; Thy will be done on
earth as it is in Heaven.”
