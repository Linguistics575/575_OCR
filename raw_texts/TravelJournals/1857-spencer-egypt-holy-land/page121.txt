94 EGYPT AND THE HoLY LAND.

twenty-ﬁve or thirty feet upon the Nile, which ﬂows rapidly
by on either side, till it meets again below, to rush impetuously,
down the rapids: at this point, too, I gained another ﬁne w'ew
of the country above ancient Syene, and occasionally had an
opportunity to notice the difference between the Nubianrace
and the Arab population of the Lower Nile. The former
are, as you may know, more brave and warlike, and conse-
quently possessed of greater liberty than the people of the
North: the fellahin of the villages are usually quiet and
peaceable, and, having suffered from the hand of despotism
being laid heavily upon them, are more degraded and less
spirited than the dark-skinned inhabitants of the South. I
regret that I cannot give you exactly the entire length of
these ruins, and some other measurements which would en-
able you to gain a better idea of their great extent and im-
posing appearance: I can only say, that the island appeared
to me to be about two thousand feet in length, by perhaps
three hundred feet in breadth in its widest portion. Nearly
the whole is occupied by the temples, and buildings of that
sort, a fact which may aid you, in part, at least, in under-

I shall not pretend to enter into a detailed account of all
that Philae offers to the lover of ancient things; it would not
interest you to an extent sufﬁcient to warrant me in under-
taking so laborious a task, and besides I feel my own incom-
petency too sensibly to venture upon a matter of this impor-

* “At three we arrived at Philae, called by Hamilton and Burckhutdt, Gie-
siret e1 Berbe el Ghassir, or Giesiret Anas el Wodjoud. The ﬁrstof these names
means the Island ofruined Temples—not an inapt denomination. Philae is the
easternmost of a group of islands and rocks which compose the ﬁrst cataracts It
is about halfa mile long, rather high, and being entirely covered with magniﬁ-
cent ruins, has a grand and imposing appearance: the lofty pylons are seen at
a great distance, and produce a ﬁne eﬂ‘eet. The island divides the'Nile into two
streams, and the water, ﬁnding so great an impediment in its course, rushes by
with considerable velocity."—Irby and Mangles’ “Travels in Egypt, Nubia,”
