Tue Holy City is, in many respects, unlike every other
city in the world: there is no period in its history which is not
full of interest; there is not a locality in or aboutit, which
has not some connection with events of moment, or with the
sad story of its degradation and ruin, or with its renown and
glory in other days. I ﬁnd it very difﬁcult, in consequence,
to make choice of the few points on which my limits will
allow me to dwell : to speak of all, would require volumes ;*
for it would embrace nearly the whole history of the chosen
people, and would need that every stone, every spot of ground,
every tower and building, every single one of the thousand
places which are enshrined in the memory of Christians, be
spoken of with fulness and carefulness of detail. I should
hardly dare, under any circumstances, to undertake a task
