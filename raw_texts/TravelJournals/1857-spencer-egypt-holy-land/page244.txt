MOHAMMED ALI AND ms FAMILY. 217

ral, and is as capricious as a spoiled child: his attendants and
suite go with him wherever his fancy may suggest, and hardly
a day passes without their being on the move to and fro, be-

and though treated with agreat deal of outward attention, he
was in reality shabbily used, and obliged to put up with things
that would have roused all the ire of his grandfather. His
character may be summed up in few words; he is a mix-
