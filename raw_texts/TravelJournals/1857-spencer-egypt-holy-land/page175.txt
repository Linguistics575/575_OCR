148 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

Here you will observe the ﬁgure of a captive, bound and at-
tached to a large number of others (on the same wall, but not
appearing in the picture above). The king, whose proportions
are colossal, is represented as standing erect and threatening,
with his arms stretched out, the group of prisoners and foreign-
ers, Whom he is holding by the hair with one of his hands. He
conducts before the Theban triad, (i. e. Amn, Neith, Khunsu,)
the chiefs of more than thirty nations, whom he has subdued:
they are bound by the neck, and each of them has near him
an embattled shield or buckler, in which is inscribed the
name of the conquered country or city. The prince whose
ﬁgure you see above, is one of these: he has a pointed beard,
and the physiognomy of an Asiatic, and the name of his
kingdom is written in the shield. The king, whose arms
effected all this, bears the name of Sheshonk, the Sesonchis
of Manetho’s lists, and evidently the same as Shishak of the
Scriptures.* In order that you may see how the hieroglyphics
are interpreted, I subjoin those contained in the cartouche
above, with the names of the phonetic signs and their equiv-
alent letters:

‘ ﬂ = two reeds: sound I, originally, AA.
