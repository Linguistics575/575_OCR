272 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

no words can adequately set forth ; and its various quarters,
and its many traditionary sacred spots, excite in him the most
lively emotions, even though he feel convinced, that most of
these traditions have no foundation in fact, and are only the
result of that unwise effort to give local habitation to every
event and circumstance of the Gospel history. Hence, if I

away with him, is one of pleasure rather than of pain; and
whenever his thoughts recur to Jerusalem, in after days, he

fully closed; in Jerusalem, I think every door which I saw
had an iron ring on it, which served the purposes of a
knocker. One peculiarity in the rooms is well worth record-

learn or could observe, but What has several of its upper
