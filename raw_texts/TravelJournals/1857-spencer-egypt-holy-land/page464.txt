ASCENT 0F MOUNT TABOR. 435

Where He, our Lord, restored the dead to life, and left the
impress of peace and good-will upon the hearts of men.
Continuing our course over the plain, we skirted the
western base of Jebel ed-Duhy, or the Little Hermon, and
bending towards the east, had in full view Jebel et-Tor, or

a road, sometimes paved and constructed with care, on the
slope of the mountains. but more generally very uneven,
rocky, and not devoid of danger to the unwary traveller: we
did not see any of the wild boars or leopards which are said
by some writers to be occasionally found here; all was still
