MUSINGS overt THE SEPULCHRE. 323

Game ere the stars of Syria’s cloudless skies
Grew pale before their morning burst of ﬂame.

Oh! if the lichen now were free to twine

O’er the dark entrance ofthat rock-hewn cell,

Say, should we miss the gold-encrusted shrine

0r incense fumes’ intoxicating spell?

Would not the whispering breeze, as evening fcll,

Make deeper music in the palm-trees’ shade

Than choral prayer or chanted ritual’s swell?

Can the proud shafts of Helena’s Colonnade

Match thy time-hallowed stems, Gethsemane’s holy glade 2”"

How easy is it here, too, to object and disbelieve, when the
architects of Constantine, and later nursing fathers of the
Church, saw ﬁt to level down the rock in which the tomb
was, and thus to make it as unlike the original as was in
their power! What wonder is it that the mind of man, re-
volting at imposture and deception in so many instances un.
der. the roof of this very ediﬁce, termed the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre, should indignantly cast away everything
relating to it as unworthy his attention, and ﬁt only for the
ignorant and credulous pilgrim!

‘ In deep and solemn silence let us muse awhile in this holy
place; and with hearts full of faith in that gracious Lord
who triumphed over death, and by his glorious resurrection
opened unto us the gates of everlasting life, let us pour out
our devout prayers and supplications for the enlightening,
strengthening, and purifying graces of the Holy Ghost, the
Comforter. Lord, I believe; help Thou mine unbelief. God
be merciful to me a sinner. Thou art our Redeemer ; Thou
art our all: make no long tarrying, O my God! 0 death,
Where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? Thanks
be to God, who giveth us the victory, through our LORD
Jesus CHRIST. Shall our hearts be untouched, and cold, and
hard, in such a place as this? Shall we not hope and believe

ii. p. '75.
