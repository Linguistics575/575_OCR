156 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

Before leaving Dendera, I must tell you of one sculpture
in particular, which interested me equally with every person
who has heard the name of Egypt’s beautiful but licentious
queen. It is rather curious, and well worth a few moments’
examination, which was all that we had time to devote to it.
On the baok'wall of the exterior, we found several colossal
ﬁgures, two of which represented the far-famed Cleopatra and
her son Caesarion, so named from his father, Julius Caesar.
I can hardly express my surprise that this singularly un-
handsome ﬁgure should be meant for one whose charms of
person were no less renowned than her seductive graces and
brilliancy of mind. The features are heavy, and the whole
face wears a dull and inexpressive look: if it be a portrait in
any sense, Cleopatra could have possessed none of that striking
beauty which all story attributes to her; and we must sup-
pose both that the artist never saw the queen, and that he
possessed but little skill in representing the face and person
of his far-famed mistress. The accompanying hastily-made
sketch, will, I hope, enable you to form an idea of what the
artist has done in this matter, and may also serve as a speci-
men of the usual mode of seulpturing the human ﬁgure on
the walls and columns of ancient Egyptian temples: my
only objection to it is, that it is too favorable, rather than the
reverse, and you do not in the picture feel the singular ill
proportion to exist, to the, same extent as in the colossal
ﬁgure on the wall of the temple itself. To show you what I
mean, let me give you the measurements which I made on
the occasion: the feet are very ﬂat or thin, and two feet in
‘length; the height of the ﬁgure to the top of the head is
fourteen feet, the crown being four feet nine inches high,
making in all eighteen feet nine inches; and yet, notwith-
standing this, the waist is only ﬁfteen inches; and the legs,
and body, as a whole, are equally thin and pinched, as it
were, out of all fair proportion.
