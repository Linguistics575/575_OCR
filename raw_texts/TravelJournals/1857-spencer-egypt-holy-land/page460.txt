ANTONIO AND THE JENIN PEOPLE. 431

aged to steal—not of his master—but of Antonio himself, to
the amount of about a hundred dollars: the next day, on
complaint being made, the governor had the thieves arrested,
promised redress, talked round and round, and ended by doing
nothing; and so Antonio was compelled to leave Jenin, be-

the fact, that from its elevated site, you can look abroad over
that noble and farrfamed plain of Esdraelon, stretching away
to a very great distance, and lying spread out, in all its ver-

gaze of the traveller. I can but feebly express to you my
