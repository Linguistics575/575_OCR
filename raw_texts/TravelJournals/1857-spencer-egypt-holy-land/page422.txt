PLAIN NEAR JERICHO. 393

water, and remounting our horses, We bade adieu to this
deeply interesting place. Our faces were turned towards J eri-
cho, a city belonging to that broad plain, or

“ neighboring land, whose palmy shore
The silver Jordan Iaves ;”

and as, late in the afternoon, we spurred our horses onward
to reach the place of encampment, we were fully alive to the
beauty of this region as it once was in the days of its glory.
Even now, desolate and degraded, it wears some marks of
its former excellence, but they are few indeed, and only serve
to remind one very painfully of what it was and what it
might be again. May that day soon come when it will
please God to have mercy upon the chosen land, and the
people to whom He promised it as a perpetual possession!
While we were riding onward, we saw only a little way off,
several of that beautiful animal, the gazelle, and for a few
minutes we gave chase, hoping to get a shot at one; but
they were too ﬂeet for us and were ere long out of sight;
we saw, too, numbers of quails and some other birds, but
did not shoot at any of them. As we approached Jericho,
we saw a large old castle near by, at present in ruins, but
evidently at one time of great strength and importance. I
could get no information worth having as to what it was or
when it was built; for the Arabs are very stupid and care-
less in respect to all the questions which interest strangers
so much ;* and in general their stories are very little worth.
If they hear any one guess or imagine that an old ruin be-
longs to a particular town, or some old tower might bear
such and such a name, their usual plan is to repeat all this
for fact to the next party they meet, and by repeating it a
number of times they get to believe it themselves and

* Dr. Robinson (vol. ii. p. 295) attributes the castle to the Saracenie times,
about the twelfth century, when all this region was renowned for its high state
of cultivation and its ﬁelds, gardens, fruits, ﬁve.
