50 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

rivals in interest the vast structures near which it stands.
Perhaps no collection of monuments in the wide world has
so many claims upon the traveller as this, for none can equal
it in antiquity, in impressiveness, in gloomy grandeur. If,
as I stood upon the summit of the Great Pyramid, I was
struck with feelings such as I have alluded to, how much
more forcibly were my thoughts now directed in the same
channel; for here, under our feet, all is ruin and decay, all
manifest the triumph of death and the mutability of human
affairs. The whole plain is ﬁlled with the marks and proofs
of death; the Pyramids, as is thought, and with great proba-
bility, were mausoleums; the rocky sides of the elevation on
which they stand abound in excavations for tombs, and hun—
dreds of pits or burial-places have been dug in the vicinity
of the Pyramids ; and beside all these, the sands of the great
desert have swept over everything, covering many objects
entirely from sight, and lying in heaps and great masses in
every direction as far as the eye can reach. Truly, this were
a ﬁt place to muse over the past, and musing, to lay up in
store lessons of sound wisdom and instruction; truly, this were
the place to burst forth in the words of the accomplished and
ill-fated Raleigh,—“ O eloquent, just and mighty Death!
whom none could advise, thou hast persuaded; what none
have dared, thou hast done; and whom all the world have
ﬂattered, thou only hast cast out and despised: thou hast
drawn together all the far-stretched greatness, all the pride,
cruelty and ambition of man, and covered it all over with
these two narrow words, ,mc JACET.”

The great length to which my rather discursive remarks
have extended, warns me of the necessity of drawing to a close ;
but as I have alluded to some questions of great interest in
connection with the Pyramids in general, and have as yet had
neither time nor space to say aught about the Great Sphinx,
and the Second and Third Pyramids, I will, with your permis-
sion, stop here, and resume the subject in another Letter.
