dearer to him than all else in the wide world, and had most of all in
view, her interest and pleasure; and if there be aught of life or value
in them to readers in general, it may not improperly be attributed to
the fact of the Author’s writing on the spot, while the subjects were
fresh in his mind and ﬁlling all his thoughts.

It has been a pleasing thing to him, to hope, that many a reader will
love to hear of those sacred regions, where our Lord walked in the days
of His ﬂesh, and will love to know how full of Holy Scripture is the
Holy Land; and hence, though originally he wrote for one out of the

would fain hope that, though the following Letters do not pretend to
any original research in the great ﬁeld of geography, history, and an~
tiquities, the reader may, notwithstanding, obtain a tolerable idea from
them, of the most impeltarrt points of interest to the Christian student.

In justice to himself, the Author deems it but right to speak of a mat-

1848, he had no expectation whatever of proceeding beyond England
