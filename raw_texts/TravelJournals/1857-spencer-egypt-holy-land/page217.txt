I DO not know that there is anything in any country,
which, to a thoughtful mind, is more full of interest, and
more strikingly illustrative of the character and condition of
the people, than their religious ediﬁces. Go where we will,
we are sure to ﬁnd evidences of some sort of belief in superior
power and agency, whether it be the wretched idolatry of the
Hindoos, the false creed of the Arabian impostor, or the pure
and true faith of the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; and
we are equally sure to meet with houses of worship, and edi-
ﬁces devoted to religion, which afford us an insight into the
nature of their belief, and tend to show the near approach of
nations and people to the truth, as it is in Jesus, or their vast
remove from that which constitutes the glory of Christian
lands. It was, therefore, with feelings of no ordinary char-
