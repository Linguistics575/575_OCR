IMMENSE EXTENT OF THE RUINS. 139

to the skies—'“ in its meek beauty, the record of a daughter’s
love, love strong as death, stronger, for it has triumphed :”
lookat the sad ruins allaround, and reﬂect for a moment
upon the powerful'means which must have been used, to de-
stroy, as well as to erect such works as these: walk still
further on, and gaze at other portions of this grand temple,
without pretending for a moment to examine aught in detail;
and whenn'you have done this much, take note of the time
which even so cursory a look at Karnak has consumed, and
you will be surprised to ﬁnd that the hours have slipped away,
you know not how, and that you have not yet begun to take
in the grandeur of the scene, or to comprehend the greatness
of those, who, ages’ago, ruled in power and glory in hundred-
gated Thebes.

If, on former occasions, I have not ventured to go into de-
tails, much less dare I venture here to pretend to describe
.with any fuhiess and precision, the varied objects which meet
the eye of the beholder, and ﬁll him with inexpressible aston-

of them deeply important in a historical point of view; the
unrivalled Columns; or of the sculptures, which are found on
every wall, and illustrative of so many and so various sub-
jects.* With your permission, therefore, I shall pass over in

‘ “ Never were pages more graphic. The gathering, the march, the melee—
the Pharaoh’s-prowess, standing erect, as he always does, in his car—no charé
ioteer—the reins attached to his waist—the arrow drawn to his ear—his horses,
all ﬁre,‘springing into the air like Pegasuses,—and then, the agony ofthe dying,
transﬁxed by his darts, the relaxed limbs of the'slain—Homer’s truth itself; and
lastly, the triumphant return, the welcome home, and the olfering of thanksgiv-
ing to Amunre—the ﬁre, the discrimination with which these ideas are bodied
forth, they must be seen to judge of it."—Lord Lindsay’s “ Letters on Egypt,”
&c., p. 85. ~
