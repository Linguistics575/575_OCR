76 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

with his prayers, on any occasion since we have been on
board. Honest we have thus far found them, but not always
truth-telling, and not always to be relied on, Where their fears
of punishment or their desires of gain interpose. With
care and decision there is no difﬁculty in managing them,
especially if the custom of giving bakhshz‘s/L be judiciously

with his department. Our Arab boy is an idle, good-natured,
good-for-nothing young fellow, who does odds and ends about
the boat, helps the cook, &c., and like the natives of Egypt
