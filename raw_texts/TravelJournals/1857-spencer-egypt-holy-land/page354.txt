MOUNT CALVARY. 395

below, as you may see in another chapel contiguous to the
side of Calvary, and runs down to an unknown depth in the
earth. That this rent was made by the earthquake that hap-
pened at our Lord’s passion, there is only tradition to prove;
but that it is a natural and genuine breach, and not counter-
feited by any art, the sense and reason of every one that sees
it may convince him: for the sides of it ﬁt like two tallies to
each other, and yet it runs in such intricate windings as could
not well.be counterfeited by art, nor arrived at by any in-
struments.”* '

As we gaze upon these mementoes of the past, and feeling
how little, after all, we realize the momentous importance of
the awful events and circumstances connected with our Lord’s
cross and passion, may we not take upon our lips the self-ac-
cusing Words which the poet puts into the mouth of the Cru-
saders when they beheld Jerusalem?

“ Here, Lord, where currents from thy wounded side
Stain’d the besprinkled ground with sanguine red,
Should not these two quick springs at least, their tide
In bitter memory of Thy passion shed !
And melt’st thou not, my icy heart, where bled
Thy dear Redeemer '1 still must pity sleep?
My ﬂinty bosom, why so cold and dead?
Break, and with tears the hallow’d region steep!
If that thou weep’st not now, forcvcr shouldst thou weep l”1'

Descending again into the church, We enter a chapel un-
derneath the hill of Calvary: here are pointed out to us the
tombs of the noble Godfrey de Bouillon and his brother Bald-
win; the inscriptions on their tombs are not very legible, but.
you may think them worth copying.
