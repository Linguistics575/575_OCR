EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

“ Thy holy cities are a wilderness,
Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
Our holy and our beautiful house,
there our fathers praised thee,
Is burned up with ﬁre ;
And all our pleasant things are laid waste.”

“ Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen.”

“Egypt shall be a desolation,
And Edom shall be a desolate wilderness,
For the violence against the children of Judah,
Because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
But Judah shall dwell forever,
And Jerusalem from generation to generation.”

“They shall call thee, The City of the LORD,
The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated,
So that no man went through thee,
I will make thee an eternal exeellency,
A joy of many generations.”

“ The Loan shall inherit Judah his portion in the Holy Land,
And shall choose Jerusalem again.”
Isaiah lxiv. 10; iii. 8; Joel iii. 19, 20; Is. Ix. 15; Zeeh. ii. 12.
