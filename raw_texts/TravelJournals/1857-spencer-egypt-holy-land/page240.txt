COPTIC MODE 0F \VORSHIP. 213

observe all that was going'on. Every person, when he came
into the church, went ﬁrst to the chancel door, prostrated
himself there towards the altar, and touching his lips to one
side of the entrance, bowed, crossed himself, and kissed the
hand of one or more of the priests stationed in this compart-

the same ceremonies were performed' towards him,—a fact
which I was pained to learn, since, however the former might

major part of the service is performed in it, particularly the
Communion service; as respects the Gospels and Homilies”
which are read in the church, after the reader has gone over
them in Coptic, another person, standing in the doorway of
the compartment before the chancel, reads or chants the les-
sons or explanations in Arabic, the vernacular tongue of the
people at the present day. There is a good deal of this mo.
notorious chanting, and some loud singing and beating of
