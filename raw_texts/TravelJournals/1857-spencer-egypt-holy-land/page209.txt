182 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

blank walls and an earthen ﬂoor, which do not seem to pro-
mise much. We follow the sober Arab, who moves at just
such a pace, and rejoices in the name of Mﬁsa, and he leads
us up a staircase of stone steps, which 'wind at every third or
fourth step during the whole ascent: it is lighted from above,
being open to the sky. By and by, we get to the third story,
as we should call it, and leaving the stairs enter a broad
space paved with stone, and having doors leading to rooms on

season, accustom one soOn to these changes. You will no-
tice, too, in the house where we are, that there is no harim,
and of course no portion of it set aside as forbidden to any
but the husband and female visitors; in others, where Euro-
peans choose to adopt this custom likewise, the apartments
of the women form an important portion of the house—a por-
