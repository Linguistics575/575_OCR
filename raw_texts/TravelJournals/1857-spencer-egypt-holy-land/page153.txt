126 EGYPT AND THE HOLY‘ LAND.

despite all the defects of perspective drawing, and the want
of proportion in many ways and in many portions of the
ﬁgures, even the most casual observer must render the
tribute of praise to the general effectiveness of the whole,
and the singular accuracy and minuteness of most of the
details. He cannot well fail, also, being impressed with
the temple, as a whole, and as illustrating the main fea-

It may appear somewhat fanciful, but under the inﬂuence
of our present circumstances, and the romance connected
with the thing, we could not‘ resist the inclination to visit the
Vocal Memnon at the hour when so many pilgrims, both
Greek and Roman, came to hear its heavenly voice, as they
