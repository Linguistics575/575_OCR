436 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

rdunding the Whole mount, it would have been a gloomy and
a dreary ride indeed. As we came near the top, we looked
with much interest upon the numerous remains of fortiﬁca- '
tions which formerly existed here, and our thoughts were
Carried back to the period when Mount Tabor was one of
the very strongest fortresses in all Palestine. Unscienti-ﬁc
as I am in everything relative to military matters. I could
not but perceive that naturally Tabor possessed all the ele-
ments of strength, and I could well understand how the
hand of art was enabled to render it impregnable: in such
point of view it was, no doubt, regarded in early times; for
.here we now see the strong foundation walls of a fortress,
and the remains of towers, trenches, vaults, cisterns, gate-

when we had actually gained the summit and had gone over
it slowly and carefully; for, somewhat to our surprise, we

with its'green mantle, has almost obliterated the evidences
of human skill and human ingenuity; and now no more is
heard, the shrill trump of war, the martial tread of thou-

greet the traveller on Tabor’s summit. '

V And yet we enjoyed our visit more than I can adequately
express; for notwithstanding the desolation of Tabor, com-
pared with its glory once, in other days, we beheld there
What man has neither given nor can take away—the glorious
view of the surrounding country, which is unsurpassed in all
