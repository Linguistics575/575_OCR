OUR LoRD’s GRACIOUS WORDS. 4,13

The Woman, in her astonishment at the request, asks Him the
question, how it was that He would do thus, and demand
drink of a woman of Samaria. The blessed Saviour conde-
scends to continue the conversation thus begun, and by His
heavenly discourse both manifests His compassion to her igno-
rance, reveals His heavenly doctrine, and proclaims to her His
true character as the Messiah of God. When she, with all
the zeal of one who had taken part in the bitter controversy
which raged between Samaritan and Jew ever since Sanbal-
lat, by permission of Alexander the Great, had built on Mount
Gerizim a temple for his son-in-law, Manasseh, in opposition
to the temple of Jehovah at Jerusalem, was eager to know
from one who was possessed of prophetic and Divine knowl-
edge, the truth on the question at issue; Jesus replied,
“Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither
in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.
Ye worship ye know not what ; we know what we worship;
for salvation is of the Jews; but the hour cometh, and now
is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in
spirit and in truth; for the Father seeketh such to worship
Him. God is a Spirit, and they that worship Him must wor-
ship Him in spirit and in truth.” It may be that neither the
woman nor yet His disciples, who enjoyed His daily teaching,
understood the full import of these momentous Words; but to
us, who live in these days of Christian light and blessing,
they are clear, most impressive, and full of comfort; for God
our Saviour, in His love and compassion, requires of us now
the service and obedience of faithful hearts and lives, and not
that we should three times a year, as of old, go up to His
temple at Jerusalem. Let us bless and praise His holy name
that His Church is no longer conﬁned to one people, one
country, one language, but is now catholic, for all ages, all
climes, all people of the earth l

We did not venture to linger here very long, for the after-
noon’s sun warned us to ﬁx upon our place of encampment
