' NABLUS, April 19th, 1849.
MY DEAR 8.,

ON Tuesday afternoon last, We made our ﬁnal arrange-
ments for leaving the Holy City. After seeing our mules
well packed and sent on ahead to meet us at a certain point,
and after paying our respects to the few friends and brethren
whom we were leaving behind, we mounted our horses, and
rode out of the J aﬁ'a Gate, with feelings which you can imag-

heart, and to stir up the deepest sympathies of the soul, that
every pilgrim who has been privileged to sojourn a few weeks
Within its hallowed precincts, is ﬁlled with regret and sorrow
when the hour arrives at which he must bid it adieu forever.
We passed out of the gate slowly and sadly; cast one linger-
ing look down the narrow ravine, with the heights of Zion
on the one hand, and a part of the vale of Hinnom beyond;
