AMERICAN MISSIONS IN SYRIA. 483

desirable, or whether the inﬂuence of the mission can in this
way best be exerted.

For my own part, I frankly avow my opinion that missions
from the various religious bodies who contribute to the sup-
port of the gentlemen laboring in Syria can never be produc-
tive of permanent results. I was astonished to learn how

doubt not the Oriental Churches are open to labors for this end,
as much so as could he wished or expected. Yet, if there be
not an agreement with them as to the foundation on which
the Church rests, and as to what it is, immense will be the
