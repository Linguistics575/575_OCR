EGYPrIAN ARCHITECTURE. 95

tance. You will pardon me, however, I trust, if I speak of
one or two particulars, in connection with this lovely island,
of more than ordinary interest. Without dwelling upon the
hieroglyphics or sculptures Which abound on the walls and
columns of the temples at Philae, I cannot but call your at-
tention to the character of the architecture, so diﬂ'erent from
that of every other land, and the singular brilliancy and clear-
ness of the colors which have lasted so many centuries, and
appear almost as if the work of the past year. In general,
there is, if I may venture to say it, a heaviness about Egyp-

form the walls; the want of relief to a broad and high wall,
such as is found in our western style of architecture; and the
singularly grotesque objects by which the artist sought to di-

as a whole, appear to me as serious defects. My experience
is, of course, slight, and therefore my opinion is of small
value; but I cannot yet say that I have felt any of that ex-

of ancient Egyptian temples; nor have I been able to look
upon any one scene which conveyed a tithe of the delight
which I found in various old castles and churches in England
and on the continent. Apart from the great antiquity of
Egypt and its temples, and the charm which its historic
recollections and associations must ever throw around it, I
do not suppose that the world would be especially struck with
the heavy masses of stone, the enormous pillars, the excess
of ornament, the vast expanse of side-wall, and such like fea-
tures of the architecture of this wonderful land; and certainly
I do not conceive that it would for a moment be compared
.With the chaste elegance of the Grecian, or the imposing
grandeur of the Gothic style. Even Sir G. Wilkinson con-
fesses that the architecture of the Ptolemaic period (during
which Philae was devoted to the purposes of religious wor-
ship) has little to satisfy the mind or gratify the taste, and
