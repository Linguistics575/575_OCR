LEGENDS AND TRADITIONS. 36.5

mercy in all that 'He did ; there was dignity and propriety in
every word and act of, His : but if you can see any reason,
or anything proﬁtable to soul or body in such a childish thing
as making the mark of His foot on the rock, I cannot; and I
shOuld be sorry to believe that any sensible man, any one
who loves and adores his Saviour, can really credit a story

We may not now stopto examine those monuments of other
days, not far to our left, said to be the tomb of Absalom, the
tomb of Jehoshaphat, the cave of St. James, &e.; neither
can we linger here in the valley of J ehoshaphat, beautiful as
