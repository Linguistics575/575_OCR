316 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

Christian writers. I am very well aware that this frank
avowal may lay me open to suspicion in certain quarters;
and it may be surmised, if not said, that because of such in-
clinations on my part, I am not altogether a trustworthy
witness ; that my vision has been warped; and that my
wishes have biassed me in a particular direction or perverted
the evidence on disputed points,—all the time forgetting that
remarks of this kind are as applicable in one direction as

be sacred, it has, to some extent at least, become the fashion
not merely to examine the evidence and to decide solely in
accordance with it, but rather to inquire into the theological
opinions of the witness, and according as they may be, either
to throw doubt upon, or add force to, the value of his testi— ’
mcny. If a man have a love and reverence for the ancients,
as notwithstanding all their faults and failings, his fathers in
the Church, is he therefore to be held accountable for aid that
