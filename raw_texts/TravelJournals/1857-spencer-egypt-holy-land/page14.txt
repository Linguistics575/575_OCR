PREFACE.

 

THE Author of the following Letters is anxious to say a word or two
to his readers, before they do him the honor of venturing upon the
perusal of what he has written. It is to forewarn them that they are
not to expect erudite disquisitions on antiquity, history, chronolog , and
such like matters; neither must they look here for critical dissertations
on science in its various relations to Egyptian or Hebraistic lore. Though
the Author has transgressed on one or two occasions, being led away
by the deep interest of the subject, he, nevertheless, makes no preten-
sions to more than ordinary ﬁtness for dealing with the vexatee quies-
tiones of scholars; and were he able to add any of his own learned
dulness, to the mass already reposing on the shelves of royal and na-
tional libraries, he would, under the circumstances under which he
wrote, most carefully have eschewed everything of the sort. He begs
to assure his readers, that the Letters now made public, were actually
written—except in a few instances—as they profess to be, and at the
time when they are dated:* they were addressed to one at home,

* It is but proper, however, to state, that on revising the Letters since his return,
the Author has added notes here and there from works published since the date
of the Letters in the present volume. He has also in his quotations from Mn
Williams’s “Holy City,” made them contbrmable to the second and enlarged
edition of that valuable work: while the Author was in the East the ﬁrst and
less complete edition was all that was accessible to him. He has preferred this
course, wherever it seemed desirable, even at the risk of being charged with
anachronisms.
