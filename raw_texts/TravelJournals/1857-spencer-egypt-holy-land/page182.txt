INTERIOR on THE TEMPLE. 155

bish and dirt which had almost filled up the interior of the
portico and rooms behind, it is not so easy as one could de-
sire, to examine the zodiac on the ceiling of the portico. I
shall not trouble you with the learned controversy in regard to
this, as well as the only two other known in Egypt (at
Esneh and the neighboring Ed-Deir); it is sufﬁcient to be
assured that. the fears of some who apprehended danger to the
authority of the Scriptures, and the exultation of others who
imagined that here was a monument reaching back into
almost indeﬁnite antiquity, are equally groundless; and so
far from this zodiac “being of early Pharaonic time, or of an
antediluvian age, it is (in fact) conﬁned to the more modest
and more probable antiquity of eighteen hundred years :” the
same, too, is true of the other zodiacs, which are of Ptolemaic
or Roman date. It was difficult, as I have said, to get much
satisfaction in looking at the zodiac so far above our heads;
so after examining a few points with care, we searched out
the chamber on the ceiling of which was the small plani-
sphere, which I well recollect poring over many a time last
summer in Paris: it has been placed in one of the lower
rooms in the “Bibliothéque Royale ;” but its value, as is evi-
dent from its probable date, is not very great or important.
I do not pretend to say that it is not right to carry off objects
of science and art from the temples and ruins of Egypt; you
will pardon me, however, I trust, for expressing a feeling of
regret, which I am sure comes over almost all travellers who
visit Egypt, that it is not possible to see everything which
belongs to a particular ediﬁce or locality in the place which it
once occupied, and where its interest is a hundred-fold greater
than when severed from its legitimate connection. How
much to. be deplored is it, that the ruler of this land has not
the spirit and the knowledge which would prompt him to pre-
serve the many remains of art in Egypt, and to form a grand
museum of antiquities, unrivalled by aught which the world
contains!
