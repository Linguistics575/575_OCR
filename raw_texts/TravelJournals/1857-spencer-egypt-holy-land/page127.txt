100 EGYPT AND THE HOLY LAND.

statues, and sarcophagi to their} destination, often hundreds
of miles distant! I can hardly believe what is generally
stated by writers on antiquities, that this wonderful people
had-no tools of iron, but that all their work was done with so
inferior a metal as copper or brass: if the fact be really so, it
heightens the idea of their skill and capacity, and almost puts
to shame the greatest efforts of art in modern times. It was
a curious thing to see an obelisk nearly completed and wrought
with care, lying as it were just ready to be removed; and it
did not require much stretch of imagination to suppose that
the workmen had only recently left it, and that instead of
thousands of years which have passed away never to return,
only a few days had elapsed since the skilful artisans of some
old Pharaoh were singing merrily over their work. Leaving
this singular remnant of antiquity, my guide next carried
me up a steep ascent to another very remarkable locality,
where I had an opportunity to observe the manner in which
the ancient Egyptians used to cut off the blocks of stone.
several incisions about six inches deep and wide were made
in the rock, at intervals of about ten inches; into these they
appear to have driven wooden wedges, which being saturated
with water by means of a small trench cut to contain it,
ekpanded, of course, and broke off the block by their equal
pressure. In some cases, probably, a violent blow or concus-
sion was employed for the same purpose. I cannot better
conclude this brief notice of these interesting and extensifre
quarries, which contain many other very curious remains,
than by quoting the language of Wilkinson, in respect to the
component parts of syenite granite: “The nature of the
rocks about Syene,” he says, “is not, as might be expected,
exclusively syenite, but on the contrary, consists mostly of
granite, with some syenite and a little porphyry. The differ-
ence between the two former is this—that syenite is com-
posed of felspar, quartz, and hornblende, instead of mica, or
solely of felspar and quartz; and granite of felspar, quartz
