Occasionally we passed a village or two, but they were
small and of no account, so that I did not note their names;
and every little while we would mount some low hills and
come to some lovely spot, where almost involuntarily we
would pause a few moments and gaze in silence at what was
spread out before us. By and by, we reached a portion of
that long plain which stretches away far to the north, and

has never recovered from the shock, notwithstanding the
