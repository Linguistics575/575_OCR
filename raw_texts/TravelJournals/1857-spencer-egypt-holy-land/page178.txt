Gnor'roes or BENI-HASSAN, Feb. 16th, 1849.

MY DEAR. S.,

TnoooirrI date my present letter from this deeply inter-
esting point, in our journey down the Nile, I ﬁnd that there
are several rather important things, which it will hardly be
proper to omit altogether, and which, therefore, I must beg
your indulgence to permit me to speak of, before describing
the grottoes of Beni-Hassan. I refer-to our visits to Dendera
and Es-Siout: the former of these was attended with pleasure
of no ordinary kind, in the opportunity thus afforded of seeing
a temple in a state of comparative perfection and complete-
ness; and the latter was hardly less interesting and agreeable
to me, from the fact, that I was privileged in this way to
gain some insight into the condition of the Coptic church and
its bishops and clergy. Bear with me awhile, should I seem
to enlarge too much upon these matters, or lose sight of the
fact, that, perhaps no locality in Egypt has greater claims
upon the traveller, than the one whence/I am now writing.

The ruins at Dendera, or Tentyra, are situate on the west
