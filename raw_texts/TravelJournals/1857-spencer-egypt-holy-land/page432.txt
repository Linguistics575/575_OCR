DEPARTURE FROM JERUSALEM. 403

when God’s people were mourning over the desolation and
captivity of Jerusalem. I lifted my hat from my head, and
with a devout gesture, becoming the sacredness of the time,
and the words of Holy Writ, I exclaimed, from the very
depth of my heart,

“ III, forget thee, 0 Jerusalem,
Let my right hand forget her cunning.
I” do not remember thee,

pomegranates; a land of oil'olive', and honey ;” a land where
there was bread without scarceness; whose stones were iron,
and out of whose hills one might dig brass. 1 But the wicked-
nesses of the people have br‘Ought upon it the curses de-
nounced against the rebellions of Israel, and the Lord has
“rooted them out of their land, in anger and in wrath, and in
great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is
