202 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

seven, touching at but two new points —
Abydos and Tell el-Amarna.

Soon after three o’clock we arrived at the
foot of the First Cataract and tied up at As-
suan, the Syene of the Greeks, the southern
boundary of ancient Egypt and the begin-
ning of Nubia. Here we remain the next two
days.

Assuan is a town of hotels, all built on the
one main street fronting the water, with the
Cataract House at the extreme southern end
around a bend in the river on the very edge
of the desert. Its verandah faces the setting
sun and overlooks the Nile, which at this
point is broken into many channels by huge
boulders rising from the river-bed. Although
but a few years old Cataract House has been
enlarged twice. Its interior has the horse-
shoe arches and ﬁne lattice screens of Moor-
ish architecture.

of Egypt on the South.” This southern key
to the country, the Romans always kept care-
fully guarded, their two other garrisons being
stationed respectively at Cairo and Alexandria,
to fend off attacks from the east and the sea.
