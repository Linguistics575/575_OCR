110 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

These statues were probably erected by
Ramses II after his long victorious war
against the Hittites in the east. This Ram-
ses, the Osymandyas or Sesostris of Greek
story, was the greatest of all Egyptian mon-
archs. During his long reign of sixty-seven
years he got possession of Palestine, defeated
the Hittites, and erected innumerable temples
and statues of himself all over his realm.

At Abu Simbel are colossal seated ﬁgures,
at Kamak is a gigantic standing statue
nearly seventy feet high, — everywhere we
ﬁnd the name of Ramses writ large; one
tablet even crediting him with seventeen
sons. For the express pleasure of one of the
“ little sons ” of this Ramses was written that
inimitable fairy tale, “ Cinderella and the Glass
Slipper,” the delight of all childhood since
history began.

Ramses II is especially famous as the Pha-
raoh of the Oppression. In the Gizeh Mu-
seum we saw his mummy lying in state under
glass in its decorated coﬂin. Unswathed from
its sheathings of cloth, the imperial head, won-
derfully preserved, with high receding fore-
head, prominent cheekbones, and long neck
encased in stock of mummy-cloth, looked not
unlike a gentleman of the time of Washington
and Lafayette.
