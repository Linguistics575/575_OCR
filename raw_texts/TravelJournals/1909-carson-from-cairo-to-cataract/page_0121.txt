At her ﬁrst féte, Miss Chennell says she
was not fortunate enough to get inside the
throne-room: she further relates that no
sooner had the Shower of Coin occurred than
a cry of alarm came from within, “ The Prin-
cess is ill!” Almost immediately the glitter-
ing form of the pale bride loaded with gems
was brought out, half carried, half dragged
-— the weight of her jewels, the heat of the
rooms and the excitement of the ceremony
being too much for her.

The following day the Princess was borne
in procession to the home of her husband,
where during the long years of monotonous
married life the recollection of that wedding
week would become a romance of cherished
memory feeding fancy and imagination.

The poor starved lives of these pampered
women are anything but enviable. Although
indulged in jewels and dresses, stuffed with
sweet-meats and saturated with attar of rose,
these childish souls and untrained minds are
conﬁned in gilded cages, the plated bars of
which are iron underneath, the doors close-
locked, their keys kept by eunuchs with au-
thority delegated from husbands and f athers.
