Queen Thiy beside each gigantic leg, the two
mighty seated Colossi — the Memnoni of his
majesty, intended to endure until time should
be no longer; but “ He breaketh the proud
in sunderl ” Cracked and broken are now
. these images! their temples vanished utterly!
Beyond these crumbling monuments lie f rag-
ments of the once splendid sandstone stela,
thirty feet in height, formerly covered with
gold and studded with gems, which tablet had
marked the “ Station of the Pharaoh ” in his
royal shrine. On it were graven these words:
“ My majesty has done these things for mil-
lions of years, and I know that they will abide
on the earth.”

Behind the temple near the cliffs was the
imperial palace; its walls without glistening
with glazed tiles of deepest blue; and all gor-
geous within with pictured tapestry. Here
the king supped sumptuously every day, from
vessels of gold and silver, and on the lake
which he had constructed beside the palace of
his favourite wife, Amenhotep and Queen
Thiy sailed in her royal barge, “ Beauties of
Aton.” This was the Augustan Age of the
Golden City. An Egyptian Lorenzo pre-
sided over magniﬁcent Thebes.
