FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT 235

young Englishman 1n the party pointed out
several species. The wag-tail and the small
lark are the most numerous. The hoopah, a
big brown bird, larger than our robin, has a.
high red topknot and two white bars across
wings and tail. The hoopah is found all over
Egypt and must be an aborigine, for we rec-
ognized it in a. sculptured relief on one of the
most ancient temples of Abydos. Here and
there a white ibis was feeding quietly in the
alfalfa. Men were cutting the ripe cane stalk
by stalk, and laying them down one by one
on the ground — a slow process. Beyond in
the barley ﬁeld Ruth was following after the
maidens of Boaz gleaning the grain that es-
caped their sickles.

All the way we had ahead of us the great
perpendicular mountain range at the foot of
which lie the ruins of Abydos, the most sacred
necr0polis of ancient Egypt. As is Mecca
to the devout Moslem of modern times, so
was Abydos to the pious Egyptian of earlier
ages. Hither he came, during life, on a pil-
grimage to worship the most holy Osiris, and
hither he was brought after death to be buried
beside the adored deity. Through the gorge
of this very range the souls of the deceased
were supposed to pass on their way to the
barge of the sun.
