FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT 315

seas made their ﬁrst invasion of the western
Delta, and penetrated as far south as Mem-
phis, but the aged monarch had not strength
to resist them. Ramses II died in the year
1225 B. c. at the age of ninety, after occupy-
ing the throne nearly three some years and
ten.

One after another, twelve of his sons had
died, and Merneptah, the thirteenth, was al-
ready an old man, when he succeeded Ram-
ses. Palestine again revolted, and was again
subdued. The Libyans and the white races
from Eur0pe crossed a second time to Egypt,
and were a second time driven out, leaving
nine thousand of their number slain on the
black sands of the Delta. The ﬁrst mention
of Israel as a nation known in literature —
not including the Hebrew Scriptures —— is
found in Merneptah’s Song of Triumph:

“ The kings are overthrown, saying ‘ Salem 1’
Not one holds up his head among the nine nations of the bow.
Wasted is Tehenu,
The Hittite land 1s paciﬁed,
Plundered is the Canaan, with every evil.
Israel 18 desolated, his seed' 18 not,
Palestine has become a (defenceless) widow for Egypt.
Al] hands are united, they are paciﬁed;
Every one that is turbulent is bound by King Merneptah."
