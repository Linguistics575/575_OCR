Cairo,
Fn'dag, December 2nd.
J UST now the Faithful are observing the
annual fast of Ramadan, which lasts a moon,
the Moslem calendar counting thirteen months
to the year. During the four weeks every
good Mohammedan abstains from food from
sunrise till sunset, not a drop of water even
passing his lips. Indeed the code admon-
ishes the worshipper not to delay beginning
his fast until sunrise, but to refrain from
food “ from the moment there is suﬂ‘icient
light to distinguish a black thread from a
white: ” which moment is signalized by the
ﬁring of a gun from the Citadel. This mom-
ing the gun boomed an hour and three min-
utes before dawn — a long fast and thirst
for a man in active service in such a hot cli-
mate. The Moslem makes up for it after sun-
set, however, by gorgin g himself the livelong
night. The ordinance is so generally observed,
that when Ramadan falls in summer the mor-
tality is great.
