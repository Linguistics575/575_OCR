FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT 123

the heavens a rich lemon glow which was
reﬂected on sand and water. Night fell sud-
denly with almost no twilight intervening,
and it instantly turned cold. Canvas awnings
were at once let down on both sides of the
promenade deck and electric lights turned on,
making it as warm and bright as a lady’s
drawing-room.

Our other passengers are British, with the
exception of a young bride and groom from
Chicago, Mr. Simmons — the artist from
California above mentioned — a Boston edi-
tor, and a lone Spaniard with whom I have
exchanged a few words, but I ﬁnd my Span-
ish rather rusty.

One of the English tourists remarked to
me, “ You speak different than the lady from
Chicago, —- you pronounce like an English-
woman.” I could have told her there was no
doubt about her nationality — her “ different
than ” proclaiming her a Britisher at once.
