“ S. S. Rameses,”

Thursday, December 8th.

THIS afternoon we landed at Beni Hassan,
where we were greeted by a great onslaught
from the donkey-boys, who kept calling to us,
“ Here are donkeys on the stop!” The wait-
ing burros were standing ready saddled in a
long pen, those nearest the gate being fur-
nished with men’s saddles; the dragomans,
however, insisted the ladies should mount ﬁrst.
A great lashing and slashing of animals, boys
and men followed, ﬁerce altercation and much
bad Arabic, but at last we were off in a cloud
of dust, this time with two donkey-boys apiece.
I, remonstrated with Abuh, aged ﬁfteen, and
bade him send back Hassan, aged nine; but
both explained in loud voice that they were
brothers —— both had Papa Turah and Mamma
Turah, hence were indeed brothers; moreover,
the younger spoke the better English. At Sak-
karah all the donkeys were named “ Yankee
Doodle,” but at Beni Hassan I got a “ Ram-
ses ” — a far more appropriate cognomen for

an Egyptian burro. Women and childnen
