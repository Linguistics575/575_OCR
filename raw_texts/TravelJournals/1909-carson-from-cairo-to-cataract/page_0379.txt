304 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACI‘

over the then known world had given the
thinking hierarchs food for thought. Their
philosophy had variously endowed their gods.
Ptah, from being the god of builder and
smith, had come to be revered as the inventor
and maker of man and the world: “ the Mind
that fashioned: ” the Word that was spoken
“ and it was so.” Such, no doubt, was the
origin of the Egyptian “ logos,” a doctrine
adopted later by the Greeks.

Dr. Breasted well says that the Egyptians
reasoned by analogy from the Pharaoh of an
empire to a god of the world, and thus ar-
rived at the concept of a universal deity.
Each nome widened its mental horizon to
embrace the idea of one single omnipotent
spirit, but each gave that spirit the name of
its most powerful god — that of its local
shrine.

Amenhotep IV, however, broke with relig-
ious tradition, and chose for his Supreme
Deity, the name of the new god Aton, ——
signifying, not the material sun, but the heat,
the revivifying force of the slm’s rays. The
sun’s disc Ikhnaton looked upon as the win-
dow of heaven through which the one God,
the source of life on earth, shed light and
heat; each ray was accordingly drawn with
a hand holding out the sign of life.
