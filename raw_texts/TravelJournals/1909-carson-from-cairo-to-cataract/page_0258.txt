the vessel. They were packed in closely, head

at night are carried back to Luxor.

relate of his impotence in the hands of his
vicious donkey-boys; but he gleefully assured
us he’d be ready for them to-morrow, and
forthwith ﬂourished a stout whi p of rhinoce-
ros hide which he had purchased the moment
he reached Luxor.
