10 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

mid-November, bereft of their foliage, re-
peated the low shore line. There was a sense
of breadth and wideness in the landscape that
bespoke a spirit of peace and calm. As we
neared the city the long twilight with its
Norse mystery gave place to the night. By
the aid of the harbour signals the Captain
felt his way up past buoy after buoy toward
the circle of lights whose glimmering meant
Antwerp. The band played a joyous air as
the gang-plank was thrown out, and we once
more set foot on terra ﬁrma. It took so long
to get our eleven tnmks together that it was
eight o’clock before we reached the hotel.

Next morning when we visited the Cathe-
dral the exquisite little wooden ﬁgures of the
choir-stalls, so wonderfully carved, caused us
to break the tenth commandment; after nu-
merous inquiries we found the studio of Herr
Van Windt, Antwerp’s famous carver, but
unfortunately all his copies had been sold, and
he is now at work exclusively upon a set of
forty-ﬁve ﬁgures in stone for the facade of
the Cathedral.

The ﬁve o’clock evening express brought
us into Paris at ten that night. The long
ride from the Gare du Nord to the Grand
Hotel through the brilliantly lighted streets
of the French capital was most exhilarating.
