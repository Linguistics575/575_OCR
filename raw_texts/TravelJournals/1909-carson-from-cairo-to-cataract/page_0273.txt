206 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

like the elephant, has a long memory for
slights, and repays injury with interest, and
whose two humps shake you just that much
more. All the camels in Egypt seem to be
of the latter variety, one excursion on which
quite satisﬁes the tourist’s ambition to ride
this noble beast.

The Bisharin is the most picturesque ﬁgure
in Assuan, and the most primitive inhabitant
of Egypt we have encountered in our journey
through this ancient land. Tall and slender,
with long face, square brow and protruding
lower lip, he is especially conspicuous by rea-
son of the mass of kinky black hair which
bushes out like a halo all over his head, and
falls about his neck in a short thick cluster
of tiny braids terminating in a coin or a
cowrie, the whole caked with mud or matted
with castor—oil made from bushes grown by
himself. .

Scattered along the Upper Nile are nine
of these Bisharin tribes over whom the Egyp-
tian government has placed one of their own
sheiks, resident at Edfu. They are not an
agricultural people, but support themselves
by ﬁshing and by raising goats and camels,
the tending of which is the care of the chil-
dren. A good camel will bring twenty dol-
lars, United States coin.
