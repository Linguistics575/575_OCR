66 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

feet long and four square; they are ﬁtted so
closely and without the aid of mortar that it
is impossible to insert even the blade of a pen-
knife between them. This is the oldest build-
ing extant of the Egyptian empire; absolutely
bare of decoration, it is nevertheless imposing
by reason of its mass and simplicity. A well
in the court-yard yielded up seven black diorite
statues of Khafre, builder of the second Pyr-
amid. In the Cairo Museum is an unusually
ﬁne seated statue of the same king,- also in
diorite; its wonderful vivacity of expression
attests the skill attained by ancient sculptors
of this hard stone.

Miss Shinn, being timid, was one of the
last to remount and by mistake got on the
wrong camel. Thereupon ensued a ﬁerce al-
tercation between the respective camel—drivers,
some half dozen mixing in the fray; the men
ﬁnally had to be separated, but not before they
had covered themselves with blood. We were
late in reaching Cairo and were thankful for
the closed carriage which protected us from
the heavy rain then falling; yet “in Egypt
it never rains! ”
