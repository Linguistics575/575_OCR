182 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

dynasties — so aptly called “ the Westmin-
ster Abbey of Egypt.” The noonday sun
shone down upon us with tr0pical ﬁerceness.
At one point only an overhanging boulder
made a few feet of shade. Never before had
I so realized the force of the beautiful Scrip-
ture—“ Like the shadow of a great rock in
a weary land.”

0f the many sepulchres discovered in these
bills the tourist visits but four or ﬁve of the
best preserved.

Belzoni, the Paduan athlete and one of the
earliest Egyptian archwologists, graphically
describes his exploration of a tomb discovered
by him in 1817 in this very valley. After
scrambling for three or four hundred feet
over the loose stones of a hot stuffy gallery,
and having in places to crawl over sharp
rocks, he had to force his body through a
small aperture scarce a foot high. Emerging
into a cave lofty enough to permit of a sit-
ting posture, he rested his robust form on
what proved to be a rotten mummy-case
which gave way beneath his weight. Throw-
ing his shoulders back to save himself, there

came tumbling down upon him a lot of loose

legs, arms and mummy rags, while the dead
dust of bygone ages and buried kings rose
in stiﬂing clouds and ﬁlled throat and nostrils.
