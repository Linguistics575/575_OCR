FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT 11

Our one day in Paris lasted until long
after midnight, and was spent in the Louvre
Gallery, with an hour only for sh0pping. In
the evening we heard the opera of “ Sa-
lammbo,” its gorgeous Egyptian mise en
scene being a. most ﬁtting introduction to the
land of the Pharaohs, Whither we were bound.
