FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT 223

Philae to Assuan, and is merely a series of
rapids.

Toward the lower end of the Cataract we
came to the Island of Sehel, which has more
than two hundred ancient inscriptions en-
graved on the faces of its rocks. One, dating
from the Ptolemaic epoch, repeats the tradi-
tion of a low Nile lasting seven years, and
causing a seven years’ famine in the reign of
the very early King Zoser of the Third Dy-
nasty, whose tomb, the Step Pyramid, we
saw at Sakkarah. The inscription further
relates that the drought was ﬁnally broken
by making offerings to the Cataract god
Khnum, who again renewed the inundations.
This famine was two thousand years before
that recorded in the Bible as occurring in the
time of Joseph. Khnum was the great local
god of this region, and the ram the animal
specially sacred to him. A whole necropolis
of these rams has recently been unearthed by
the French on the Island of Elephantine —‘
the great stamping-ground of this god.

Many of the boulders in the river are black
as coal and must have furnished material for
the dark diorite statues now housed in the
Cairo Museum. Wherever a foot of soil ﬁnds
lodgment, there the papyrus antiquorum of
Egypt grows wild; it is the same tall reed
