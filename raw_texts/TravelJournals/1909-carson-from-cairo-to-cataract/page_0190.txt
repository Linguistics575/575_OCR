the Cairo wedding —— are of cotton or silk
net so heavily clamped with gold and silver
mat one wonders they do not tear.

is wanted we have only to clap our hands,
“ clap hands till somebody comes.” It is a

nothing to do but gaze at the ﬂying banks of
the Nile, and see village after village pass,
palm-grove after palm-grove, and cane-ﬁeld
after cane-ﬁeld swim by.

The Nile is as yellow and muddy as the
Tiber. The rich silt brought down in solution
