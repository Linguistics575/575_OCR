chase, and a lion hunt. Instead of receiving
as a god the reverent homage of his subjects,
Amenhotep adopted more democratic man-
ners, both he and his family living largely in
the public eye. Queen Thiy he consulted on
all matters of State, and her portrait appears
always in conjunction with his on the palace
walls. After thirty-six years of splendour
Amenhotep III died in 1375 B. 0., and was
laid in the little Valley of the Tombs of the
Kings where, you remember, we saw his
mummy reposing in its sarcoPhagus, — the
only one of the forty odd left in situ.

Forces had for some time been fomenting
to undermine the power of the empire. The
new sovereign Amenhotep IV was not one to
throttle them. Impractical and idealistic, the
young king was strongly inﬂuenced by his
mother, his wife, and his chosen priest. Phil-
OSOphy fascinated him. Instead of following
the lead of former hierardls, Amenhotep IV,
inﬂuenced by Thiy, ad0pted a more abstract
religion, formulated a simpler creed, and in-
augurated a purer worship — stamping his
age with his own individuality, which must
needs have been strong to overcome the en-
mity of the powerful priestly party, devoted
to the cult of Amon.
