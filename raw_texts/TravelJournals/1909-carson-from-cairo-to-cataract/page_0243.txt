Apt. Their return at nightfall is pictured

Over the glittering sands of the Libyan
Desert the laggard sun, looming large from
the distant horizon, was now fast sinking in
a golden glory, its long lines of light casting
a radiant eﬂ’ulgence upward over the whole
western heavens to the very zenith. The Nile,
made crimson by the reﬂection, rippled with
the chance zephyrs of closing day. Below in
mid-stream, outlined against the evening sky,
lay the little island from which rose a cluster
of tall palms and the folded sails of a boat
just brought to mooring for the night. Above
and around us glowed Luxor’s giant walls
and columns as in a furnace, their limestone
surface catching ﬁre from the burning rays of
the departing orb of day. A hush fell over
the company, awed to silence by the nightly
miracle of an Egyptian sunset.
