“ S. S. Rameses,”

Tuesday, December 20th.
J UBT after leaving Assuan at ﬁve this
‘ morning, we were awakened by a great shout-
ing and splashing. The ship had nm aground
and was an hour in getting oﬂ’. It has taken
two weeks to come up the river; by hard
steaming we have made ﬁve and a half miles
an hour. Returning, with wind and tide to
favour us, we will average twelve to fourteen
and cover the whole distance to Cairo in a
week. In fact so rapidly did we move to-day
that I dared not take my eyes oﬂ’ the land-
scape lest I miss something. It is like a mov-
ing panorama, except that we do the moving;
and, as the channel is often but a few feet
from shore, we can see perfectly everything
being done on land.

The farther up the Nile we go, the less
clothing the natives wear. A f ellah will stand
all day working at the well, or hoeing in the
ﬁeld, with nothing on but a turban and a loin-
cloth, the hot sun beating down on his bronze

as:
