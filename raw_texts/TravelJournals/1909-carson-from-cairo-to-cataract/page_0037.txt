a letter U by a British “ squadron of obser-
vation ” twice their strength. From the
English Channel to the Pillars of Hercules

Fleet had “ observed ” the warships of the
Czar. And at Gibraltar, the strangers were
met by Great Britain’s Mediterranean squad-
ron, which in turn acted as “ escort of obser-
vation ” the remainder of the way to Port
Said. Fast or slow, as moved the Russian,
so moved the British ﬂeet.

“ And,” concluded our Commander, “ when
night would settle over the face of the waters
and no lights show from either squadron,
while they kept up their swift race through
the darkness, we put all steam on, and our
P. and 0. easily ﬂed away before them.”
