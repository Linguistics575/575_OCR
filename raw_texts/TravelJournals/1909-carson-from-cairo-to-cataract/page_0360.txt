FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT 285

her Old Empire, Egypt launched the ﬁrst
sea-going ships of history — barring the ark
— invented the column, constructed the colon-
nade, and developed a well organized gov-
ernment and a large body of law.

A period of anarchy followed — three hun-
dred years of civil war between petty mon-
archs, — during which time many monuments
were destroyed, and some of the ﬁnest sepul-
chres; seven diorite statues of Khaf re which
adorned the Causeway Gate before the Sec-
ond Pyramid were then cast into the court-
yard well, whence they have been rescued
within the last century.

The Middle Empire opens with the Twelfth
Dynasty, whose kings bear the names of
Amenemhet and Sesostris. During the reign
of Sesostris I messages began to be sent to
and from Egypt and Palestine; this Pha-
raoh, moreover, was the ﬁrst to lead an army
in person into a foreign land, while Sesostris
III was the earliest Egyptian to invade
Syria. Sesostris III is also famous as the
builder of the splendid temples of Heli0polis,
where he erected his obelisk, and dug the
sacred lake of which he boasts:

“My beauty shall be remembered in his house;
My name is the pyramidion,
My name is the lake ”—
