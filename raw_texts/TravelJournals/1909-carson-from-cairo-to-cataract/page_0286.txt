Aswan,
Monday, December 19th.

THIS was the day reserved for the visit to
the great dam. B. and Miss Shinn went by
train to Shellal, but as we will not have many
more opportunities to ride, the Professor and
I decided to go the six miles on donkeys.
My beast was a racer and put out for the
desert at a lively gallop without waiting for
me to learn which road to take. He had spied
some riders ahead, although not of our party,
and set out to overtake them. I only hoped
they were going where I was supposed to be
going. I sawed on the bridle, but it was an
old one and beginning to split, and I had
much ado to hold the animal.

The Professor had ï¬‚ourished his rhinoceros
hide at starting and laid out two donkey boys
with a cut apiece when they attempted to
hasten his Rosinante, and left them far he-
hind. He appeared upon the horizon half
an hour later with a third who, however, kept
a respectful distance.

As we neared the little village of Shellal

we caught sight of the beautiful calyx-
