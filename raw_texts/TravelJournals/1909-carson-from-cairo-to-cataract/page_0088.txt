FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT 59

olation; on the west, dancing with ﬁery heat,
undulated the Libyan Desert, 9. dreary waste,
along the conﬁnes of which to the south of
us, dotted here and there, stood the sentinel
pyramids — masses of rock adding their
brown and yellow note to the picture of des-
olation.

In vivid contrast lay on the east the ver-
dant valley of the Nile with ﬁelds of waving
cane and tall palms interlacing above the
mud huts of the fellaheen. Northeast on the
opposite bank of the river at the end of the
long straight road of lebbek trees was the
great city of Cairo, covering an area of
eleven square miles, a mass of stone and
stucco, clustered domes and myriad minarets
showing above crumbling walls and lofty
gateways. From the limestone ridge just
south of the metr0polis the Citadel boldly
fronted us — embattled walls of gray ma-
sonry encircling the grim fortress, and the

/ splendid Alabaster Mosque of Mohammed
Ali, its pale yellow dome and tapering min-
arets piercing the sky. Still farther south
and just above the fortress rose the frowning
Mokattam cliffs of deep reddish brown, six
hundred and ﬁfty feet in height, keeping
guard over city and Citadel nestling at their
feet.
