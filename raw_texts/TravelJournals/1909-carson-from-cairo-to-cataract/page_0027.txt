8 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

out as missionaries to India. That afternoon
the Professor prevailed upon two of ‘them,
who had been in the work several years, to
tell us of their experiences in the Orient. “

Their mission in India contains about
7,000 children, mostly those who had come
to ' them during the famine, and whose parents
had died from starvation rather than lose
caste by eating foreign food.

One missionary told of going to the house
of a Hindu to teach English to a girl of
fourteen. During the lesson an old man of
sixty passed through the room, whereupon
her pupil immediately arose. In answer to
the teacher’s query as to who he was, she
replied, “ My husband.” When asked why
she was so anxious to learn English, she con-
fessed after some hesitancy, “ So that in the
next life I may be born an American woman.”

Although the list of passengers is small
there are a. number of prominent people
aboard, among whom is a member of the
Swedish Parliament, and his daughter, a tal-
ented singer.

Another interesting fellow-traveller, M.
Fontaine, of Belgium, has written a book on
Arbitration, which gives an account of all the
arbitration treaties ever made. He is also
musical and plays Ch0pin and Brahms for us.
