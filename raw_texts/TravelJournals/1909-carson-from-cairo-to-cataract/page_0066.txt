Thursday, December Ist,
Cairo.

THIS morning Mr. Richards introduced to
us Selim, our Cairo dragoman, a most im-
posing individual of portly ﬁgure, unctuous,
jealous for his reputation, demanding con-
sideration, and not to be troubled by many
triﬂing questions. He is a Copt, a Christian
like ourselves, he wishes us to understand,
and possesses but one wife. Moreover, he is
a travelled personage, having held some re-
sponsible position in the Egyptian concession,
at the Chicago Fair.

Selim to-day took us ﬁrst to the Pyramids,
driving westward across the great Nile bridge,
which is guarded by two massive bronze
lions. The bridge is open at certain hours
to allow ships to pass up the river. We hap-
pened to arrive at such a time, and found,
congregated near the approach, fashionable
him-outs, native carts, trim soldiers, swarthy
mounted police, vendors in long blue or white
robes with hand-carts of sweets or fruits, tur-
bans of every shade bobbing here and there,
