FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT 199

tian soldier, who had accompanied the party to
the min and had escorted her to the top of a
shaky pylon, now dashed up on his spirited
steed and assisted her to dismount before the
hungry little beast arrived.

We found dear Madam Shinn anxiously
awaiting our return. With the contentment
of age she enjoys the leisurely life of the boat
and spends her days on deck, the recipient of
the attentions of the whole ship, — ﬂowers,
postcards, curios and coins, all are showered
upon her. Although a ready listener to all
our exploits, she steadfastly refuses to accom-
pany us on any expedition inland. Her f a-
vourite reading is President Roosevelt’s “ Big
Game Hunting in the Rockies.” She takes
especial delight in his description of the black-
tailed deer and the white-tailed deer, which
she always describes as “ so very interesting!”

One evening after dinner, as we stood about
the deck drinking our coﬂ’ee, Madam seated
herself at the piano and began playing the
Russian hymn, to the surprise and delight of
every one. Then followed “ America,” which
pleased both her British and her American
audience, and ﬁnally she set the feet of the
young folks in motion with a sprightly jig.
