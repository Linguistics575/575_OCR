262 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

aKa. EachKahaditsownname,asis
known from the ﬁnding on the seals in the
tombs of the Pharaohs of their Ka names.
To insure to the Ka continuance of exist-
ence, the body must be preserved in its per-
fect shape. Dessication, and later mummiﬁ-
cation, were accordingly resorted to. The
poor were simply “ salted and dried,” and
wrapped in a mat of woven reeds; but the
rich went through long processes of boiling
with resinous gums and aromatic roots, and
were then enveloped in hundreds of yards of
ﬁne linen, with fragrant herbs laid between
the folds; thus “ highly spiced ” they were
laid away in their painted coﬁins. In order
to conceal the shrinkage caused by these
processes, and to make the mummy more
presentable, as well as comfortable, for the
Ka to inhabit, a mask of cartonage, or painted
linen, was made for the entire body; in the
case of royalty the mask was usually of gold.
The mummy was laid on its side, facing
the east, in a wooden cofﬁn, which was then
enclosed in a massive sarcophagus of granite
or other hard stone, often hewn from one
solid block. The lid was next cemented on
to make it air-tight. A Pharaoh could not
better recompense the services of a loyal sub-
ject than by the gift of such a sarcophagus.
