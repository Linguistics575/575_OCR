FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT 107

the Nile had lived and developed side by side
but ever separate and distinct. There was the
Upper Egypt of the South land, — its em-
blem, a lily; its sovereign, Lord of the White
Crown; its ensign, a plant; its treasury, the
“ White House; ” and its protecting patron,
the serpent-goddess, or sacred uraeus —— while
below lay the Lower Egypt of the Delta with
papyrus emblem, a Lord of the Red Crown for
king, a bee for ensign, for treasury the “ Red
House,” and for tutelary genius the vulture-
goddess, the holy hawk with outspread wings.
Both rulers bore the title “ Horus," and both
claimed to reign as sons of the hawk-headed
god, but Upper Egypt of the interior was
ever the more Egyptian of the two. Thus
the two in early ages.

In the course of time, however, at the be-
ginning of history, according to Manetho,
there arose in the thirty-ﬁfth century B. c. a
mighty man, Menes, the ﬁrst monarch of
united Egypt, or indeed of the world. Born
at Thinis near Abydos in the sOuth, he in-
vaded and conquered the land of the Red
Crown and cemented the conquest by estab-
lishing his capital at the beginning of the
Delta in the narrow part of the Nile Valley,
midway between Upper and Lower! Egypt
