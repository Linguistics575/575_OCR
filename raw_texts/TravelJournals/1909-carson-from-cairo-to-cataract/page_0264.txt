On the Nile,
Friday, December 16th.

AT ten this morning, the “ Rameses ” made
Esneh, where we stopped an hour. Climbing
' the high bank we walked through the primi-
tive little village. It was market-day and the
town-square was crowded with country folk
displaying their wares; clay pipes and bowls,
bright slippers and tinselled scarf 3, were
spread all over the ground. In one corner
sat a maiden buying a red glass bangle. She
had to soap her hand, and squeeze and squeeze,
to force it over her knuckles — once on, it
need never come oﬂ’ and would be a joy for
ever.

A large escort self -appointed followed us
the short distance to the Temple of Esneh.
The building was entirely buried. A long
ﬂight of steps led down into the lofty central
hall, the only portion excavated. The present
ediﬁce dates from the time of the Roman
Empire, and in architecture and decoration
resembles that of Denderah, the has-relief s on
wall and column being likewise f our-tiered.
