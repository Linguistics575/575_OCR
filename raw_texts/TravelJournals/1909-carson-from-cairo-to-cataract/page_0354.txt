FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT 279

mat, lie on their left sides bodies with knees
crowded up to the chin in the attitude pewl-
iar to the period. Beside each corpse are a
few ﬂints, pieces of polished pottery and bits
of copper. Earthenware of this age — a
black and red pottery decorated with red con-
centric rings on a white ground—has also
been found between Abydos and Edfu.

Although the Neolithic Age probably
closed 5000 B. 0., stone axe-heads, made in
imitation of c0pper, continued until the
Twelfth Dynasty, 3000 years later; after
which time the only such implement employed
was the ceremonial knife, “ the EthiOpian
Stone ” of Herodotus, used in making the
ﬁrst incision in a dead body, preparatory to
embalmment; no such curious knife, how-
ever, is extant.

To the period just preceding the monarchy
is to be assigned not only a very perfect and
highly ornamented buﬂ’ pottery shaped by
hand before the invention of the wheel, but
also the ﬁnest ﬂint knives in the world with
handles of gold, and blades engraved with
the same precious metal. Poor copies of these
superb tools have also been found; they have
proved to be archaistic ﬂints made during the
Twelfth Dynasty to gratify the antiquarian
taste aﬁected by that age.
