On the N ile,

Saturday, December 17th.
. THIS morning early we passed through the
narrow gorge of Silsileh, glimpses of which
we got through our cabin-windows while
dressing. The formation here changes to
limestone, and it is from these cliffs that

to visit the Temple of Kom Ombo, which is

overlooking the river. The propylwa has
been washed away by the Nile, but the build-

being dedicated to two deities â€” to Horus the
hawk-headed god and to Sobk the crocodile-

and vestibules, but also two inner sanctuaries,
side by side. As we paused near the entrance
to the little Birth House we were surprised
