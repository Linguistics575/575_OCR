4:0 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

crocodiles on their heads, and carrying trays
of scarabs and amulets manufactured in Bir-
mingham in their hands, followed us like
hawks, grinning at us as they darted across
our path every few moments to present their
wares. It was in this same crowd, before he
had gone a dozen steps from the hotel this
morning, that the Prof essor had his watch
stolen. By the aid of the police, however,
he recovered it, but not before he had landed
in jail a gang of ﬁve newsboys, organized
thieves. Now the Professor wears his time-
piece pinned conspicuously in his watch-
pocket with a big white safety-pin.

At the table d’hote to-night, which was at
the fashionable hour of eight, we found the
guests mostly English with some few from out-
of -the-way corners of Europe. A big blond
German rubbed shoulders with a dainty
French count, the ﬁerce grizzled Russian
with the slender effervescent Italian, while
next the artist with open collar and wide tie
sat a long-haired archaeologist, lost in rev-
erie over ages long gone by. The ladies all.
were gowned in gorgeous toilets, while a few
British ofﬁcers in short scarlet jackets and
red-striped trousers added brilliance to the
scene. .
