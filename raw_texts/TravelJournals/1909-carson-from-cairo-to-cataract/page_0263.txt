196 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

and nomenclature -- all manufactured in Bir-
mingham without doubt, but most satisfac-
tory to the gentleman from Chicago, who
breathed a deep sigh, as he exclaimed: “ By
Jove, but it’s a relief to have those fellows off
my mind, they’ve been worrying me ever since
I landed in Egypt!”

“Do come and see this big blue beetle!”
called Octavia. “ Isn’t it a dear? The very
thing for a pendant! and these sweet little
scarabs an inch long will make ﬁne hat-pins
for the girls!” Then addressing the anti-
quary, the bride gave her order: “ I’ll take
this splendid big blue scarab and four dozen
of those dainty bug hat-pins.”

And yet foreign residents complain of the
incurable mendacity of the native dealer!
Their own gullibility never seems to occur to
them. The government forbids the sale or
export of antiquities and posts placards to
this effect in all public places.

Again toward the close of day we wan-
dered through the columned aisles of Luxor’s
Temple, past its standing giants and en-
throned colossi, and at sunset reached the high
bluff on the river bank where the Egyptian
women congregate nightly with their pictur-
esque jars.
