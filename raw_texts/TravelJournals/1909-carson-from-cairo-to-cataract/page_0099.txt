 

68 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

Moslem substitutes, “ If Allah spare my
life!” and even the ancient Egyptian deliv-
ered himself in like phrase: “If Ammon
spare my life!”

In Egypt there are three Sabbaths; Fri-
day for the Mohammedan; Saturday for the
Jew; and Sunday for the Christian. This
being Friday, every other tourist in Cairo,
like ourselves, drove to the plaza to see the
Khedive on his weekly visit to the mosque.
All the native population were on foot, bound
for the same place. Men in long ﬂowing
robes of white or deep blue, some with red
tarbushas, some with white turbans, passed
along the narrow way that led down into a
dilapidated quarter of Old Cairo, the street
being lined temporarily with red poles from
which ﬂuttered triangular banners of crim-
son cloth. Women crouched on every roof
observing the crowd, but sadly and from
afar, for religion was not for them. Tiny
naked children rode astride a shoulder of
their mother, their little hands resting on her
head. The women wore the usual black veil,
but the only feature really hidden by the
drapery was the mouth — which every E gyp-
tian woman is most careful to conceal. Some
of the veils were heavy with silver coin, their
owner’s fortune.
