FROM CAIRO TO THE 'CATARACT 105

clear of the wharf, singing in unison as they
worked.

Our start was made promptly at ten, and
tiﬂ‘in was served early, at half after eleven,
in order that we might have time for the
long excursion from Bedrechen to Sakkarah
six .miles distant. The moment the vessel
came to land we hurried ashore to secure
good donkeys. We were immediately sur-
rounded by a shouting, jostling mob of Arabs
and donkey-boys urging us to hire their beasts
— the burros backing into us meanwhile, until
in desperation we chose the nearest. Our
dragoman, Haﬁz, or Ahmed, his assistant,
helped us jump into our saddles; and we were
soon oﬂ’, our runners at our heels.

A ﬁeld of pampas-grass we passed re-
minded me of home. The ﬁrst thing I knew,
my donkey was running into that of a dig-
niﬁed white-haired gentleman and pushing it
off the path; none of my sawing or pulling
would correct the manners of my mount.
The gentleman forgave the discourtesy, and
we were soon comparing the climates of Cairo
and San Diego, Mr. Simmons’ home, to the
detriment of the Egyptian capital. The rest
of the company, no doubt, credited us with
the usual California egotism.
