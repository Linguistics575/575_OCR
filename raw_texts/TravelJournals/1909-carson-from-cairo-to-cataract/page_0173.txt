“ S. S. Ramses,” on the Nile,
Wednesday, December 7th.

TO-DAY we did not leave the ship, but have
rested, written letters, promenaded the deck,
and watched the scenery ﬂy by, the channel
being close in shore. We Mve had a perfect
panorama of palms all day. You mustn’t
get tired of hearing about palms, for they’re
all there is in the shape of trees. So far the
big dom palm and the date are the only vari-
eties in evidence. The latter, stripped of all
but the topmost branches, dominates every-
where ".— not in small clumps, but by the
thousand, forming a perfect forest of tall,
spindling trees. Sometimes a cluster of seven
will rise from one stump. The vista into the
groves seems strangely clean and clear, for
there is no under-brush, the trees rising
straight and free from the yellow earth. The
fellah values his date palm at a thousand pias-
tres, ﬁfty American dollars. The natives
build fences of cane about them, to protect
the dates while drying from the depredations

of wild animals, — hyenas, wolves and jackals.
