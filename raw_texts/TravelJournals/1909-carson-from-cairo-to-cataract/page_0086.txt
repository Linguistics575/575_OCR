FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT 57

south. The three small pyramids to the east,
in line with the parent pile, were the tombs
of members of the royal family.

Khaf re (Kbephren) , who came to the
throne eight years later, was the builder of
the Second Pyramid, the lower layer of which
is of the more costly granite of the ﬁrst Cat-
aract; otherwise the monument is smaller and
of far inferior workmanship. The remains of
its causeway leading to the edge of the pla-
te9.u still exist, also this royal road’s splendid
granite Gateway —— long erroneously named
“ The Temple of the Sphinx.”

The nice measurement requisite for the
building of the Pyramids, and the ﬁne ﬁtting
of faces to the points of the compass, de-
manded a proﬁciency of geometrical skill, the
deveIOpment of which the Greeks attributed
to the necessity the Egyptian was under each
year to re-survey his ﬁeld after the oblitera:
tion of landmarks by the annual inundation
of the Nile.

“ Ting-a-ling-a-ling,” called B. “ Din-
ner’s ready,” and as I turned from the pan-
orama of sand and sky, there on the apex
of the Pyramid the Arabs were serving hot
coffee, made by the water carrier while we
drew breath, and very acceptable it was after
our fatiguing exertions.
