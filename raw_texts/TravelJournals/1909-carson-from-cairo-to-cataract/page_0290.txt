FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT 217

shrine’s most holy chapel, the Osiris chamber.
On its walls are frescoed the story of the
god’s death and resurrection. The several
parts of his body, said to be buried in f our-
teen separate places, are suggested by vari-
ous drawings, — a mitred crown, a head sur-
mounting a column, an arm and head resting
on a stela, a pair of legs reposing on a pylon.
, Lower down four canopic jars are pic-

tured, supporting a bier on which lies the
mummy of the god. Beyond again the body
of Osiris is seen hedged about with blos-
soming lotus buds rising on slender stalks —
the lotus the emblem of eternal life. A
third couch discovers the lifeless form at the
moment of returning consciousness, with head,
left arm, and leg uplifted, as if in an effort
to rise. Above the body poises the winged
Nephthys, breathing upon Osiris the breath
of life, while beside him stands the sublime
Isis calling to him with outstretched arms to
awake from his long sleep to the endless bliss
of immortality. This is the most beautiful
and precious of all the legends of ancient
Egypt. By no more sacred oath could the
Egyptian swear than “ By him who sleeps at
Philm! ”
