On the N ile.

Saturday, December 24th.

THIS morning we went ashore at a deserted
spot to view an ancient pavement of the
ruined city of Tell el-Amarna. As we came
to mooring we saw a row of natives squatting
like roosting chickens on the bank above the
boat. When we reached the top of the foot-
path the spectators rose as one man, and sur-
rounded our party. Four brawny Arabs,
armed with long riﬂes, now stepped in front
of us and led the way, keeping oﬂ’ the rabble
of men, women and children. We crossed a
ﬁeld of growing wheat to a low stone house
which had been erected over the relics of
pavement to keep it from being carried away
by the thieving population. These guards
are necessary to safe-guard both ﬂoor and
visiting tourist. The pavement consists of
four or ﬁve sections of painted stucco, which
had been laid about B. c. 1850 by Amenho-
tep IV, (Ikhnaton) , the Heretic king before
mentioned, who introduced the worship of the

Rays of the Sun.
