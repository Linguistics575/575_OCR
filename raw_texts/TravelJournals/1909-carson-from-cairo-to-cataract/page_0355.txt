280 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

The antiquity of iron in Egypt is likewise
assured by the ﬁnding of a piece of wrought

an air shaft of the Great Pyramid, where it
must have been lying nearly 3,000 years.
Further evidence of the age of this metal was
obtained in 1902 by Prof. Petrie, who discov-

and establishes the fact that the Age of Iron
