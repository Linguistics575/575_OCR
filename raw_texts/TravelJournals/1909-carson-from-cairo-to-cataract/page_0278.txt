Finally at the foot of a low rocky ridge we
left the carriages and plodded on on foot
through deep sand to inspect the great boulders
and masses of grayish pink rock which form
the quarry of Assuan. It is an exceedingly
hard stone, and from this ridge most of the
granite blocks, statues, and obelisks of the
temples of Lower Egypt had been hewn. We
saw many right-angled niches from which
square slabs had been cut. The mark of the
wedge is noticeable everywhere; a series of
holes two or three inches deep had been drilled
in the stone; wooden wedges inserted and
water poured over them; the swelling of the
wood split the stone in a clean straight line.
The Egyptian artisans were skilful mechanics,
their masons using a bronze tool with a sharp
edge. They were also early acquainted with
the tubular drill set with jewelled teeth, and
their work has never been surpassed. '

partly detached, and with its lower twenty
feet still buried in sand, a huge obelisk ninety
