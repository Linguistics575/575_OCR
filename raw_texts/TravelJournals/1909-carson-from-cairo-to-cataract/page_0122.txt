FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT 87

Without implements or books, with employ-
ment neither for hand or mind, all glimpse
of the world without hidden by high palace
walls, these Mohammedan women are limited
to the little ï¬‚owered courts of their harems.

shuttered blinds obstruct their View; and if
indulged to the extent of an opera, the bril-
liance of the performance is dulled by the
screen of lace across their box.
