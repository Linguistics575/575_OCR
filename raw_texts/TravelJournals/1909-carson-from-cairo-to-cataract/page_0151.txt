To make a site for the city, Menes changed
the channel so that the river ﬂowed to the
east, and thus formed a barrier against the
aggressive peoples of Mesopotamia and Syria.
Menes reigned long and his successors ruled
in prosperity over the united country more
than four hundred years, but the tradition of
two lands remained long indelible; the king
was always “ the double lord,” his diadem
“ the double crown.” Menes was deiﬁed dur-
ing life, being called “ The God ”—his min-
isters of ﬁnance, “ The two treasurers of the
God ” — titles continued for centuries. Be-
cause of its great wall, painted with white
stucco, the city was called the “ White Wall ”
in reference to the power of its conqueror,
the Lord of the “ White Crown.” This po-
etic name was retained until Pepi I, a power-
ful Pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty, erected
his pyramid-city so close to the ancient cap-
ital that the “ White Wall ” thereafter took
the name of the pyramid —— Men-nofer, which
the Greeks translated “ Memphis.”

Sakkarah, the Necr0polis of ancient Mem-
phis, extended over forty-ﬁve square miles, and
included within its conﬁnes these seventy gi-
gantic cairns, the Pyramids of the “Pharaohs.
