172 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

height. The inscription relates that it was
hewn, transported and set up, all within the
short space of seven months. Its pointed
shaft, formerly tipped with shining copper,
was one of the many monuments of ancient
Thebes which gained for that metropolis the
title of the Golden City.

In an inner court stand two granite pillars;
the one on the south, graven with a lily, typi-
ﬁes Upper Egypt; while that on the north
bears the papyrus of the Lower Nile. Thanks
to the dry Egyptian climate the edges of
these inscriptions are as sharp and clear to-
day as when ﬁrst cut, more than 8000 years
ago, while the writing on the transported Cleo-
patra needle has in the moist climate of New
York crumbled in less than a century.

The holy of holies, of which the walls only
remain, is a restoration by the Greeks. Bits
of its roof strewn over the court show yellow
stars upon a blue ground. Of the innumer-
able statues, reliefs and columns, heroic and
colossal — many of them usurpations by later
potentates who erased the original inscrip-
tion and rededicated the monument to them-
selves —— I have said nothing. The whole is a
vast mine of history, art and archeology, that
one longs to linger over and seeks in vain to
unravel.
