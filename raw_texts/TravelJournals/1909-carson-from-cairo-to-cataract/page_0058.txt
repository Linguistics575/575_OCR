FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT 37

in long, ﬂowing robes of deep blue or black;
while the chamber-boys of our hotel wear
costumes of white cotton — for all the world
like night-shirts. Many of the men are tall
and slender with small heads and ﬁne f ea-
tures. All have a digniﬁed bearing and the
better class are decidedly aristocratic.

The ﬁrst concession to European dress the
native makes is to lay aside the huge yellow
paddles — which by courtesy we call slippers
— for a civilized shoe or gaiter. Then in-
stead of his splendid, all-enveloping outer
robe he assumes a European overcoat; grad-
ually his under robe grows shorter and
shorter and ﬁnally he dons trousers. This
is his last concession; to his tarbush — a
taller fez with dark blue tassel — he clings,
never parting from it except to sleep, for it
is the peculiar badge of the disciple of Mo-
hammed. Over the tarth many wind a
turban. The orthodox turban among the
Arabs is a goodly piece of cloth; it must reach
seven times around the head, a length equiva-
lent to that of the body, in order that it may
serve as its owner’s winding-sheet, and thereby
accustom him to the thought of death. The
descendant of Mohammed wears a white tur-
ban, while the Hajis who has made pilgrim-
age to Mecca is entitled to a green one.
