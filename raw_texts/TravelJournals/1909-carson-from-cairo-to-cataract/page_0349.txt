274 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

mummy to take the place of that organ,
which was always removed and sealed in one
of the four canopic jars. The thirtieth chap-
ter of the Book of the Dead recited over this
charm prevented the heart from appearing at
the day of judgment, to bear witness against
its former owner. Little ﬁgures of wood, or
of limestone, in the form of a hawk with
human head and hands, typiﬁed the soul, and
was “ seated upon the breast of the defunct
with hands upon its heart, in order to restore
life to it.”

The Egyptian word for scarabaeus being
the same as the verb “ to be,” led to the scarab
being ad0pted as the symbol of existence. It
also typiﬁed the heart —— without which man
could not exist. This charm was worn by
living as well as dead, and was always placed
in the mummy wrappings. “ The scarab
upon the breast is the image of the transfor-
mations by which creation is continually re-
newed.” A ﬂying scarab, with Wings at-
tached by thread to its body, was fastened
to the necklace on the breast of the mummy;
it typiﬁed the sun on his diurnal passage
across the heavens, and secured for the Ka of
the mummy the power of entering into the
day and departing out of it with the sun.
