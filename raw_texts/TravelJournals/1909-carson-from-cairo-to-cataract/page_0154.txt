FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT 109

Memphis maintained its supremacy till Thebes
and the worship of the Theban god, Am-
on-Re, of Upper Egypt, superseded it
2000 B. c.

A little farther on, we came upon the fa-
mous fallen Colossi of Ramses the Great,
recumbent statues which long lay half buried
in the mud of the sacred lake adjoining the
Temple of Ptah. The larger ﬁgure, which
is 42 feet long, is now protected by a wooden
shed. Climbing a high stairway, we looked
down upon the prostrate giant. The huge
form lay vast and neglected on the desert
sand. The haughty granite features wore a
look of austere dignity. Was it of this Co-
lossus Shelley wrote the sonnet, “ Ozyman-
dia? ”

u I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: ‘Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown
And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.
And on the pedestal these words appear:
“ My name is Ozymandias, king of kings ;
Look on my works, ye mighty and despair ;”
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bars,
The lone and level sands stretch far away!"
