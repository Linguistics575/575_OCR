crowned columns, temples and kiosque of
picturesque Philm rising golden-brown from
the centre of what seemed to be a great lake.
It was the vast reservoir conﬁned by the
massive wall of the dam across its southern
outlet.

The Nile reaches its maximum level the
last of October, when it measures, at the foot
of the First Cataract, a rise of ﬁfty feet above
low water mark, while at Cairo the tide
touches but half that height.

Canopied barges, gay with red cushions,
and with tiny scarlet pennants dressing the
ropes, conveyed us to the island, which the
natives have localized as the scene from “ The
Thousand and One Nights,” relating to the
Vizier’s imprisonment of his beautiful daugh-
ter Zahr-el-ward, Flower of the Rose, to keep
her from the attention of the king’s favourite.
In the end the lovers married and were happy
ever after.

In ancient times Philaa was just over the
Nubian line, and not included in Egyptian
- territory. Even Herodotus fails to chronicle
it. During the reign of the Ptolemies Nubia
was a powerful independent kingdom, em-
bracing all modern Nubia and the northern
Soudan, and was ruled by queens bearing the
title of Candace.
