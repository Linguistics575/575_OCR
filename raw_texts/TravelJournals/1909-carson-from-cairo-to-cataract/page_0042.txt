travelled the length and breadth of Europe,
delivering his invitations in person. To the
Viceroy’s dismay the Sultan of Turkey, the
real Sovereign of Egypt, at once signiﬁed
his intention to attend. The poor Khedive
saw his part on the programme relegated to
that of a mere vassal attendant on his liege,
a satellite eclipsed by the sun, and suffered
a most miserable quarter of an hour until the
Turkish Vizier persuaded the Sultan of the
unwisdom of the journey: again the Vice-
roy’s star was in the ascendant.

“ Affairs in France being then in too critical
a state to permit Napoleon III to leave his
realm, he sent the Empress Eugenie as a
ﬁtting representative of his country’s appre-
ciation of the unparalleled achievement of
her illustrious son, M. Ferdinand de Lesseps.
The charming young Empress of France, then
at the height of her beauty, power, and pop-
ularity, sailed on the war steamer ‘ L’Aigle ’
accompanied by a French squadron of escort.
