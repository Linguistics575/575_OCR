298 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

the Philistine tradition of an emigration from
Crete, occurring, doubtless, on the disinte—
gration of the kingdom of King Minos. Go-
liath, the champion of the Philistines, was
then a Greek, a Pelasgian from Crete.

Such are the inferences to be deduced from
the tomb paintings, made in 1500 B. c. and
preserved to modern times by the marvellous
dryness of the Egyptian atm03phere.

But to return: On his thirtieth anniversary
of accession Thutmose III celebrated the
usual jubilee, erecting at Karnak the regula-
tion pair of obelisks, feasting the Egyptians
for weeks, and dividing among the p0pulace
the rich Spoils of many conquests. Between
battles this strenuous monarch occasionally al-
lowed himself the diversion of an elephant
hunt. Once, when engaged in this sport, he
was attacked by an infuriated beast, from
which he was barely rescued by a brave gen-
eral, who, rushing in, cut off the tusks of the
animal, and then hastily hid between two
boulders before the monster could injure him.

The hardy king was seventy years of age
when he engaged in his ﬁnal campaign, dur-
ing which he destroyed Kadesh, the last
stronghold of the Shepherd Kings. With this
defeat' the name of Hyksos disappears from
history.
