188 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

astride — “ Now hold me on, and now wait
for the rest of the party! ”

Returning we climbed a steep narrow path
over the Libyan range, walking all the way;
ﬁrst, because it was too steep to ride up, and
then because it was too steep to ride down.
My mite of a boy played the gallant ama-
zingly well, holding my arm with one hand
to assist me over the stones, while leading the
donkey with the other.

The broad stone Rest-house close to the
barren cliffs was a welcome sight. Here we
had luncheon sent over from the ship. While
we rested the Arabs displayed their relics,
among which was the bone handle of a sha-
ving-brush —— a souvenir of some archaeolo-
gist’s visit, no doubt.

Near by are the remains of the Funerary
Temple of the famous Queen Hatshepsut.
Long ramps with broad ﬂights of steps lead
to three wide colonnaded terraces rising one
above another. The Temple contains bas-
reliefs illustrative of the successful expedition
to Punt made during the reign of this Queen.
Hatshepsut ascended the throne at an early
age and is always represented in male attire
and with beard, and all references to her em-
ploy the masculine pronoun, excepting when
she is apotheosized as a goddess.
