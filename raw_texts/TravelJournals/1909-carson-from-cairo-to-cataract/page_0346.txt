were allowed to enter the bark under the
guidance of the god.

During the later Theban period it was the
custom to go or send to Abydos, and dedicate
a stela to one’s self, or one’s relatives. Thus
the stela came to be regarded as a sort of
resting-place of the soul on its way to the
barge of the sun. Instance the following:

“ As he passes, loaded with offerings, with
' the servants of Osiris, the Lords of Mendes
exalt him, and the great ones of Abydos ap-
plaud him. He has put his hand to the helm
in the barge of the Sun, upon the ways of
the west, and the Lords of Abydos have said
to him, Go in peace! ”

On the stela is sculptured the solar disc
with wide-spreading wings to indicate that
the Ka, or bird-soul, is no longer conﬁned in
the tomb, but accompanies the sun by day
and by night. Below it are the two eyes of
the dead and of heaven — the right eye em-
blematic of the sun, and left of the moon.
Space on the stela is then given to the many
gods, to whom the table of offerings is now
made, with an invocation exhorting them to
share their gifts with the Ka of the deceased,
since it may be absent in any one of their
domains.
