6 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

seven, and by nine were well on our way to
the boat with bags and trunks piled high on
the carriage. Mr. Richards was awaiting us
and at once conducted us to our cabin.

We then met the three other members of
our party. Madam Shinn, aged 77 . widow
of a former prominent member of the New
York bar, is a lady of ﬁne features and dis-
tinguished manners. Although slightly deaf
and unable to walk far, she seems equal to the
exigencies of travel. In her fur hood and
long black cloak she looks like an Eskimo,
while her delicate pink and white complexion
is as fair and fresh as any girl’s. This is her
twenty-third trip across the water. Miss
Martha, her daughter, middle-aged and prac-
tical, is devoted to her mother.

Lastly there is the Professor, an old friend
of these ladies and most chivalrous in his at-
tention to Madam Shinn, leading her about as
tenderly as a child. He not only calls her
“ Honey ” and “ Dear ” -—he is from Texas
-—but “ Sisters” us, and “ Brothers” Rich-
ards and the passengers generally, to the in-
ﬁnite amusement of all. Soon after we were
introduced, the Professor said, “ Now, Rich-
ards, you take care of the young ladies and
I’ll look after the old ones! ”
