king is seldom the winner.

The pale-faced dapper little ship’s Sur-
geon, in correct corduroy and leather leg-
gings, has been most courteous to all, playing
the host well. in lieu of a Captain, of which
ofﬁcer the force is innocent. The Doctor as-
sists the ladies to mount and is always on
hand when the donkeys stumble, or their
riders fall. Every pretty girl receives some
attention, and the younger the girl, the more
fascinating he ﬁnds her. A saucy Irish las-
sie with laughing blue eyes and retroussé
nose, her face framed in a bewitching poke
bonnet of red, led him a dance. He was her
slave the two days of her voyage from Luxor
to Assuan. Next morning, however, found
him devoting himself to another maiden, to
whom he criticised Peggy most unmercifully.
