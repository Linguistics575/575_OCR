Cairo,
Wednesday evening, N ovember 30th. ,

CAIRO is the western metropolis of the
Orient and a most cosmopolitan city. Its
wonderful climate makes it the winter resort
of thousands of Europeans and Americans,
while its sunny skies and its wise administra-
tion by the British make it the favourite home
of the wealthy Asiatic, be he Turk, Syrian
or Jew — all build splendid palaces of stone
or stucco along the broad avenues of the
modern city. The native quarter, a hive of
narrow lanes with lofty minarets and shining
domes shut in by small shops and dingy
dwellings, is a place quite apart.

It is comical to see these Nubians, black
as night, trigged out in the heavy cloth uni-
form of the English police, all except the
helmet. The street-car force, also Egyptian,
appear very clumsy in their Eur0pean dress.
Mansﬁeld Pasha is the head of the Cairene
police force. The British give the minor
positions to natives and reserve the imPOrtant

oﬁces for themselves.
