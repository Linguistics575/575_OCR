250 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

“ Who then in inﬂuence and looks
And in the learning of the books.
Will second only be to “ Cooks ”?
But Claudius! ”

Claudius said he would commit the lines to
memory and recite them to us. Ahmed
laughed at him, and said the English was
“ too high ” for him, and that he would never
be able to master it. But Claudius sat up
most of the night studying the stanzas. This
evening at dinner he made his farewell speech,
wishing us “ Bon voyage,” and expressing
the hape that we would come again to the
Nile, and that he might have the pleasure of
once more escorting us over the ruins. He
closed by reciting the verses above mentioned,
modestly omitting the last line of each.
