fascinating. Although it is but three, tea is
being served on deck—a last courtesy from
the ship. Already the domes and minarets
of the Citadel are in sight, while the grim
Pyramids have been hovering in the western
distance for some hours past. The river is
crowded with blue-bordered sails all bound
for Cairo. As we bear down upon ﬂeet after
ﬂeet, they part and let us pass. The palaces
and gardens of the eastern bank now ﬂy by,
and at last we come to anchor, just this side
the great Nile bridge.

THE END.
