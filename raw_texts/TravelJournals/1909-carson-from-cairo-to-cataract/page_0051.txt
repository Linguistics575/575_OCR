32 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

bodies swathed in multitudinous folds of bril-
liant hue — pressed round us.

A babel of strange tongues broke forth on
the air. With some trepidation our little
party stepped upon the platform, and were
taken in charge by the head porter of the
Grand Hotel Continental, dressed in regula-
tion blue uniform and brass buttons, his
Egyptian blood betokened by his red fez.
Victorias were in waiting and we were soon
clattering noisily at neck-break speed through
the deserted streets of Cairo, passing occa-
sionally a poor merchant asleep on a bundle
of dried palm leaves before his locked cup-
board of a sh0p, — the southern stars with
unwonted brilliance shining down upon us
from the deep midnight sky.

The wide glass doors of the hotel opened
automatically at our approach. Within stood
two attendants in crimson robes. They wore
long baggy trousers of yards and yards of
cloth pleated about the waist and gathered
in a pouch at the tops of black gaiters, zouave
jackets and belts a mass of gold broidery,
and the inevitable tarbush, the Egyptian fez.
These were but two of an army of servants
whose picturesqueness gave the touch of Ori-
ental splendour for which our imagination

longed.
