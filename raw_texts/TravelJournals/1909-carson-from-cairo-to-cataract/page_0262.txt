FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT 195

We were bmk in time for tiﬂin and spent
the afternoon visiting the down steamer which
returned this morning from Assuan and was
anchored near by, and in inspecting curio
sh0ps. Every one bought enamelled lotus
hat-pins and brooches of real green beetles.
The bridal couple from Chicago were espe-
cially fascinated by the pseudo-antique amu-
lets.

“ See here, Octavia, what do you think of
this green cartouche? ” — a stone two inches
long and half as wide engraved with curious
hieroglyphics — “ The man says it’s a genu-
ine old one — came from the mummy of
Ramses the Great: it’s only eight dollars.
Make a ﬁne seal for a fob, wouldn’t it? Your
brother, Bob, might like one! — something
rare and unusual — and the fellows at the
club too! Oh! I sayl”——turning to the
dealer — “ have you any more of these car-
touches? Are they all royal? You guaran-
tee them all ancient and royal? Well, then
let me have twenty-two of them!”

“ Very well, your honour,” replied the
obliging merchant, “it fortunate I can give
you; I have ver’ rare, ver’ exclusive cartouche,
very genueene! ” emphasizing the last sylla-
ble, as he produced from a special drawer
twenty-two green stones of identical colour
