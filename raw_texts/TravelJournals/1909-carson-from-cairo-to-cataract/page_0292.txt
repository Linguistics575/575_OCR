FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT 219

plcted December 10, 1902. Its hundred and
eighty sluices, averaging twenty-three feet in
width, are arranged on four different levels.
Part of the sluices only were Open, and the
water poured through these with tremendous
force, forming far ﬁner cataracts than the
natural one below. A canal and four locks
thirty feet wide has been made on one side
the dam, for the passage of ships to the Up-
per Nile. The river begins to rise in July
and by the end of November the sluice gates
are closed one after another. Toward the
last of February the reservoir is full. The
water is distributed by the ﬁrst of July when
the river is again at normal level.

The engineers thought the water of the
reservoir should be a hundred and fourteen
metres above sea-level in order to impound
sufﬁcient for irrigating the country, but out
of deference to the archaeologists, who wished
to protect Philaa from inundation, they made
it only a hundred and six metres high, with
the result that Egypt clamours for another
dam, and Philae is ﬂooded most of the year.

'- Behold how nature mocketh at man’s vain
efforts to improve her workmanship! This
Assuan dam which was to furnish an inex-
haustible supply of water, and abolish famine
in Egypt, is now cursed with all the fervour
