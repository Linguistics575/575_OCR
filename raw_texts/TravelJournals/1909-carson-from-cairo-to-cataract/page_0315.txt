. 24o FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

ther into the desert to inspect ruins of tombs
and temples, all in a state of great decay.
Beyond is a quaint little COPtic monastery
where a group of small boys from six to eight
years of age recited for us in English the
Twenty-third Psalm. The eagerness of these
poor people to learn English is pathetic. The
chapel and dwellings surrounding were mis-
erably poverty-stricken.

Since 1896 M. de Morgan, M. Amelineau
and Professor Petrie have been excavating in
the region of Abydos. They have found
some pre-historie tombs of kings of the First
and Second Dynasties and others thought to
be pre-dynastic.

In twos and threes we came straggling
back to the ship in the late afternoon, weary
with the long seventeen mile ride â€”- our last
in the land of the Nile.
