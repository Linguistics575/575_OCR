- Cairo,

Saturday, December 3rd.

TO-DAY we visited the great University
Mosque. Students from Arabia, Persia, and
all the Moslem world come here to study the
Koran. The course is from four to six years.
No native women are allowed within the
mosque, but exception is made in favour of
foreigners. A tall, stout warden, stick in .
hand, saw to it that we had slippers tied over
our shoes before we were permitted to put
foot even in the vestibule. The latter Opened
on a large quadrangular court entirely sur-
rounded by an arcade, under which were
groups of students sitting cross-legged on the
pavement in circles about their teachers, re-
ceiving instruction or reciting chapters from
Koran. As they recited they swayed back
and forth to emphasize the rhythm and assist
their memory. Here and there isolated Ô¨Åg-
ures were studying aloud, rocking themselves
to the cadence of the passages. It was a
perfect bedlam. Not only the court but the
whole interior of the mosque was given over
