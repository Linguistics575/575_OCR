showing an attempt to knit together, proved

Not far from the Serapeum is the famous
Mastaba of Thi, four thousand six hundred
years old. Not only is it one of the best pre-
served tombs in all the valley of the Nile, but
the has-reliefs mark the climax of Egyptian
art. Thi was Royal Architect and Manager
of Pyramids to a king of the Fifth Dynasty.

Formerly this Mastaba stood above ground;
it is now entirely buried with sand from the
wind-swept desert. The interior has been
excavated; its walls are covered with remark-
ably realistic scenes from the country life of
the deceased, all instinct with the joy of life.
The hieroglyphics are beautifully executed,
the lines deeply cut and well-spaced. The
entrance is a small vestibule containing two
pillars before which stands a statue of Thi
in long wig and short apron, a staÔ¨Å in one
hand, a club in the other. Just to the left
is a closed chamber called a serdab, which
contains several more statues of Thi, and to
which the only communication is by a small
cleft barely wide enough to pass a hand to
admit incense.
