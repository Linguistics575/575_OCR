Apmpos of harems: An amusing incident
happened to Mr. and Mrs. Gorham and their
friend, Miss Cox, guests at our hotel. They
were told that one passport would sufﬁce for
the three on their recent trip through Pales-

that it was made out in true Oriental fashion:
“ Gorham Pasha and harem,” which resulted
in somewhat mixed feelings in the whole trio
as to just who was who. Moreover the gen-
tleman in question, being of an independent
American spirit, objected to the waste of
time incident to having this precious docu-
ment viséed every time the party entered or
left a town; so when they arrived at Damas-

preliminary, the Pasha was arrested and
thrown into prison, and his harem, between
them, had to put up a good round sum to
bail him out.
