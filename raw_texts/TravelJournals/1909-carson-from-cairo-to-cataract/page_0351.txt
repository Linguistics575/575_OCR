276 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARAUI‘

the dawn of Egyptian history. The dead
were identiﬁed with Osiris, and are called
Osiris. An invocation made by the scribe,
Ani, to Osiris corroborates this:

“ Grant that I may be an Osiris, greatly
favoured of the beautiful god ” (Osiris).

Over his table of offerings, also, is the title
of the dead—“ Osiris, the scribe Ani.”

It now only remains to tell of the Ushab-
tin, or Answerers. They are little stamettes
of wood, stone, or porcelain, usually made in
the form of an Osiris mummy, for they were
to take the place of the deceased who at death
each became an Osiris. They were placed in
the tomb sometimes by the thousand, and
were required to answer instead of the de-
ceased, when Osiris demanded of the dead
certain agricultural tasks which he had a
right to require. Engraved on the ﬁgures
are formulae exhorting them to answer— “ 0!
ye answerersl If the monarch Phtahmosis is
called, is chosen, to do all the works that have
to be done in the other world, he who has
fought with his enemies, if he should have to
sow the ﬁelds, ﬁll the canals, and transport the
grain from east to west, like one whose duty
it is to do these things, then do ye exclaim,
‘ It is I, I am here,’ even if you should be
called at any hour of every day.”
