FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT 173

The sun was now overhead and its rays
grown ﬁerce. We beat a hasty retreat to our
cool little steamer by the river’s brink, won-
dering what could Egypt show more after
the marvels of architecture just seen.

In the early afternoon the Professor, who
is a perfect interrogation point, and who vis-
its every mission and hospital en route, eager
for data, invited Miss Shinn, B. and me to
accompany him to Miss Buchanan’s Mission
School for Girls, which he had hunted up the
night before.

Miss Martha is interested in missions; yet
when she sees the rabble crowd around her,
she turns away and exclaims, “ How dreadful
these peOple are! I am afraid of them! I
don’t want them to come near me! ” We
laugh and tell her these are her “ dear
heathen! ” One must honour the missionaries
who try to uplift these ignorant masses by
means of schools and by teaching them rules
of decency and cleanliness.

Just outside the city in an airy suburb we
found the Mission — a large stone building
with central court and sleeping accommoda-
tion on roof and balcony for warmer weather.
It has been erected scarcely two years.

Miss Buchanan, the principal, told us her
experience. She had come to Luxor six years
