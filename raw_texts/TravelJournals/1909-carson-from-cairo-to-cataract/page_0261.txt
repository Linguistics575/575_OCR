194 FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT

les in the Trojan War an image of him in
stone appeared at Thebes hailing his mother
Eos each dawn with plaintive cry. After the
overthrow of these monoliths by the earth-
quake of 27 B. c., Septimius Severus restored
them, adding ﬁve courses of stone to the
northern one, the more shattered of the two;
thereafter it emitted no sound.

A half hour’s ride farther brought us to the
extensive ruins of the temples of Medinet
Habu and the great Ramesseum. Heroic
Osiride ﬁgures of the renowned Pharaoh
stand twenty feet high in front of each col-
umn. Near by lie the huge head and shoul-
ders of the most colossal statue in all Egypt,
with the hieroglyphics of Ramses II graven
on arm and throne. The total height of the
Colossus is estimated to have been ﬁfty-seven
feet.

As we walked through the deserted courts
gray sparrows twittered and chattered and
peered saucily at us from every crevice and
cranny of the massive blocks. The dragoman
had frequently to stop and clap his hands to
silence the noisy chirping before he could
continue his explanations. After having writ-
ten you in detail of the greater Kamak, I
will spare you a description of these temples,
wonderful though they be.
