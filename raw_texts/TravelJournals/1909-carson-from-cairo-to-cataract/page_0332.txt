FROM CAIRO TO THE CATARACT 257

Kom Ombo, Denderah, and Philae, smaller
editions of the older shrines and excellently
preserved; their capitals more ornate, per-
haps, and their walls more elaborately dec-
orated with ﬁgures of gods and goddesses.

Although hers are the oldest, Egypt boasts
more temples and better preserved than either
Greece or ancient Rome. The untrained eye
rejoices in the completeness of those of Edfu
and Denderah. '

As I review the scenes just visited, each
stands out in memory, separate and apart, for
some peculiar beauty or individual charm.
For sepulchral art one should see Sakkarah,
and‘ penetrate the subterranean tomb of Thi,
Superintendent of Pyramids to a Pharaoh
of the Fifth Dynasty; most brilliantly
painted and delicately sculptured, it is ac-
counted the ﬁnest funeral vault in E gypt.
Or one may visit at Biban el-Muluk, the Val-
ley of the Tombs of the Kings, the still more
impressive mortuary chamber of Amenho-
tep III — his royal mummy deposited there
more than three thousand years ago, being
the only one allowed to rest in its original
tomb.

For picturesqueness and general effect the
beautiful shrine of Kom Ombo, in soft gray-
ish pink granite, standing high above the Nile
