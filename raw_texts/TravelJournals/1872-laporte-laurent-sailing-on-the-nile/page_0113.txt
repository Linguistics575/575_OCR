-108 SAILING ON THE NILE.

XIV.
NUBIAN GAMES.

THE ﬁery wind did not last; but the atmos-

phere ever since has been lifeless and
oppressive. Heavy, sad-looking clouds hang low
over the sky; the Nile ﬂows with a restless,
uneasy motion; all Nature looks dull and gray,
as if she had been drugged, and had fallen into a
stupor. Not a breath is stirring; and yet every
now and then a tremendous ﬂapping is heard
among the sails, as when a dying bird beats its '
wings. ‘

Timsah! Timsah! Mustapha, the pilot, has
just pointed out to us the ﬁrst crocodile we have
seen. There it lies outstretched on an island
near by, its tail coiled in tortuous folds. While-
we were gazing at the hideous beast, it got up
slowly, and began trailing along the sand; but,
startled by the sound of the craft, slipped back
into the water and disappeared.
