258 SAILING ON THE NILE.

The paintings at Beni—Hassan are an exception
to this rule. In them the conventional formality
and rigidity of the Egyptian style is less apparent,
less absolute: the ﬁgures are freer, more life-like
and expressive. It is evident that art is tending
in the direction of realism : it is studying nature,
and trying to cOpy it with ﬁdelity. There is an
elegance in the drawing, and an action in these
ﬁgures, which is wanting in the paintings and
sculptures that adorn the most magniﬁcent monu-
ments of Thebes. There are even some efforts
at perspective drawing. I noticed a row of oxen

taken in three quarters, and very happily ren- -

dered. ,

And yet these hypogeums, these paintings,
date back to a much earlier period-than the tombs
~ of Biban-el—Moluk or the oldest ruins of Thebes.

How was it that Egyptian art failed to carry
out all that it seemed to promise in starting?
What caused it to deviate from the true path?
Since the civilization of Egypt was the oldest of
all, the deve10pment of its art must have been
determined exclusively by the genius of the race :
unable to -borrow any thing from other nations,
it could not have been led astray by outside in-
ﬂuences.
