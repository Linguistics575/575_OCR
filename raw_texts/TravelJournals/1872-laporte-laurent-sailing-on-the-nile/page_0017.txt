12 SAILING ON THE NILE.

cotton plants, from whose half-Open pods ﬂew
ﬂakes of snow. Suddenly we all cried out with
one voice, “ The Pyramids!”

The ﬁrst ray of the rising sun had just struck
their summits, and in the midst of the misty
aureole of the morning they arose before us
white and shadowy as a vision. '

I have been promising myself, my dear friend,
not to trouble you with any talk about the Pyra-
mids. I have said to myself that the world was
full of descriptions already, supplied by a host of
travellers of the present day and of the past;
and, since, the Pyramids have been a theme of
discussion for more than forty centuries, that the
subject ought really to be worn out. .

Above all, I am in great fear of falling into
‘ commonplace; of being the mouth-piece of those
well-known, formidable sayings, those great truths,
—the nothingness of man, the shortness of life,
the equality of all before death, &c., — which
seem to keep watch about the Pyramids, and pour
down their inspiration in mighty waves upon the
head of every one who cOmes into the neighbor—
hood. The fact is that greatness, sublimity in
external objects; arouses great thoughts, which,
in their turn, require to be expressed in a grand
style.
