SAILING ON THE NILE. 257

“ The human ﬁgure in Egyptian paintings is
well deserving the closest study,” says Charles
Blane. “ Although details are overlooked, with
what boldness, precision, and even with what
delicacy it is drawn! The lines are severe and
grand; the attitudes are rigid and majestic; the
legs, for the most part, are parallel and joined;
the feet touch, or, if one is in advance of the
other, they move forward in the same direction,
and are exactly parallel ; the arms hang straight,
or are crossed upon the breast,'unless, indeed, they
are separated, that the hands may hold some
object, -—°a sceptre, the croizv ansata, or lotus-
ﬂower. But even this movement or rather situa-
tion, this gesture or rather sign, is merely the
representation of some solemn and cabalistic
pantomime. There is no life, no action: the pose
of the ﬁgure is predetermined, and you feel that
it will be permanent. There is no suggestion of
any change of position.

“ When several ﬁgures are represented, they
are arranged in parallel lines; and their limbs
move in unison, as if obeying some mysterious
rhythm regulated in the sanctuary. The surest
method of eXpression, indeed, which Egyptian
art employs, is repetition.”
