140 SAILING ON THE NILE.

mous heights, or lie scattered along the shore
like fallen avalanches. A few palm trees grow
among the rocks by the columns of a ruined
temple.

Buried in the depths of this silent, lonely re--
treat, this sacred adytum of Nature, calm in the
midst of the stern-browed, serried cliffs by which
she is so stormﬂy besieged, the island of Philae
seems forgotten and abandoned by the whole
world; and is so except by the sun and the
Nile. The Nile laves his favorite with soft
caresses, and murmurs tenderly as he lingers by
her shores. The sun casts down such a blaze of
glory upon her palaces and temples that they
glitter again : the old gray granite is transﬁgured
and seems a dazzling white.

Absorbed in a solemn, religious reverie, like
some faithful widow living in her memories of
the past, here for ever she abides, cherishing the
worship of former ages. With nothing save the
respect that is felt for her sanctity, the awe she in-
spires to protect from the profaning grasp of rude
hands, from the invasion of conquerors, she is
safe in her quiet seclusion; and in this calmness,
this silence enlivened only by the timid warbling
of birds, ﬁnds all her happiness.
