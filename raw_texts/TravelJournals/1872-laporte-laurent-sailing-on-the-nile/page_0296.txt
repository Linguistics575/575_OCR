SAILING ON THE NILE. 291

that you can summon up before you at will, or
whenever your imagination‘is kindled, you have
only to visit Egypt as the free and careless tourist.
_ Do as l have done, stroll along the sandy beach,
dream and meditate in the waving and majestic
palm-groves, take no note of the ﬂight of time, or
of how speedily or slowly you are advancing, but
ﬁnd your delight in the passing moment. Watch
the wind swelling the sail, hearken to the singing
of your crew, to the measured throbbing of their
oars; and, when night comes, cast your anchor
against a green bank or off a lonely shore, and
sleep in the Open air under the stars of heaven, ,
as did the shepherd kings. There is only one
way to see Egypt; and that is sailing on the
Nile,
