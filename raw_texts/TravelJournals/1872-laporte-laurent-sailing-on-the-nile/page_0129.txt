124 SAILING ON THE NILE.

The victims of this most prosaic shipwreck
next proceeded to hold a consultation with the
natives in their tent, when the following resolu-
tions were adopted. The Effendi was to provide
us with a boat, and, furnished with provisions for
two days, we were to proceed to Assouan. Dur-
ing our absence, Nicolo was to remain at our
hastily contrived camp, with suitable weapons and
an escort. The Eﬂ'endi agreed, also, to summon
men enough from the neighboring villages to draw
the craft out of the stream; and despatch a
courier to Assouan for workmen and carpenters,
so that it might be repaired.

This worthy ofﬁcial kept his word about the
boat, which soon came to hand. Ye gods! what
a boat, and what mariners! It was a good idea
naming it the bark of Charon. By all the ghosts
wandering on the gloomy shores of the Styx, I
pledge you my word that, if it had crossed back
and forth to the infernal regions a hundred times,
it could not have been blacker, more ﬁlthy, more
repulsive, more begrimed with smoke.

The face of the reis, bearded and horribly grin-
ning, recalled to my mind certain lines of Virgil,
which I had not thought of for a long time: ——

“ Portitus has horrendus sequas ct ﬂumina servat,
Terribile squalore Charon,” etc.
