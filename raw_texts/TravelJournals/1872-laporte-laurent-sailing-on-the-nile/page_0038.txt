SAILING ON THE NILE. 33

other animals which composed the Pantheon of
the ancient Egyptians.

Beyond the mountains lies the desert, sterile,
ﬁery. What is Egypt but a great oasis in the
midst of an immense desert? “ Sometimes,” says
Chateaubriand, “ there is a stealthy, treacherous
movement in the vast plain. It shoots forth long,
meandering streaks of sand, like golden serpents,
veining the fertile valley with desolation.”

As we advance, the capricious Nile winds about
in the most astonishing manner. Now narrow,
foaming, and of a turbid yellow color, then broad,
smooth, and as darkly blue as the sky, it seems by
turns a mere stream, a river, and a torrent. Some-
times it looks like an immense lake: its shores
seem. to meet, and the stranger with his unac- .
customed eye seeks in vain for the outlet.

At this season, when the river is low, the
numerous sand-banks are quite a feature of the
, landscape: with their white, glittering, evenly
rounded surfaces, they look as if they were warm-
ing their backs in the sun. These low islands
are a favorite resort with the crocodiles, who
like nothing so well as to sleep upon them'; while
as for ducks and other wading birds, they collect

about their edges by thousands.
