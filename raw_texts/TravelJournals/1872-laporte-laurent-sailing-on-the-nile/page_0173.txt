168 SAILING ON THE NILE.

.How pleasant it was to get back to our craft
again, to our saloon and terrace, after three such
days and nights as we had passed, full of delight-
_ ful experiences indeed, but of unexampled fatigue,
—three days of hunger and thirst endured under
a tr0pical sun in a country‘where shade is unknown,
three nights passed in the Open air with the stars and
the mosquitoes! Thoroughly repaired, cleansed,
and reﬁtted, the dahabieh looks gay, elegant, and
as shining as a new hat: we are delighted with
it. The crew nod approvingly with self-satisﬁed
smiles, aS'if every thing had been due to their
individual exertions; and the shore is lined with
friendly natives, who follow us with their good
wishes.

Here is the great hill of Kum-Ambos : we are
already at its foot, and send up a last greeting to
the grand old ruins that crown it, — sad and soli-
tary witnesses of our wreck. The Wind is fair:
the Nile, murmuring in harmony with the sing-
ing of the crew, bears us swiftly on ; and it really
seems as if we are going to have a pleasant and
Speedy voyage, and no more delays. Heaven
knows, it is time! We have had. trials enough.
.Wrecked on a gloomy shore, threatened . with
conﬂagration, and haunted by gloomy predictions
