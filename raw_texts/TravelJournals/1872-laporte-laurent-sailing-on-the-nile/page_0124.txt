THE CURSE on THE SANTON.

DID I ever tell you, my dear friend, of an

adventure that we met with soon after
starting? One day, by a bend of the river,
Abouset pointed out to us a little white cupola
peeping out from a pine grove. Here lived and
died a Santon, celebrated for his piety: it was
his last home. Here dwells his successor, and
summons into his presence travellers, reis, crews,
ﬁshermen; all, in short, who pass his shrine.
Seated upon a matting, he gives audience to the
faithful.

Oh! you, who shall hereafter pass this way, do
not forget, whoever you may be, to seek the pro-
tection of this all-powerful Santon. Dispenser of
good and evilfortunes, of chances and disasters,
upon him will depend the fate of your voyage.
Favorable or adverse as he decrees, even the—winds
obey his powerful mandate: it is his privilege to
impede the progress of crafts, or Speed them on
