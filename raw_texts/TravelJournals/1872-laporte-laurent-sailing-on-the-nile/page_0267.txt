dence which was followed by no revival, which
was the initiation of a fatal decay. Under the
Saites and Ptolemies, indeed, many grand monu-
ments were erected, thanks to the inﬂuence of
Greek art, which had now grown vigorous, and
returning to the land of its birth seemed destined
for a time to reinspire the sublime but tottering —
civilization, from which its own life was derived.
But, instead of accomplishing this, it only served
in reality to hasten its fall. Egyptian architect-
ure, it is true, preserved for some time longer
the severity of its forms and grandeur of its pro-
portions. Dendereh and Esneh were both built
after this period. But, notwithstanding, the spirit,
the very soul that had animated the art of the‘
early dynasties, was destroyed by coming into
contact with the genius of another peOple. It
gradually lost its distinctive characteristics: its
severity was softened, its traditions were for-
gotten, until the idols of the worship of Osiris
were ﬁnally overthrown; until the hieroglyphics
that had adorned its temples were eﬂ‘aced and
destroyed by the bigoted fury of the early Chris-
tians. The last temples of Athos and Osiris be-
came the ﬁrst Christian churches.
