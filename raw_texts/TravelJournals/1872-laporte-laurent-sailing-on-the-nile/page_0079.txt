74 SAILING ON THE NILE.

“ Before long we are waited out of sight of the
city, and these sounds die away. I can hear noth-
ing now but the soughing of the water under the
boat, and the shuddering of the sail as it is puffed
out by a gust of wind. The landscape is indis-
tinctly seen by the light of the moon. We ap-
proach the Arabian mountains, and then again
are swept away from them; and now suddenly,
with a tremendous shock, run forward upon a
sand-bank. The sailors jump into the water and
try to heave off the . boat; but all their efforts
are in vain, and, giving it up at last, they climb
back over the gunwales. We must put our
trust in Providence: our lodging for the night is
found.”
