196 SAILING ON THE NILE.

lous eXploit is related, which rendered him for
ever famous. Fallen into an ambuscade, he was
surrounded by two thousand ﬁve hundred of the
chariots of his enemies, each of them containing
three men, and covering the mountains and
valleys, says the poem, thick as locusts. In this
desperate strait, Ramses invoked his father,
Ammon. “ My archers and my cavalry have
abandoned me,” he cried: “ what is your purpose,
0 my father? Have I not celebrated the most
splendid feasts? Have I not sacriﬁced thirty thou-
sand oxen, with odoriferous herbs and the sweetest
perfumes ‘2 Have I not brought obelisks from
Elephantine, and erected in your honor eternal
monuments?” Ammon, in the high courts of
heaventheard his supplications, and renerved his
courage. Then Ramses, like the divine hawk,
rushed among his enemies, armed with irresistible
might. Three times he drove his chariot among
them, three times lay low their principal warriors,
and at last opened for himself a_ bloody road over
his slain foes, whose corpses lay scattered around
in one indiscriminate ﬁeld of slaughter.

This is the king who is said to have used lions
in his battles: he had tame lions, who followed
his chariot and'fought in his defence.
