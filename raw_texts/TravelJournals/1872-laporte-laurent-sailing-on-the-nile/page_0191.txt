186 ‘ SAILING ON THE NILE.

the city of wonders, whose pOpulation was as the
sands of the sea, whose caravans traversed the
deserts of Asia and of Africa, which received
tribute from all known quarters of the globe, and
reduced whole pe0ples to slavery, transplanting
them to its own shores. Where are the magniﬁ-
cent temples we have heard so much about? The
interminable avenues of sphinxes? The long trains
of priests bearing the sacred animals, sweeping
before you in solemn, silent processions? And
those granite palaces in which the Pharaohs wor-
shipped as gods, and claiming the attributes of gods
sat enthroned; upon whose walls was proudly
inscribed the history of their triumphs,— where
are they? Etiam periere ruine, —— “ Have even
the ruins themselves perished?”

' HOpe not to gain information by inquiring of
the shepherds you may chance to meet, for they
are ignorant even of the name of Thebes: even
the name itself has perished. Thev- monuments
of Sesostris and the Pharaohs have been rebap-
tized, and are known to-day only by the obscure
names given by the fellahs to their mud hovels.

On the western shore lie Gournah and Medinet-
Aboo: Opposite are Luqsor and Karnak. Where
is Thebes?
