236 , SAILING, ON THE NILE.

XXVIII.
THE smocco.

TILL the terrible sirocco is beating against
our windows, shrieking and wailing so la-
mentably that you imagine you are listening to
the cries of lost caravans perishing in the sands.
From my windows I can see the tormented trees
writhing and twisting; I can hear their branches
groaning and creaking; the birds have all dis-
appeared; and the frightened date-palms, with
their feathery crests high in the air, look like
umbrellas turned inside out.

The Nile is livid, and in as great a state of agi-
tation as a man burning in the delirium of fever.
Far more angry and turbid than the Rhine ever
becomes in the wildest storms, it fringes its
shores with a heard of foam, and keeps the da-
habieh rocking with a regularity that is perfectly
unendurable. You know how painful any an-
noyance of the kind becomes when long con-
tinued. '
