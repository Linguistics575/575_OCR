SAILING ON THE NILE. 49

what the rain cannot do, -— it fertilizes the
desert. .

The river begins to rise at about the summer
solstice: it increases in volume for a hundred
days, and then again, from October to February,
diminishes. It is now therefore at its lowest
point, and notwithstanding it is more than half-a.-
mile wide. '

An almost daily adventure with us now is run-
ning upon sand-banks. When this occurs, the sails
are spread, the crew jump into the water, the cap-
tain and mate arm themselves with poles, and all
set to work. It is curious to feel the keel slowly
uplifted by their laborious efforts; to hear their
stiﬂed cries and almost groans, as they put forth
all their strength to accomplish their task. When
the boat begins to move, they cheer and hurrah
lustily, and as it fairly ﬂoats oﬁ' leap merrily over
the gunwales.
