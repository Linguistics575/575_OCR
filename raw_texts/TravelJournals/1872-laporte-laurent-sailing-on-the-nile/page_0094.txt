SAILING ON THE NILE. 89

chevalier of the Legion of Honor, still by his side,
and followed by a numerous escort of horses and
janissaries.

Salutations and compliments concluded, we en-
tered upon the great subject of the day; and
the consul conﬁrmed the news brought by the
policeman. He had just attended the pacha to
his craft, and had seen him depart. He seemed ’
to think that order would soon be re-established,
probably in a week or two, and assured us that
we would run no risk in continuing our voyage.

Relieved on this score, we could think of more
cheerful matters. Nicolo passed round curagoa.
and coffee, and we took our seats at the table.

I must confess that Micaeli did himself more
than justice on this great occasion: his three
kinds Of sweetmeats were highly appreciated ;
and such was the vivacity of his champagne, that
a taste of it made us forget all about the rebellion.
We discussed the great interests of France, Egypt,
and Suez; we smoked our chibouks, sipped our
curagoa and coffee, became more enthusiastic and
Oriental than ever in our courtly, ﬂowery com-
pliments, and parted the best of friends. Our fat
bon-vivant was so taken up with his dinner that
he mercifully spared us his litany of oaths.
