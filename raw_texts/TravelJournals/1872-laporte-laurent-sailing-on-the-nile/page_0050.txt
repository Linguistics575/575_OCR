SAILING ON THE NILE. . 45

moment he caught sight of us, he sprang from
his rocky perch, and running down the rough
mountain side at headlong speed joined a brother
friar or confederate who was standing on the
shore. Jumping into the water, they swam vig—
orously towards our craft, hailed us on coming
within sight of it, and without more ado clam-
bered up on the deck.

Who these unexpected visitors were we could
not divine, nor did there seem any way of learn-
ing. Certainly we could: gain no clew from their
dress, since one wore nothing but a tahi (a sort
of little white cap), while the costume of the other
was even more primitive.

Our dragoman came to our assistance, and in-
formed us that they were beggar friars belonging
to the convent, and were in the habit of interrupt-
ing their meditations for the purpose of imploring
charity of Christian travellers. In conﬁrmation
of this report, the good brothers began crossing
themselves and intoning their petition, “ Buck-
‘sheesh, Christiani.” We gave them several pias-
tres; and, overwhelming us with OXpressions of
gratitude, they put the money into their pockets, —
I mean into their mouths,-—— jumped once more
into the Nile, and soon regained the shore.
