SAILING ON THE NILE. 181

XIX.
PHILJE.

ON G before dawn we bestrode our little
donkeys and ga110ped off towards the
island of Philae, which is above the cataract.
The region about Assouan is very desolate, and
bears traces of waste and devastation, that tell
the story of the vicissitudes to which, like all
frontier towns, it was exposed at an early period
of its history. We passed the ruins of Roman
Syene, and visited the crumbling fragments of the
old town, of which nothing is left but a portion
of the surrounding wall. What a singular sport
of fate ! The city has fallen, the bulwark remains
standing. Although the country is hilly and
broken, you can follow with your eye for a long
distance this massive granite wall, high - and
thick, and ﬂanked with broad and deep ’ditches :
so strongly constructed, indeed, that it has sur-
vived for ages the city which it was built to
defend.
