with a strong odor of sandal-wood. Meanwhile,
some picturesque-looking black slaves, dressed in
white tunics, passed around plates of bon-bons,
liqueurs, and Arabian pastry. Two old Arabian
women, weird and haggard, came in, and seated
themselves in the corner. The musicians tuned
up their instruments, and the Ghazeeyah made
their appearance.

This was the ﬁrst glimpse we had had of these
famous dancing girls; and we looked at them, of
course, with great curiosity. They promenaded
around the room, with slow, measured steps ; and
then one of them, who wore a sort of tunic of
changeable silk, embroidered with green ﬂowers,
and displaying perfectly the outlines of her ﬁgure,
came and sat down by my side. Her hair, which
was immensely long and heavy, was entwined
with strings of sequins, so arranged as to form a
sort of small sparkling helmet upon her forehead,
while falling over her shoulders like a Splendid,
sonorous mane. Tawdry necklaces of glass beads
and piastres glittered on her neck and breast;
and her waist was clasped with a broad silver
belt, from which depended little bells, which the
slightest movement was sufﬁcient to set ringing;
her arms and ankles were adorned with showy
bracelets, and her ﬁngers loaded with rings.
