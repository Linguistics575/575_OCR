complished their object, and, surrounded by a
dazzling court of sculptures and paintings, lay
down to rest in what they deemed an inviolable
sanctuary. Vain delusion! All their labor, their
foresight, their cunning, their miraculous achieve-

they so much desired. The ﬁrst modern travel-
lers who explored these tombs found that they

The tombs that ﬁll this valley of death were

slept “ the powerful among the strong,” they
who Spread terror among the living.

Among them is the tomb of Seti, the ﬁrst of
the shepherd kings who conquered Syria. Leav-
ing his new province garrisoned with Egyptian
troops, he attacked Nineveh and Babylon, subdued
Mesopotamia and Chaldea, carrying his victorious
arms as far as to Armenia. On returning to
Thebes, he constructed the palace of Gournah,
and the wonderful hypostal hall of Karnak.
