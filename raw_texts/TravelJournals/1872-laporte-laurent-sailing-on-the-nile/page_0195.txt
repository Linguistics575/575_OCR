Here it is that we ﬁnd the life of Ramses III.
recorded: his expeditions and exploits, his com-
bats by sea and land, are related in full upon the
stones of this priceless monument.

It is wonderful to gaze upon this hieroglyphic
volume of the past, even when its inner sense is
sealed to us; and I am sure that no one can truly
appreciate the achievements of men of science
who have wrested so many wonderful revelations
from these massive granite blocks, until he has
visited for himself the scene of their labors.
Among these great authors and investigators,
to none have I been more indebted, and none do
I recall with more satisfaction, than MM. Cham-
pollion, Lenormant, Ampere, and Mariotte, whose
profound works and wonderful discoveries have
been hailed with enthusiasm by all lovers of
science and of Egypt.
