THEBEs

HOW shall I describe my emotion when we

stepped at Thebes,— stepped with the in-
tention of remaining for several days, and visit—
ing its monuments?

There are certain places that every one has
read, heard, thought about, pondered over, ad-
mired, perhaps even has learned to love. So
much has been said and written about them that
they have become a part of the life of all minds.
We visit them in thought, imagine. how they look,
picture them under a thousand aSpects. Hence,
when we go to the actual places it is not as
strangers,—-—it is like returning to a sort of spirit-
home. . 1

“ my heart beat as it did when I beheld Rome
for the ﬁrst time: the two places, indeed, suggest
each other.”

How true this is, and how true it is of all
