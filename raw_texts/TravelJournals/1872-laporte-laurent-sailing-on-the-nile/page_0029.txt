24 _ SAILING ON THE NILE.

Towards evening we returned to our craft,
which awaited us at the anchorage of Gizeh. The
swollen, three-cornered sails were hoisted to the
wind; the tri-colored ﬂag ﬂuttered about with
French vivacity ; the domes and minarets of Cairo
faded away in the distance; the island of Rhoda,
with its N ilometer and its ﬂowering gardens,
gradually sank into the Nile; and our dahabieh
ﬂoated joyously towards Upper Egypt.
