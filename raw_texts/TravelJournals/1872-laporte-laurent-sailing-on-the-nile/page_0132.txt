SAILING ON THE NILE. 127

far from our eyelids on that unhappy night, leav-
ing us haunted by useless regrets that only in-
creased our torments.

And although it is true that we encountered an
army swarming over the benches of this fatal
craft, it was by no means composed of feeble,
helpless shadows: Enaeas would have found it
a difﬁcult matter to put them to ﬂight with the
edge of his sword. More numerous than the ﬂies
that hang over our tables at the hour of dinner ;
more numerous than the frogs that issued from
the river at the command of Moses, and invaded
the couch of Pharaoh; eager‘for carnage and
thirsty for blood, was the innumerable host of
microscOpic beings that Charon claimed for his
subjects. Under cover of the darkness, these
tiny, irreconcilable foes of man advanced against
us in compact, formidable tr00ps, and besieged us
on all sides. Stung, bitten, burning, itching, we
could not have suﬂ'ered more if we had been
robed in the fatal vest 0f N essus. Wretched that
we are, will the Santon never forego his ven-
geance.
