240 SAILING ON THE NILE.

brought to us to be cured: they always display
the most touching reliance in our ability to as-
suage all their ills. If faith still works miracles,
they ought certainly to be beneﬁted, by their own
conﬁdence, if not by our assistance.

But the case now before us was an exceptional
and aggravated one. This poor old man, trem-
bling like a dry leaf just ready to fall, was evi-
dently the victim of an incurable malady, and
beyond all human help. What could we do for
him? Nothing, of course; but it would not have
done to say so, for this would have deprived him of
his only solace,-—h0pe. We gave him a strength-
ening potion, which could not at all events injure
him, and at the same time made his son a present
of some rice. They went off quite contented,
.h0peful and joyful. The old man really seemed
to walk with a ﬁrmer step, and they turned re-
peatedly to eXpress by signs their gratitude and
good wishes. _

This reputation which we enjoy of being phy-
sicians has really at times burdened us with a
responsibility which we would far rather have
avoided. We have had the crew to look after of
course, and as they have met with no end of acci-
dents we have sometimes had our hands full.
