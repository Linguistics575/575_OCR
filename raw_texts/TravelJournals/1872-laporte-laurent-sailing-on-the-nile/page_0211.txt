206 SAILING ON THE NILE.

fragments of the magniﬁcent avenue of Sphinxes
which, in former ages, connected Luqsor and
Karnak.

Our guide, who was an old man with a long,
venerable beard, walked before us with slow,
measured steps : he had all the dignity and
gravity; — which belongs to the Orientals, and
harmonizes so well with their ﬂowing robes, —-
all that peculiar and almost epical solemnity of
deportment and propriety of gesture.

At one moment we stopped to examine a bean-
tiful triumphal arch at some distance in advance
of the temple; but the Arab turned, and we com-
prehended that we must follow him. There was
something strange and solemn in this silent walk
through the silent night: it seemed the initiation
into some grand mystery; it was like the prelude
to a symphony. '

Following our venerable guide, we walked on
for some distance to the left, and then again
turned to the right. Finally he stopped, and lift-
ing his hand with an authoritative gesture, like
that of Moses commanding the sea in the frescoes
of Flanders, Spoke.

“ We are in the midst of the temple of Karnak,”
he said: “ we are at the foot of the obelisks.”
