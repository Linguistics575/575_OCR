SAILING ON THE NILE. 91

XII.
ARTISTS AND THE ORIENT.

WE are approaching Thebes, and .since early

in the morning have been standing upon
the terrace with our'eyes fastened upon the south.
Impatient, speechless, we can remember nothing
but our eagerness to behold the city of a hundred
gates. _

At about noon, we caught our ﬁrst glimpse of
Luqsor.

It is really a solemn moment, that in which
you gaze for the ﬁrst time upon this vast tomb
of the past, —this broad plain, so silent and de-
serted, that lies outstretched before you on each
side of the Nile ; this ﬁeld of death covered with
temples, obelisks, colonnades, sphinxes, colossi,
—with so many grand ruins, motionless, majestic
in their venerable decay.

“ With mournful wrecks the mournful plain is strown : —
The palace overturned, the throne o’erthrown,
The broken sceptre, withered laurel crown.” 1
