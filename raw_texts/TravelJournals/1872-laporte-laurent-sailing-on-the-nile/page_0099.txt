94 SAILING ON THE NILE.

the shore when there was a change. The sun
dr0pped suddenly down behind the white tents of
a camp of Bedouins; and there we all were going
' into ecstasies over a wonderful group of cabins
lighted up by the Splendors of the west, glowing
under the crowned heads of golden palms, and
seeming to ﬂoat in a hollow vale of liquid ﬁre.
The whole scene, too, was reﬂected in the smooth
waters of the Nile.
“ That lovely plain, those hills that gleam,
A vision in the mirroring water seem!”

A dazzling vision of glory for a brief while:
the villageis now again nothing but a collection
of hideous, repulsive-looking mud hovels !

'Such is the magical effect of light! It trans-
ﬁgures whatever it touches : it beautiﬁes the most
horrible. ugliness, effaces defects and imperfec-
tions, and over all sorts of crudities and naked-
ness casts a veil. Fair Aurora, with her rosy
ﬁngers, clothes squalid. poverty with the most
marvellous hues; while the setting sun does not
disdain to transform rags and tatters into fringes
of gold. The whole earth is dazzled with his
splendor; and objects in reality hideous, seen in
the light of his smile, seem beautiful and en-
ticing.
