100 SAILING ON THE NILE.

exactly what they were in the time of Hagar and
Ishmael,— will be his theme. Indifferent and
impassioned, generous and avaricious, ﬁery in
courage, and a poltroon in cowardice; inviolabl y
faithful to his oath, and craftily cunning; pro-I
verbial alike for his h08pita1ity and his robberies,
— the Arab is the same in all ages. This singu-
liar individuality the painter will study and will
embody it in art.

Look at one of Fromentin’s pictures, and see
how he makes his steeds ﬂy through the air, shak-
ing their manes, and with their superb necks
haughtily arched. What ﬁre, what impetuosity,
what movement, in his fantastic designs!— bour-
nous whirl, guns wave; you hear hurrahs, shots;
pleasure becomes fury; the riders, standing in
their large stirrups, are drunk with air and space,
intoxicated with this wild race ; the horses, with '
their proud heads, smoking ﬂanks, ﬂying hoofs,
tails sweeping the ground, share their masters’
enthusiasm, and hear them on in a lightning
ga110p. What delirium! what fury ! what an
orgie of movement, —the clashing of arms, shouts,
tumult; the ﬂash of glaring colors, a whirling
chaos, a storm of dust,——and all seen in a limpid
atmosphere, bathed with the splendid colors of
the Orient!
