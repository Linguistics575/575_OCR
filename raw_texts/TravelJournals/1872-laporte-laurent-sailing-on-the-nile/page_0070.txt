night.

What is the sun of the North, with its pallid,
ineffectual rays, to one who has contemplated
this glorious southern star, the powerful Horus,
the fertilizer of the earth, and supreme God of
heaven, that Egypt adores? Our sun is lustreless
and lifeless, equally devoid of color and of
warmth in comparison. But perhaps we have all
that we deserve. In our day, when the gods are
dead, and 'when the goddesses no longer reign save
in the museums, when the smoke of progress has .
driven poetry from the face of the earth, why
should we eXpect that nature will reveal to us all
â€˜ her power and beauty? The heavens are right
to withhold their Splendors from peoples without
faith.
