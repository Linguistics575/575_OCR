SAILING ON THE NILE. 43

Even the villages themselves, so poor that there
is nothing in France that can give an idea of
them, are completely transformed when seen from
a distance, enve10ped in the warm, rich atmos-
phere of Egypt, or illumined by the splendors of
the setting sun. The mud hovels grouped under
the green aureole of the palm-trees, the outlines
of the pigeon-houses looking like the decorations
of some Opera scene, form a charming spectacle;
while every bend of the river reveals the most
exquisite scemr y. The light in the east works
miracles.
