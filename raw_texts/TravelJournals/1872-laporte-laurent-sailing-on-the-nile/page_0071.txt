66 'SAILING ON THE NILE.

VIII.
THE ARAB KIEF.

THE wind is fair, and we skim lightly before
it with all sails spread. Life on the Nile

is at once the most monotonous and varied, the
most idle and replete with activity, that can be
imagined. The changing pictures passing before
you are enough to beguile the delightful hours.
We mark when the gust of wind strikes the
shuddering sail ; note the rows of pelicans stand-
ing motionless on their long legs, the groups of
fellah'ines with their bare feet, the Mahometan
priest kneeling on the shore; and now we are
passing woods of date-palms that look loftier and
more graceful than ever; the shadoofs, too, are
more numerous; one of us has a lucky shot; a
craft ﬂies by, and yonder is a Bedouin camp I —
Such sights, such simple incidents, are our great
events, our important episodes; ﬁlling the mind
with imeges, and stirring the soul with emotion.

' These pictures, sensible images of a strange life '
