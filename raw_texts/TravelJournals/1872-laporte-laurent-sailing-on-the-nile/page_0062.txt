SAILING ON THE NILE. 57

Standing in the forward part of the boat, the cap-
tain thrusts every instant a long pike into the
water, and shouts in a hoarse voice to the pilot,
who answers him in a similar tone. Two sailors
hold the sheet, ready to let it go in case a too
violent gust should render it necessary.

Some two hours later the Arabian chain was
fading away in the distance. The Nile, freed from
obstructions, had grown broad and smooth, and
the wind was wafting us swiftly towards Asyoot.
