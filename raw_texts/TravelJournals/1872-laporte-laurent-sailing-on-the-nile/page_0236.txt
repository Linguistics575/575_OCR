SAILING ON THE NILE. 231

we talk of our cherished friends and relatives;
or, delving back into old times, recalling scenes
that we have not thought of for ages, summon
up before us half-forgotten incidents, half-forgotten
friends and comrades. In this country of the
past, this country of crumbling ruins, it would
seem as if one might be in danger of losing his in-
terest in the outside world; but just the contrary
is what occurs. Isolated, solitary, you are forced
back upon your own resources; and your affec-
tions, sentiments, all the interests that bind you
to life, the ties that attach you to others, assume
an importance which they never before possessed.
How many names, how many projects, which in
France we should perhaps have forgotten, have
become sacred to us in Egypt!
