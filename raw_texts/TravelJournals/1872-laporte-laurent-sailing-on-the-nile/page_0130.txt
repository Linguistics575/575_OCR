SAILING ON THE NILE. 125

A more accurate portrait of our captain could
not have been painted. With his rough white
oeard falling over his breast, his squalid garment
tied by a knot and hanging from the shoulders, he
was Charon in propria persona.

The prospect was not inviting, but unfortu-
nately we had no more freedom of choice than
the poor ghosts waiting to cross the Styx. Old
Charon hoisted a dilapidated sail, and, resigning
ourselves as we best could, we embarked with
Micaeli and two sailors.

The wind soon died away. Like a cloak of
darkness shrouding earth and sky, night dropped
down suddenly upon us; and, before being fairly
on our way, we found ourselves stupidly moored ,
on a black and muddy shore.

The Nile l—this is no longer the Nile, but a
marsh, and the most foggy, boggy, miry, fetid
marsh in existence, to boot. One would really
imagine it Virgil’s Stygia palus. Nor is this one
of the brilliant evenings cf the Orient whose
praises we have been chanting. The night is
suited to the place,—-a night of Erebus, dark,
damp, moonless, starless, the air thick with a
darkness that can be felt, huge masses of vapor
creeping slowly over the surface of the bog.
