136 SAILING ON THE NILE.

palms, the dom-palms, and the huge sycamores:
the stone capitals are wreathed and intertwined
with the green capitals of the trees. The island
of Philae is a fairy land of palaces and verdure.

Through the very heart of Egypt, from the
Mediterranean coast to Nubia, the Nile has wafted
us. I have climbed the pyramids of Gigeh, have
caught a glimpse of the wonderful monuments of
Thebes, but never have I seen any thing that im-
pressed me so deeply as this enchanting vision,
— this oasis of the past, rescued from the wreck
of ages, gracious and smiling under its green roof
of waving palms. Hitherto, Egypt has always
seemed to me powerful, colossal, formidable, but
dead, petriﬁed. In Philae, antiquity still lives; the
past is young, and seems to smile ; Pharaoh reigns,
and Isis is enthroned on high. The old worship
of Osiris, with its basalt gods and porphyry god-
desses, with its sacred scarabee and immutable
sphinxes, with all its attendant rites and mys-
teries, has withdrawn to this island, and here
still survives. It seems as if Time had not taken
a single step for thousands of years: his cruel
scythe, which spares neither persons nor monu-
ments, has respected this beautiful sanctuary of
the past.
