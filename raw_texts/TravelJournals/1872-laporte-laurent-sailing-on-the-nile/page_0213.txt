208 . SAILING ON THE NILE.

but only by the assaults of ages, which could not
be shattered save by tremendous convulsions,
upheavals of the earth itself, and which lie now
ﬂung together in that wild, fearful, picturesque
grace of chaos and disorder, the secret of which
is comprehended by Time alone, that sublime
artist, the great architect of ruins, -’— I gazed upon
them in a sort of stupor.

"' The rocks God made,” Victor Hugo writes :

“ man transforms them into the temple.” Yes,
but the fallen temple crumbles away, and is re-
transformed into the rock. Nature has far more
to do with ruins than man: her work it is, far
more than his, that gives them their picturesque
sublimity; above all, they are the work of God.
Respect them; for there is nothing grander than
death and decay. ‘

As I walked slowly through this forest of
columns upholding a granite sky, owls and huge
night-birds of all descriptions, startled at my
unaccustomed step, came whirring and whizzing
out of their holes and crevices in the rocks:
terriﬁed, they uttered sharp, shrill cries, and
ﬂew in mighty circles over my head. This was ,
the only sound. The heating of their wings, and

9 their discordant voices alone interrupted the si-
. lence, or troubled the. melancholy of the ruin.
