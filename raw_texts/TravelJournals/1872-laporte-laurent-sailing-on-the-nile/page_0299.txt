By the Author of “Happy Thoughts.”

MORE HAPPY THOUGHTS. '

By F. C. . BURNAND. One volume. Uniform with “_Happy
Thoughts.” Price $1.00.

“We want to read Mr. Burnand’s book when we are en rapport with
the author. If we are bothered in mind, or uncomfortable in feeling, we
can hardly appreciate justly the wit and humor of these happy thoughts;
but, if the mood is pleasant, we shall ﬁnd them diverting and laugh-pro-
voking beyond measure. Their wit is a peculiar wit, breaking out here
and there in little jets, and manifesting itself in unexpected spasms; and
their humor is something suggested rather than expressed: yet we cannot
help sympathizing with the genial spirit of the volume. In ex’rery page to
which we open, we ﬁnd some fancy or thought to entertain and delight us,
and something to touch our best nature; and we like the book, if it is not
as solid as a history or a treatise on science.”— Providence Journal.
