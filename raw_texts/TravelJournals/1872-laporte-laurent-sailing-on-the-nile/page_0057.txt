52 SAILING ON THE NILE.

these shady vaults, shut in from the outer world,
even from the sky itself, where all is harmony,
silence, mystery; the air heavy with a divine
blending of the twittering of birds, hovering
odors, sweet, penetrating exhalations, -'-— the soul
withdraws into her own kingdom and abandons
herself completely to the dominion of the imag.
ination. But not the imagination of the intellect
alone, fantastic, capricious, but to that born of
feeling, capricious too it may be, but kind and
irresistible; a powerful fairy, who knows neither
time nor space nor obstacles, who lives upon
memory, regret, hope.

Oh, who has not felt the charm of this good
genius? Who can resist her power, her attrac-
tions, when she sheds a light all around us, or
transports us into new worlds, purer, more beau-
tiful and brilliant than ours? when she lifts
slightly the veil of misery in which we go en-
shrouded in this valley of tears, and shows us, in
a brief gleam, some little corner of the ideal?
Who can describe the subli'meﬂvisions, the ravish-
- ing delights, theeffulgence of those blessed hours?
And is it not she who ennobles our dearest affec-
tion, our tenderest recollections? who speaks to
the soul in a mysterious language other than of
words and phrases?
