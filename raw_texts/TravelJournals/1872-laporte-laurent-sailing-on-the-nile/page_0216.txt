SAILING ON THE NILE. 211

a triple coating of brass, —if I should confess the
truth, it would have to be, I am afraid, a melan-
choly confession of weakness. The fact is, that
this ruin, the grandest in the world, seen at
this hour,’ lighted by this pale moon, produced
a most singular impression upon me. I felt
thrilled, — nay, more 1— completely overpowered,
by that strange sentiment which the ancients
used to call a secret horror. When mystery is
added to sublimity, how can we help being thrilled
and overaﬁved ? ~

It seemed to me that I was dreaming. All
that surrounded me was so extraordinary, so
colossal, so strange . and magniﬁcent ; there was.
such an unutterable serenity in the vague, dim,
dreamy moonlight; the whole atmOSphere was so
pervaded by some mysterious, solemn inﬂuence,
as if the spirit of the past were hovering there
on. outspread wings; there was such a strange
analogy between the objects that surrounded me,
which I knew to be real, which I could touch
with ‘my hand, and the imaginary creations of
the wildest dreams, —that my mind was ﬁlled
with the strangest hallucinations.

Are you such a visionary, my dear friend?
Have you ever had such an experience ?
