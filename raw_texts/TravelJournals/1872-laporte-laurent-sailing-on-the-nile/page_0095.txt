9O SAILING ON THE NILE.

Scarcely had our guests departed, when Abou-
set came on board from the shore, looking as pale
as a black man can: he was really in a great
fright. A craft which we had met near Girgeh
had not only been pillaged, but the travellers,
dragomen, and part of the 'crew, had been mas-
sacred: this was the information he brought.
The sailors were dumb with horror. We made
light of Abouset’s story, declaring that it must be
a false report, or at least exaggerated. And yet
when we remembered that only two days before
we had intended stopping at Girgeh for the sake
of visiting Abydos, and had only been prevented
from doing so by the lateness of the hour, we
could not help feeling a certain emotion.

The wind was fair. We hoisted our anchor,
and made sail towards Luqsor. It was now eleven
o’clock in the evening.
