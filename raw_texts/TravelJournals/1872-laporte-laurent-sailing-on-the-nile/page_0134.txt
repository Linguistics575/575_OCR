the smoking coursers of the sun have reached
their goal your gloomy bark conducts us in safety
to the roaring cataract, I will sacriﬁce to you
an old goat as black as Abouset, and as thin as
Micaeli.” .

Charon, indifferent to all our promises, sat
motionless at the helm of the boat.

that this odious old ferryman of the Styx wanted
to lay to again on some gloomy shore in the
realm of Pluto? Persuasions proving ineﬂ'ect-
ual, we had recourse to threats. This, it seems,
is the best way of dealing with these rogues
of infernal deities. This time, the old mariner,
who had never before seen a revolver, resigned
himself to tracking: he went ashore, seized the

rope and tugged us into Assouan.
