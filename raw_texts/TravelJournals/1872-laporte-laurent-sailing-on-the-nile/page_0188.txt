SAILING ON THE NILE. 183

great places! Thebes, Rome, Jerusalem,—-it is
unavoidable that they should be suggestive of each
other; for in .one thing they are all alike, ——their
pre-eminent grandeur and celebrity. Capitals of
the world, their glory belongs to all ages, their
name is known in all languages, their history.
is the inheritance of all pe0ples. A far greater
destiny is theirs than to have rendered a single
nation illustrious, or to be claimed by a single
pe0ple: shedding a light over all ages, and be-
longing to the whole world,—-for have not all
nations paid them the tribute of their reverence,
admiration, homage '3 — they are the pride and
glory of mankind.

Rome ruled the world for ages when debauch-
ery and despotism were seated upon her throne,
. and, having lost her temporal power, she' still _
reigns supreme in the name of charity and faith.

The holy city of Jerusalem will never cease to
sway the heart and imagination of all nations:
upon her calvary-throne sacriﬁce and martyrdom
will be for ever crowned. _

And Thebes? The monarch there enthroned
is the past. Thebes is the capital of ruins, of mag-
niﬁcent monuments shattered and overthrown, of
extinct civilizations, of lost religions. Thebes
is the city of tombs.
