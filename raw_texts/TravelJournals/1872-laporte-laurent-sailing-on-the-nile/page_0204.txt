SAILING ON THE NILE. 199

builders with enormous blocks of stone or piles
of sand. Entering, you pass in succession through
long corridors, broad galleries, long ﬂights of
stairs, and suites of rooms, all alike carved out
of the solid rock. The galleries are sometimes
horizontal, but very often are steeply inclined and
obstructed with wells, built, no doubt, to render
them dangerous, and bafﬂe curious explorers.
The rooms are of all shapes and sizes, large and
small, square and oblong; the roofs being sup-
ported by massive columns ornamented with cap-
itals of women’s heads. It is a world in itself,
mysterious and appalling,——- a kingdom of dark-
ness and silence, penetrating deep, deep into the
.heart of the mountain.

Multitudes of sculptures and paintings, mar-
vellous in color and most fantastical in design,
cover and completely conceal the walls of these
palaces of death. It really seems as if the old
Theban kings must have amused their idleness
by thus adorning their last abodes; granted the
privilege by the God of Tombs, who ought surely
to have had some compassion for the ennui of
his illustrious prisoners; or as if they had been
traced by the fantastic and capricious Spirits of
the mountain.
