SAILING ON THE NILE. 123

de'nce would do the rest. We did not .agree with
them, and greatly to their discomﬁture set them

This done, Micaeli went on an exploring expe-

quiries and get help from the police. It was all
in vain. Maﬁeb (there are none), —this was the
answer he received everywhere :‘he would have
stood as good a. chance out in the open sea. We
despatched the sailors in all directions. '

At last, about three o’clock, an Eﬂ'endi arrived
with quite a respectable escort of donkeys and
secretaries. He ordered some dates presented to
us, but Micaeli and N icolo were equal to the occa-
sion. Refusing the dates with contempt, they
broke out in what seemed to be a violent passion,
threatening and gesticulating in the most melo-
dramatic style. This is the only way to make
Arabs respect you. The Effendi apologized hum-
bly, stating, in excuse for his' own short-comings,
that he lived in a distant village, and on leaving
home had not known of the accident. To show
his sincerity, he ordered the Sheik of the nearest
village to be bastinadoed: the poor fellow’s soles
were already beginning to tingle, when we saved
him by our intercession.
