220 SAILING ON THE NILE.

a row of mutilated caryatides, I came at last to
the inner sanctuary guarded by two headless
pillars, adorned with has-reliefs representing
Thoutmés III., standing by the side of the God-
dess Athos, and ornamented with lotus-leaves
and other sculptures. This sanctuary, which is
comparatively small, is built entirely of rose-
colored granite, and is covered with sculptures
and paintings: here are displayed the colleges
of priests, sacriﬁces, battles, and all sorts of
allegories. ’

Beyond the sanctuary Open before you a new
series of courts, colonnades, chambers, and tem-
ples, all included in the grand temple of E Karnak.

The columns, capitals, and walls are orna-
mented without exception with innumerable sculp-
tures and bas-reliefs. Kings offering sacriﬁces to
solemn-looking gods holding the concoupha ﬂower
or the croix ansata, or to goddesses, coifed with
ostrich plumes, lotus-leaves, globes, serpents, and
birds, are among the most conSpicuous of the
scenes represented. We see also warriors stand-
ing in their chariots, shooting their arrows, be—
sieging citadels, driving over their ﬂying enemies,
crushing them under their conquering feet, leading
them back in chains, and returning in triumph .
