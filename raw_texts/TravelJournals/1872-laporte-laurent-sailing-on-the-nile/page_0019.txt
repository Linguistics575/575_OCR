14 .7 SAILING ON .THE NILE.

and indeed have built up their renown upon it;
.as, for example, their thoughts about liberty, the
shortness of life, &c. Every one is interested in
these subjects, they are constantly being talked
about; but genius alone has power to express them
worthily, to give the great idea an adequate
formula. When this is done, the generous senti-
ments, the noble thoughts belonging to all man-
kind, are incarnated, as it were, in a single verse
or period, and are henceforth identiﬁed with the
poet or orator who has thus made them immortal.
Speak of liberty, and you see before you Demos-
thenes attacking Philip; the name of Fénelon
suggests love, ——love alike to God and man ; nor
can you remember the shortness of life, the inevi-
tability of death, without recalling at the same
time Massillon and Bossuet. ‘

If I am afraid of these great sayings therefore,
it is not from a feeling of contempt, but quite the
reverse. I am too conscious of my own weakness
to forget our good La Fontaine’s excellent pre-
cept: “We must not force our talent.” I shall
endeavor to avoid them, for the same reason that
I should avoid choosing subjects that Raphael has
treated if I were a painter, from writing another
Athalie if I were a poet, or from imitating the ox
if I were a frog.
