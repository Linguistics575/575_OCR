SAILING ON THE NILE. 167

man exertions, violent geSticulations, fearful and
incessant shouts and cries, should ﬁnally succeed
in accomplishing a very little in a very great deal
of time. Before the craft had been brought over
to the opposite shore, loaded with its cargo, and
the furniture arranged ; before the process verbal
of the accident had been drawn up, corrected,
signed with all requisite ﬂourishes, and sealed,
—before all this had been accomplished, the day
had well-nigh slipped away. The sun had long
since crossed the Nile, and was nearing the west-
ern horizon, when ﬁnally the signal for departure
was given. ,

In preparation for descending the Nile, the da-
habieh had been dismantled, and was so changed
that we could scarcely recognize it. The main-
mast and great lateen sail had been stowed away
in the hold, and replaced by the small foresail.
The deck had been removed, and four great oars
eighteen feet in length were fastened on each side
of the boat. When all was in readiness, we sprang
aboard, and the sailors took their places each at
his post. And now there is one grand hurrah,
the anchor is drawn in, the crew strike up a
merry song of homeward bound, and dipping
their oars with a regular, measured sweep, we
dart off from the, shore.
