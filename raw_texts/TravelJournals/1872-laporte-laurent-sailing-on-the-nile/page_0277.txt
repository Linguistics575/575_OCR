272 ‘ SAILING ON THE NILE.

tion of ancient Egypt. Unlike the civilization of
modern EurOpe, it is incapable of growth, and
hence cannot be improved, cannot be perfected.
It is not a living tree, but a ﬁnished temple; and,
in spite of its apparent strength, is weak. Re-
move a single stone, and the whole building falls.
When ancient Egypt, becoming aware of its
weakness, tried to lean upon Greece, it was h0pe-
lcssly lost; and the intercourse now established
between modern Egypt and Eur0pe will have
precisely the same effect. The European cus-
toms and manners which the Pachas are endeav-
oring in the most stupid manner to incorporate
are so many daggers striking to ‘the heart of a
feeble organization already upon the point of
dissolving, -- an organization which has the cap-
ital defect of being an anachronism in the age in
which it is still allowed to exist. How long will
Europe overlook the enormities committed by this
government? How long allow this phantom of
the past to claim a place among living states?
I do not know; but the Pachas are perfectly well
aware that their last hour is approaching. They
are making the most of the feeble tenure of
power to which they know they can only cling,
while Europe is prevented from interfering with
them by its own internal dissensions.
