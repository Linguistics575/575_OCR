SAILING ON THE NILE. 15

It will not do, however, completely to ignore
the Pyramids under the pretext that the subject
is rather old. That would be a poor reason ; for
all things are’ both old and new. Whatever we
may say or write to the contrary, no subjects are
. really worn out. Material objects appear in new
relations, as man changes with the lapse of time:
even the Pyramids are a novelty to one who has
never seen them. Inﬁnitely various are the
manifestations of human intelligence; and, being
essentially imperfect, one may say that all that
we do has constantly to be done over again.
Originality is an intermittent, but an inexhaust-
ible fountain: even in subjects apparently the old-
est, those that have been the most often treated,
talked about to all eternity, there is always some
new point of view to be considered, some new
form to be observed, some new aSpect to be de-
scribed. The human mind is constantly renewing
itself like Nature. The forest trees will put forth
leaves, the ﬂowers will bloom to welcome the
coming spring. There is nothing older than the
spring, the green ﬁelds, and the ﬂowers; but _
neither is there any thing younger. And there
will always be birds and poets to sing about them;
for Nature is no less inexhaustible than the mind
