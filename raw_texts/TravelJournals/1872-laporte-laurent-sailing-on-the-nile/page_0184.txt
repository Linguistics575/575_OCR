SAILING OIV THE NILE. 179

’ of thirty-two columns, forming a sort of portico;
and ﬁnd in the vestibule beyond still other col-
umns distributed in .a similar manner. The
temple itself stands in majestic isolation, sur-
rounded by a grand-columned gallery, commu-
nicating on both sides with the portico of the
court. Like all Egyptian monuments, it is
profusely decorated with hieroglyphics and sculp-
tures in relief : these are in a good state of pres-
ervation, and I remarked with what accuracy
they had been proportioned to the compartments
they occupy. In the inner sanctuary into which
you pass, as usual, through a succession of painted
and sculptured halls and galleries, was one of the
grandest monoliths that I have yet seen,——an
enormous granite throne. The roof to which we
ascended is made of huge. blocks of limestone
ﬁve or six yards long, and lighted by small square
windows. The immense weight of the roofs of
these temples renders the massive and numer-
ous columns, which are such an essential feature
of Egyptian architecture, an absolute necessity.
When we entered the temple, some little Arab
boys persisted in following us. Pointing to a
crocodile painted upon the wall, one of them cried
out to me: “ Timsah, My lord Englishman.”
