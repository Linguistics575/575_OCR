56 SAILING ON THE NILE.

pursuing and crowding each other down, meet and
clash with the shock and uproar of contending
armies. Thus for ever they storm the impregna-
ble. fortresses, shutting them in on both sides.

The wind, engulfed in the narrow valley, takes
part in the mighty struggle; beating against the
rocks, it increases with its clamorous cries the
universal uproar. Now hiding her face and now
revealing it, the moon seems to run rapidly athwart
the clouds that overshadow the sky. You can see
the storm-birds whirling about in her rays, which,
when they touch the water, glitter like ﬁery ser-
pents. The rocky banks, full of black caverns,
assume the strangest, the most fantastic aSpects.
Colossal ﬁgures of Typhon you seem to see,
threatening you with hideous grimaces; or giants
crouching down upon the shore: the motion of
the boat and ﬁtful gleaming of the moonlight
make them look actually alive and moving.

Careening over, our dahabieh has a hard battle
to ﬁght with the impetuous torrent. Scarcely can
she force her way through the resisting waves:
on her sides they rear themselves up threaten-
ingly, and at her stern reunite with a shudder.
She is followed by a long wake of foam.

The mast is bent by the energy of the wind.
