SAILING ON THE NILE. 115'

dark blue sky, — reﬂect, meditate,—this spirit is
hovering over me : I look into the face of this
strange and radiant nature, I hear the voice of
this wonderful river, — all these marvellous
scenes that recall so vividly the' old Bible narra-
tives speak to and kindle my imagination.

If I had come here for the sake of science, I
should be to blame ; but since it was the sun
that drew me to Egypt, am I‘ not right? The
country of the fourth dynasty, or of the eighteenth
dynasty, would never have attracted me from my
course: the land where Joseph died, where Moses
was born,— this is the land that I have come to
visit. You can study at will in France, in Paris:
you can read ciphers and hieroglyphics in your
arm-chair. But if all this does not satisfy you,
if you want to see palm-trees, fellahines, the vil-
lages of the Nile, the luminous atmosphere of the
* East, the delightful scenes that we read about in
the Bible, —,this wonderful land, this sun, this
Egypt, in a word, with its present beauty and
past glory, —you must come and sail upon the Nile
as I am doing. Now that I am here, shall I not
enjoy it?
