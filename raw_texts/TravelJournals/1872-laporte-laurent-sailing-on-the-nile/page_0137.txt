132 . SAILING ON THE NILE.

From Syene, you can see both the Mussulman
cemetery, which contains several dilapidated
mosques towering up among its tombs, and the
ancient necrOpolis, thickly strewn with stately
monuments of granite and black, shining basalt.
One would suppose that armies of giants had
fought upon this plain, and left it covered with
their prodigious bones.

Your attention is attracted by two small
Mahometan tombs, standing on the brow of
- a hill, on your right hand, and built of some very
white stone. The precipitous cliiTs are covered
with immense hieroglyphics.

We turned to the left for the purpose of visiting
the ancient quarries of red granite, known as
Syenite granite. It was from these quarries that
the Egyptians obtained the stone for all their
monuments: .the columns, statues, sphinxes,
sarcOphagi, with which all Egypt is adorned.
Here stands an unﬁnished obelisk, with three of
its sides cut and polished, while the fourth is still
attached to the rock: there is a horizontal groove
in the rock, and a row of holes regularly pierced.
This is very interesting ; for it shows us how the
old Egyptians proceeded to rend oﬁ" these im-
mense blocks, many of them forty yards in length.
