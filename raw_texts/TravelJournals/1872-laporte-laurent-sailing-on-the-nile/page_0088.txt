childlike terror; and, on the other hand, it would

repulsive than the Ghazeeyahs, with their grimaces
and contortions, their silk robes, their jingling
pieces of money and gilded belts.

Tired alike of the dance and the dancers, we
invited the consular agent to dine with us on the
next day, and broke up the sitting. In the street
we found grooms holding saddled horses and
carrying torches, and with this brilliant escort
returned quickly to the dahabieh.
