grew intense; and this habit was at once healthy, and affords
every opportunity of enjoying the rich variety of cultivation

the habits of the population.

The hours of noon are those alone in which, even in summer,
there is any sense of oppressive heat ; the roof of the cabin is
then scorched, the atmosphere within is close and sultry, and
you long for the shadow of a tree on shore. As the evening
