a difference themselves admitted, all but the Reis himself, a man
of no religion, a practical inﬁdel, a Kaﬁr, as Salem indig-
nantly told him, who, instead of religiously working and not eat-
ing, would only eat and not work, ‘sleeping like a dog during
the greater part of the day. The rest, from the old steersman to
the last of the crew, never, to my knowledge, infringed in the
slightest instance the terrible rigour of this prohibition ; the
cravings of hunger they indeed contrived, in some measure, to
satisfy by taking their meals shortly before sun-rise, but, with
their beloved Nile at hand, not a drop of water passed their

“ May God receive you into Paradise,” are common expressions
interchanged between passing crews, and they never pass, even
at a distance, without saluting one another. The songs with
which they encourage one another at the labour of the oar are
in a similar strain of invocation, and often have a very beautiful
effect. The Reis leads the air, and the boatmen sing in chorus,
increasing the fervour of their chant and the vigour of their
