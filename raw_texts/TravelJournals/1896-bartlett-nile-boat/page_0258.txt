of silver in its midst, the Libyan suburb, its colossi, and
temples, the western mountain perforated with its countless
tombs, faintly relieving from the starlit sky, complete the awful
magniﬁcence of the picture.

After wandering about the ruins, our rides back across the
moonlit plain to Luxor were delightful. As we approached
the lights twinkled amidst its mud huts, and we caught, as we
passed, the sounds of boisterous merriment. During our visits to
Karnak the Reis and sailors, after the day’s fast, had spent their
time on shore between the dancing-girls and the raki bottle; to-
night they preferred to devote their reviving energies to a little
stealing. For the sake of privacy we had laid the boat along-
side an enclosed garden which came down to the river. Above
its low wall arose some date trees covered with the richest
clusters, which had attracted their cupidity from the moment of
our arrival. The proprietor, however, kept so close a watch
that to abstract them by daylight was wholly impossible. I was
- sitting in the little cabin, and reducing to order the sights of
the day, when I heard a loud outcry, and rushing on deck,
found the proprietor of the fruit, who furiously pointed to the
top of the mast, which one of the boatmen had ascended, and
down which he was gliding, encumbered with his luscious spoil.
The culprit was taken in the manner, and summary justice ad-
ministered on the spot, and, at my desire, by Salem, although,
notwithstanding his ardent piety, I could not somehow help
suspecting him also of being indirectly concerned in the theft.
