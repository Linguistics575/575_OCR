portionate to the wants and means of Egypt, hastily got
up by foreign rather than native energy, at the expense of the
heart’s blood of the country, which has been rapidly depopulat-
ing, and utterly draining of its vital resources, till the unhappy
population have sunk to the lowest depth of misery. To the
superﬁcial observer, Egypt may indeed appear to be about to
arise from her long depression, and to assume again a rank
among the nations; but the spasmodic effort can only result
in a profound exhaustion, unless, indeed, a far different and
humaner system were pursued. Perhaps Mehemet Ali may
be said rather to have destroyed than built up—destroyed,
that is, what remained of the old Mohammedan system, and,
by his numerous innovations, prepared the way for the con-
struction of a new. Tottering, as he is, on the verge of the
grave, he may die, perhaps, while these sheets are going
through the press ;' and then what is to be the issue of all his
ambitions schemes, and what is to be the fate of Egypt? These
are questions of which it may be imprudent to hazard just now
the solution. -

' The event has justiﬁed this anticipation—he died on the 2nd of August,
1849.
