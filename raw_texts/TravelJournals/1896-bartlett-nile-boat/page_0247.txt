caverns; others stand erect in towering grandeur, part perfect,
and elsewhere hurled as if by thunderbolts into chaotic confu-
sion. Beyond the main mass of the great temple, the heart of
ancient Thebes, others indistinctly appear, with the numerous
propylaea which gave access to them, and the avenues by which
they were united to the principal ediﬁce, receding on all hands
with an effect of bewildering grandeur. Add to this the out-
stretched lonely plain beyond, with its groves of palm inter-
sected by the river, and the distant mountains and temples and
countless tombs of the Libyan suburb on the opposite bank;
and some faint idea may, perhaps, be formed of this extra-
ordinary wilderness of ruin, and of the feeling of astonishment
it awakens in the mind of the spectator.

To attempt any detailed and minute description of this ir-
regular assemblage of sacred ediﬁces would be useless in a
work of this nature, which rather seeks to convey the impres-
sion occasioned by'a few of the more remarkable objects than
to enter into details ; ‘moreover, without a plan the most
elaborate description of this nature would be absolutely unin-
telligible. Even with the admirable survey of Wilkinson, with
which every one should be provided, lying before me as I write,
the plan appears so confused, that memory cannot retain more
than a few of its more salient points. This spot appears to have
been the most sacred in Thebes.‘ To the original temple, early
as Osirtesen II. , which was of small dimensions, additions were
continually made, till it assumed a vastness and splendour un-
equalled by any other monument in the city. Other temples
were erected in the vicinity of this most sacred site, and succes-
sively united, by avenues of sphynxes and majestic propylaaa and
courts, with the principal ediﬁce, till the whole formed a maze
of religious structures through which the ancient Egyptian
must have wandered with awe, and which, in their original
perfection, with the gorgeous ceremonial of the worship per-
formed in them, must have produced a soul-subduing effect
upon this superstitious peeple.
