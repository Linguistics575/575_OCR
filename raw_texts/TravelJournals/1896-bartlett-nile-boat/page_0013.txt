4 ms'ronlcu. INTRODUCTION.

Delta, and Joseph, as prime minister of the king of Mem-
phis, changed the laws of Lower Egypt. And it was after
Thebes and Memphis were united, when Joseph’s services
had been forgotten, that Moses led his countrymen out of
Egypt to escape the tyranny of their masters. The Egyptian
religion at this time was the worship of a crowd of gods, of
which some were stone statues, and others living animals;
and it was against these and other Egyptian superstitions
that many of the laws of Moses are pointedly directed.

The tombs of these kings are large rooms quarried into
the Libyan hills opposite to Thebes, with walls covered
with paintings still fresh, and with hieroglyphics which we
are attempting to read. The columns which upheld their
temples are the models from which the Greeks afterwards
copied. Their statues, though not graceful, are grand and
simple, free from false ornament, and often colossal. Their
wealth was proverbial with the neighbouring nations; and
the remaining monuments of their magniﬁcence prove
that Egypt was at this time a highly civilized country, to
which its neighbours looked up with wonder. The Jew-
ish nation was weak and struggling with difﬁculties before
the reign of David; the history of Greece begins with the
Trojan war; but before the time of David and the Trojan
war, the power and glory of Thebes had already passed
away. Upper Egypt sunk under the rising power of the
Delta. Theban prosperity had lasted for about five hun-
dred years.
