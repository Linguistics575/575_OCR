ARRIVAL A'r CAIRO. 45

Nile valley, lay upheaped ready for shipment, warehousing
being unnecessary in this dry soil and clime. An immense
number of barks, from the heavy Djerms, or cargo boats, to the
light and graceful Kangias for passengers, lined the alluvial
bank, or ﬂitted up and down the river. Into the midst of these
we thrust our pointed prow, got out our chattels, and, after
much angry uproar, got them loaded upon a camel; which
business being at length happily over, I mounted a donkey,
and galloped through the suburbs to Cairo.
