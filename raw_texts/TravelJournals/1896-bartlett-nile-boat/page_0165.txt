132 THE 81.st BOAT.

of some travellers of warm imaginations, who represent them as
purely sensual, and always anxious to attract a purchaser as
soon as possible. Whatever suffering they might have en-
dured in the circumstances of their original capture, they were
to all appearance taken very great care of. A fat, ﬂabby old
Turk now came waddling down from Girgeh, and the Abys-
sinians were produced and shown. They did not, however,
answer his expectations, in fact, I had myself seen far hand-
somer in the slave bazaar at Cairo, and he fell back upon the
negro girls. A group was now formed round one whom I had
not noticed before, and who presented in her reluctant, down-
cast manner, a singular contrast to the rest. Her dress con-
sisted merely of a string of leathern thongs around the loins,
but a large wrapper was throrm loosely over her. The J ellab
placed her, like a connoisseur, and proceeded to dwell upon
her ‘ points,’ but she did not somehow tell upon the sensual
fantasy of the old Turk, he was provoked by her air of dejec-
tion, and rudely thrust up her declining head; next, with a
cautious manipulation from head to foot, proceeded, in jockey
phrase, to ascertain her soundness; and, ﬁnally, hastily whip-
ping oﬁ' the scanty covering from the poor shrinking creature,
he proceeded to satisfy, with ,a hasty glance, the last and most
important particulars of his curiosity. The Jellab looked up
and smiled with an unanswerable air, but the old Turk looked
dubious and unsatisﬁed, the crowd of callous and laughing spec-
tators were, as usual, divided in opinion, while the defenceless
subject of their gaze and controversy stood cowering before
them with an air of abject, hopeless despondency. One might
see that, although of a race supposed to be comparatively desti-
tute of feeling, nature had made her of a mould too ﬁne for
such rude handling; perhaps some home remembrance came
across her mind, for a more melancholy expression I never wit-
nessed in a human creature. Finally, the old Turk declined to
purchase her, and she walked listlessly back again to her corner
in the hold of the Djerm.
