14 A GLANCE A'r MALTA.

and with little vegetation, but that little consisting of orange
trees, broad-leaved bananas, and patches of brilliant scarlet ge-
raniums. On the quays, swarms of babbling lazzaroni mingling
with sturdy seamen, on the cool ﬂat roofs, groups of ladies
wrapped from head to foot in their black silk mantillas, the
noble harbour studded with men of war and steamers, the
crowd of white-sailed feluccas, and gaily painted and draperied
boats—present altogether a spectacle as novel and peculiar as
it is brilliant.

Strange and foreign looking, however, as the place appears
at ﬁrst, you have but to land to seem half at home. English
soldiers in their familiar costume and erect disciplined bearing,
and shops set out on the English model, might make you forget
your distance from it; but images of saints, and shrines, and
priestly processions, followed by a crowd of bare-footed lazza-
roni, soon restore the original impression,—while amid the
“thunder of ten thousand tuneless bells,” you ascend, jostled
by a throng of importunate beggars, “ those cursed streets of
stairs,” as Byron calls them, which lead up into the prin-

twenty-four hours allowed for our brief sojourn had however

promenade above Valetta I cast a parting look over the splendid
panorama. There was our well-appointed vessel, getting up
her steam, surrounded by a crowd of others, attracted to this
central point, where the different lines of steamers employed in
the transmission of correspondence do meet and congregate.
Far different was the scene in this respect when I last traced
the same route: instead of the prompt, rapid, and almost luxuri-
ous conveyance which these afford, whatever he the port de-
sired, I_had then to wait three tedious weeks for the privilege of
sailing in an old dirty Maltese brig. Fifteen days of suffering
were then passed in the voyage to Egypt; the vessel was un-
speakably ﬁlthy, swarming with rats, cock-roaches, and other
vermin, and when after a prostration of several days by sickness
