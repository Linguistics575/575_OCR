pearance at a little distance, for they will rarely bear close
inspection, of the lower class of the females; untrammelled
by tight garments of any sort, their costume consisting of a long
loose blue robe, their hands and feet being uncovered, the
wrists and ancles adorned with bracelets, their gait is easy and
noble, and the necessity of bearing their water jars on their
heads, or their naked children on their shOulders, causes them
to assume an erect position, and gives them their full stature.
Their mud-built hovels, which the ﬁrst storm destroys, in the
midst of heaps of ﬁlth and oﬁ‘al, are the favourite resort of troops
of those half-savage and masterless curs, that ﬁercely assail any
one who attempts to penetrate into their quarter. Childhood,
which, among the poorer class in other countries, often ﬂour-
ishes in the midst of poverty and squalor, in its happy buoy-
ancy, here seems the most wretched period of existence;
the meagre listless infants, covered with dirt and ﬂies, which
form a black ring around their apparently weak diseased eyes,
present a distressing spectacle. Yet, with all the hardships
and oppression they suffer, the Arabs, even of the lowest class,
are a most immeasurably noisy, lively, mercurial people. Their
woes sit more lightly on them than on our own overworked
and degraded poor, whom nothing but the gin shop can arouse;
for one can hardly go out into the open spaces of the suburbs
without falling in with groups, assembled round some musician
or story-teller, ﬁlling their imaginations with all the wonders
of oriental romance, into which they can retreat from the
wretchedness of their real present condition.

Passing through these mingled currents of Eastern and
Western life, I had an excellent view of the remarkable man,
at whose bidding they have poured into Alexandria, and given
to her a phoenix-like prosperity. He rode slowly by on horse-
back; I was struck with his bearing, and with the searching
glance of his quick grey eyes. His appearance is digniﬁed,
and very different from that of the late Ibrahim, his son, whose
traits were wholly coarse and unreﬁned.
