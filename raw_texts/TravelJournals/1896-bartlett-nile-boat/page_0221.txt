the gods of Thebes; every detail of their splendid religious cere-
monies seems elaborately depicted; while on the other wall he
is represented as battling and triumphing. Seated proudly in his
car, he receives the unhappy captives, whose arms are painfully
bound behind them; scribes enumerate the hands of the slain,
and even more disgusting memorials of the barbarity of oriental
warfare, which are heaped up before him; and the history of
these exploits, supposed to record victories over their Asiatic
enemies, appears in the accompanying hieroglyphic tablets.
Passing to the outside of the temple, the same scenes are exhi-

gigantic scale, is conspicuously exhibited—terrible and even
cruel to his enemies, he is devoted to his protecting gods; he
transfixes the lions who attack his car with the same intrepidity
and success with which he drives upon the opposing hosts,——in
short, he is the very ideal of an old Homeric warrior and king.
I have only instanced the principal objects of interest at Me-
deenet Habou, and those very brieﬂy. Pass we now from this
great and confused assemblage of buildings, along the edge of
the cultivated land towards the ruins of the Memnonium. This
track displays on all sides vestiges of former buildings, tombs
on the sandy slopes and hills, and remains of statues and tem-
ples in the marsh below, connected with the colossal statues of
