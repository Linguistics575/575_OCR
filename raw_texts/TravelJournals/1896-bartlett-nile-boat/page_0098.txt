Astracan, Carizme, Delhi, Ispahan, Bagdad, Aleppo, Damascus,
Smyrna, and a thousand other cities were sacked or burnt, or
utterly destroyed, but the timely submission of the Egyptian
sultan, together with Timour’s experience of the military
prowess of the Memlooks and their leader, averted from Cairo
the fearful visitation which had befallen so many other famous
cities.”

To complete this brief sketch of the architecture of Cairo,
I proceed to give a general description of the style of building
adopted in private dwellings. Coolness, together with that
seclusion required by the domestic habits of the Orientals, are the
principal points which have been studied in all their arrange-
ments. The foundation-walls are of stone, and the super-
structure of brick; the lower windows in those facing the
streets are above the line of vision, even of persons on horse-
back ; the windows of the upper stories project into the street,
and are carried out and cased externally by wooden lattice
work, sufﬁciently open to admit the air and light, which comes
thus softly veiled into the interior, enabling those within to
obtain a view into the street without, while they are themselves
entirely concealed from the closest scrutiny of passengers, or
even opposite neighbours. In addition, these windows are
generally shaded by a projecting cornice of carved wood-work,
casting deep shadows over the front, of graceful and ornamental
patterns, as may be seen in the different views. In the narrower
streets these nearly or quite met, but in new houses they are
being gradually lessened, while the rich and raised carving is
giving place to glass and lattice of a simpler character, so that
by degrees the picturesque aspect of the streets will be much
impaired. A winding passage usually leads through the
ornamented doorway into a court, into which the apartments
look, with doors conducting to the harem—the upper apart-
ments, exclusively occupied by the women and children, with
the master. In the court is generally “ a well of slightly
brackish water, which ﬁlters through the soil from the Nile ; and
