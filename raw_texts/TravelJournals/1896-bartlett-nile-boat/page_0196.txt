seem likely to stand, to tell their tale to those who will here-
after call us the ancients.

It is well to remind the reader that my promise was but to
“ glance” at Thebes, to give a general impression of the site,
and a few views of the most remarkable monuments, in fact,
rather to excite than satisfy an interest in the subject. To
describe the buildings in detail would be an endless task; such
descriptions, besides, would be equally uninteresting and unin-
telligible without a far more numerous collection of views than
can be given here; and still the tombs, perhaps the most won-
derful objects, and the most interesting in a historical and anti-
quarian point of view, must ever remain without adequate illus-
tration. In fact, nothing but a most elaborate series of copies of
the sculptures and paintings they contain, which would alone ﬁll
volumes, could give to the reader any idea of them; and to
describe them in detail would be no less than to describe the
religion, manners, and customs of ancient Egypt. The results
of long and persevering study of these authentic memorials of
the past, assisted by learning and genius, may be seen in the
work of Sir Gardner Wilkinson on this subject; there a vast
number of details, which the traveller sees but in succession,
without any clue to their connexion, have been reduced to
order, and illustrated by comparison with history, which in its
turn has received a new light; and thus, in these invaluable
volumes, all the splendour of ancient Egypt and of Thebes is
brought up most vividly before us,—the pride, pomp, and cir—
cumstance of the old warrior kings, the splendid ceremonial of
the worship that once ﬁlled these vacant temples, and the luxury
of the private dwellings, of which not a trace now remains.
Through his erudite researches, the strange gods and goddesses
of the Egyptian mythology, which every where meet our gaze on
the walls of these temples, are no longer regarded merely as ob-
jects of the idolatry of the vulgar, but assume a symbolical mean-
ing, as embodied attributes of the universal cause; as they did
