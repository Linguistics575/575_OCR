heart of the mountain. I did not measure these avenues, but
am sure that several of them are nearly half a mile in length by
ﬁfty or sixty feet wide and eighty deep. Many large masses
remain as they are left by the workmen, and all the processes of
quarrying are plainly exhibited.” These excavations form a
perfect labyrinth, and are supposed by Dr. Olin to have given
shelter to the persecuted Christians, from the crosses that are
painted in different places. Some idea of the peculiarities of
this remarkable spot, of its perforated grottos, decorated with
the achievements of the ancient kings, its fantastic rocks, one
of which, from its resemblance to a rude pillar, is supposed to
have originated the idea of a chain being thrown across from it
to the opposite side, together with the immense scale of the ex-
