been removed, but portions of the drapery at the side of the
face remain. Should any one imagine that the annexed re-
presentation exaggerates the size, it may be stated that the
circumference of the head around the. forehead is given by
Pliny as one hundred and two feet. It is supposed to have
been originated by Thotmes III., and the names of his son and
of later monarchs are inscribed upon it, and they; are repre-
sented as offering sacriﬁce to a smaller representation of it.

From contemplating this marvel of the ancient world, we
repaired to our nocturnal abode in a tomb scooped out of a
ledge of the rock on which the great pyramid is reared. Hav-
ing arranged with certain Arabs to wake us up in order to
ascend it before sun-rise, we lay down, supped, and slept

Beautiful is the dawn in every land; but in Egypt

too soon exchanged for the glare and heat of the long
summer’s day. The Arabs awoke us from our slumbers in
the tomb, and in a few moments we were at the base of
the great pyramid. .

As in the case of the Falls of Niagara, so it is with these
marvels of human creation, it is not until you stand close be-
neath them that you realize their stupendous magnitude and
almost overwhelming grandeur. In looking up at these count-
less layers of masonry, each of them more than breast high,
which tower upwards to the dizzy apex, imagination readily
exaggerates the difﬁculty of their ascent; but to the Arabs the
feat is as familiar as going up-stairs, and their fearlessness and
dexterity are sufﬁcient to assure the most timorous. It is at the
north-east corner that we began the ascent, where time and
accident have somewhat wrought the massive stonework into
cracks and ﬁssures; of these the Fellahs know every one, and
seizing our hands, they rapidly hauled us upwards, instructing
us in every foot-hole; and shouting, laughing, One pulling us
