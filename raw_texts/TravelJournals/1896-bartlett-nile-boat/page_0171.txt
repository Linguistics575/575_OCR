is doubled. It will be seen that the machine consists of two
pillars of wood with a horizontal bar across, and levers formed
by a branch of a tree, having at one end a heavy weight com-
posed of mud, and at the other a vessel of leather or basket-
work, which is made to descend into the river, and hoisted by
the assistance of the weight to the level of the land above, then
poured into a trough hollowed out, from which it is distributed
in channels about the surface of the land. When the water of
the river is low, four or ﬁve of these machines are required to
raise the water to the necessary level. Few occupations can be
more laborious than working the Shadoof, it is, in fact, the
heavieat duty of the Egyptian peasant. Its use, according to
Wilkinson, is as ancient as the time of Osirtesen I., the sup-

and the principal sustenance of the lower classes, but its trunk

rigging and other purposes. Almost every thing for ordinary
use in Egypt is made of the clay of the "Nile, or the palm tree.
The Dom or Thebaid palm is 'also very picturesque, with its
singular radiating groups of fan-like branches, and its thick
clusters of dark, ﬁg-like fruit. It is peculiar to Upper Egypt,
and I have seen one or two near the site of Ezion Geber,
at the head of the (Elanitic branch of the Red Sea. The
density of the palm groves varies with the richness of the soil,
and some places are noted for the peculiar excellence of the
fruit. At one of these, while descending the river, my servant
requested permission to go on shore and purchase a quantity
to take to Cairo. On returning to the boat, he hung up in my
cabin one of the most magniﬁcent clusters ever seen, the ﬂavour
