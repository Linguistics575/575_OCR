valley of death, which gathering and reﬂecting his ﬁery rays, is,
at noon, all but insnnportable. A steep pathway, up which we
toiled with difﬁculty on foot, gradually brought us toward the
summit of the mountain, and we looked down into the chasms
sunk 'below, in the very depth of which are descried, here and
there, the narrow .darlr mouths of the sepuldhres, while others,
undisturbed, are hidden in .nnseen recesses. Arriving at the
crest of the passage, .a light breeze from the Nile ”fanned
our aching brows and somewhat relieved the oppressive sultri-
ness, and the eye caught suddenly on the broad and noble river
rolling afar like .emolten and glittering silver. A «few steps more
brought us to the very edge of the precipice, and «the site of
the “ world’s great mistress on .the Egyptian plain ” lay out-
stretched before :us [under the :noontide heat.

It is, indeed, marked by nature for a great capital ;—.a
grand valley many miles in width, divided by the Nile—de-
fended on the west by . the crow range of mountains we
stood upon, and .on the east by the far distant hills on the
Arabian side';—a mighty area, strewn for miles with the
scattered remains of farmer magniﬁcence, which, colossal as
they ,prove to be on a nearer approach, from hence appear but
specks upon the lifeless, desolate expanse.

.I have not exhibited in the drawing the entire extent of the
view, the Assaseef and its region of tombs lying too far to the
west to be well included. The noble river, though the :city
through which it ﬂowed :has passed away, still maintains its
fertilizing inﬂuence; its annual deposit, like its bed, has risen
higher, and the ground probably once occupied 'by buildings
in the-centre of the view is all cultivable up to theedge of the
sand at the footof the Libyan'mountains. The bold:oﬂ'—shodts of
the aridsandstone mountain which occupy the .fore and middle
ground are pierced withinnnmerable sepulohres, running deep
into the heart of the .rock, the greater part -of which “face the
south; the valleys between are equally the abodes of death,
mummy-pits, .long opened and rifled, every where honeycomb
