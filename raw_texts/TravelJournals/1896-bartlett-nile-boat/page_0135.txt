arose in the course of centuries, the materials of Memphis
were taken to erect them: and thus, although it subsisted a
great and ﬂourishing city long after Thebes had sunk to a
cluster of villages, the temples of the latter city still stand to

annoyance of the Arabs, whose petty, but insatiable desire
for beckshisb, which leads them to dog your every footstep for
a chance of employment on which to found some claim, griev-
ously disturbs you on an occasion when silence no less than
