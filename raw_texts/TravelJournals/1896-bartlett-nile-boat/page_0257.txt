the Great Hall. Here the genius of Egyptian sculpture appears
to have reached its height, and to approach the high character
of Grecian art, and we admire no less the fertility of invention,
masterly execution, and expression which animates the several
groups, than we follow out with interest all the incidents of
the different wars and triumphs of the Egyptian monarchs, so
vividly represented, the scene of which Wilkinson supposes to

pathway; some in deep shade with their edges only illuminated,
others basking in the whitening beams, with their hieroglyphics
and paintings almost as vivid as by day. Enormous heaps of
ruin, distant gateway towers marking the avenues of approach,
expand mysteriously beyond the reach of vision; whilst the
plain, with its green crops and palm groves, the Nile, like a bar
