sails, we could not breast its fury, but were evidently backing
into a whirlpool edged with jagged rock splinters—an ominous
predicament. It was now, at the decisive moment, that all but
those required for the helm dashed into the ﬂood, and with a
long pull, and a strong pull, and a ‘ Heylessa ” chorus, in-
creasing in vigour and desperation with the obstacle to be sur-
mounted, we shot up the rapid into the quiet water above, and
the rocks around echoed with the shouts and laughter of the
naked and streaming Nubians, like so many animated statues
formed out of the black basalt crags around. A calm and noble
reach of the majestic river, shut in like a lake with its mountain
border, soon opened on us through a portal of the last of those
scattered piles of sombre rocks through which we had forced
our noisy way; and in its midst an island slept, as it were, in
enchantment—the sacred Philaa; its temples of mysterious
sanctity half-hidden by sheltering groves of palm, and reﬂected
far down into the broad, silent, and glassy river. Gliding across
this tranquil bason, we furled our sails and laid the boat under
the deep cool shadow of a high bank overhung with foliage;
certainly the most beautiful spot in Egypt. A graceful co-
lumnar building, of the later style of Egyptian art, on a bold
and massive foundation, looked down, from amidst clusters of
palms, upon the water—one of those combinations rather like
the creation of a painter’s fancy than an actual scene.

The entire scenery from Assouan to Philae is so utterly un-
like the general character of the Nile, and so impressed with an
almost unearthly wildness—fantastic and impish, as Miss Mar-
tineau well calls it—the frame-work in which is often set a“
beauty almost as unearthly, that no region could have been so
well selected by the ancient Egyptians to invest with the most
sacred scenes of their mythology. Philm itself was a spot of
peculiar sanctity, as one of the fabled burial-places of Osiris.
“ So holy was the place,” says Wilkinson, “ that no one was per-
mitted to visit it without express permission; and it was fancied

' “ God help us! "
