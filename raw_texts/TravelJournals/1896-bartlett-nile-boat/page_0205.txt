164 HALL or BEAUTY.

this apartment are every where covered. Its scale indeed, after
the vague language of some writers, may a little disappoint
the traveller, who has perhaps looked for a boundless “ hall
of Eblis ” in the interior of these sepulchres; but nothing
can be more.wonderful than to see, as the light of the torch
is applied successively to the dusky walls, group after group,
of the most elaborate execution _ and vivid colouring, start suc-

case; a staircase at the nearest end of the inner wall conducts
to two passages, and another chamber, into the great hall, which
is rather larger than the one ﬁrst entered, and having six pillars
instead of four, with two lateral apartments, and at the extremity
an oblong covered saloon, in the midst of which, on the summit
of an inclined plane and staircases, extending deep into the
