every dance. They had once been handsome, but were now,
though young, decidedly usé, worn out with early proﬂigacy,
and bedaubed, ‘ ad nauseam,’ with a thick layer of vermilion.
Their dress consisted of very large loose trowsers of silk, and a
tight-bodied vest open at the bosom, and having long sleeves,
with a large shawl wreathed round and supporting their lan-
guid ﬁgures; they were also profusely decorated with gold
coins and bracelets. When I ascended to my post of honour,
or rather humiliation, they were merely ﬁguring in lazy and
somewhat graceful attitudes around the platform, clicking their
castanets, and exchanging speaking glances with the hoary
sinners around; but on my seating myself, one of them saluted
me with a ‘ pas ’ of such an equally original and unequivocal
character, as elicited a burst of laughter and applause from old
and young, brought the blood into my cheeks, and made me
wish myself any where else than where I was. The dance then
began; but I am not going, like some travellers, to give, what
Byron calls, “ a chaste description ” of it; sufﬁce it to say, that
at ﬁrst modestly coquettish, it became by degrees the excitement
of wanton phrenzy, and at length died away in languor. The
points of more salient expression were warmly applauded, both
by old and young; none were here ashamed openly to evince,
what it is considered more decent to veil, in our own reﬁned
community, where the accomplished art of the opera ﬁgu-
rante is skilled in throwing a still more dangerous charm
of mingled grace and piquancy over the same idea, which,
in all its unveiled grossness, forms the characteristic expres-
sion of the Egyptian dance. I was not, of course, at all sur-
prised at this; but I had expected, from the descriptions of
former travellers, (which I cannot help suspecting of exaggera-
tion,) far greater elegance in the movements of the dancers;
perhaps these might not have been among the most accom-
plished specimens of the sisterhood. I was glad enough for
once to have witnessed the exhibition, but still more content
to escape from my post of dishonourable pre-eminence.
