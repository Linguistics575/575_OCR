city but one solitary obelisk, about sixty-two feet high, seen
from afar rising above a grove of date and acacia trees.
It bears the name of Osirtesen I., with whom Joseph is
supposed to have been contemporary; and it is thus one of
the most ancient monuments in Egypt. The base is buried
several feet in the earth that has gradually accumulated after
the inundation, which now enters the area, described as formerly
overlooking the surrounding level. Osirtesen I. is the ﬁrst
great name in Theban history; he reigned over Upper and
Lower Egypt. He was the builder of the older and smaller
part of the great temple of Karnak. It was most probably
at Heliopolis that Moses acquired the wisdom of the Egyp-
tians, and where he planned the liberation of his countrymen.
Here too, or in the vicinity, Jeremiah wrote his Lamentations
for their downfal. From the learned priests of Heliopolis
Plato, who studied here several years, is believed to have
derived the doctrine of the immortality of the soul, and of a

future state of rewards and punishments. It has been mentioned
in the description of Alexandria, that the seat of learning was
transferred hence to that city, and that the obelisks of Cleopatra
(so called) once ornamented the fallen city of Heliopolis.
