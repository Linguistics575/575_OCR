To add another book on Egypt to the number that have already
appeared, may almost appear like a piece of presumption. But it

principal monuments of the earlier or Pharaonic monuments, as at
Thebes; the later Ptolemaic style, as at Edfou and Philm; with some
of the most beautiful specimens of the Arabian, at Cairo. The sites
of Alexandria and Thebes, with their principal ruins, are, it is hoped, .
