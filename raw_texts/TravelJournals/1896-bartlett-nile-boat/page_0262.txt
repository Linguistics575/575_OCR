the river. The breeze being favourable, we did not land
to visit the very curious grottos of El Kab or Eilythias,
of which Miss Martineau, and so many other travellers,
have given vivid descriptions. The temple of Edfou, how-
ever, a very striking object from the river, tempted us
awhile on shore. It stands on rising ground not far from the
Nile, and as the external wall with which it is surrounded is
entire, gives us a complete idea of the vast size and massive
grandeur of an Egyptian temple in its state of completeness,
serving no less as a fortress and a palace for the sacerdotal
caste, than as a place for the solemn rites of religion. We ad—

with ragged Fellahs, and beset by naked children, who raised a
shrill demand of “ beckshish howaga,” accompanied by the

monkeys to the top of the corridors, pursued us with their
impish antics and importunate clamour, till, their position being
stormed, they were driven down with kicks and blows into the
area below, raising in their escape whole clouds of suffocating
dust. Meanwhile, passing between the solemn gateway towers,
which are entirely perfect, we entered the ﬁrst court, which is
also entire, with its surrounding corridor supported by ranges of
light Ptolemaic pillars, the ﬂat roof of which served equally as
a promenade or vantage-ground of defence. At the extremity
of this court, and forming the vestibule of the temple itself, is
