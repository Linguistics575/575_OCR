site. The farther we penetrated into this dreary ravine, the
more desolate became its features; arid rocks, whitening in
the sun, overhung its narrow sandy bed; there was no
vestige of vegetable life; and through these barren and melan-
choly portals we seemed to be penetrating to the very grave of
nature. After tracking the deﬁle for half an hour, the bed of
the ravine, which had gradually narrowed, divided into several
obscure clefts, which penetrated into the bowels of the sand-
stone mountain, and a range of gloomy perpendicular precipices
forbade all further progress. At the foot of this melancholy
barrier, we descried a few dark apertures, like entrances to
subterranean caverns, singularly gloomy and mysterious in
effect; in the rocky walls of the lateral ﬁssures we gradually

hieroglyphics relating to the owner of the tomb, and ﬁgures
emblematical of the passage into the realms of futurity. Here
the guides lighted their candles, and we advanced into the ﬁrst
and most celebrated “ Hall of Beauty.” At the foot of this
passage was formerly a wall, and on the other side the masonry
built up to conceal the entrance to the wonders within'; but
Belzoni, suspecting from different indications that more was be-
yond, forced in the wall with the trunk of a palm, and burst
into the splendid chambers so artfully concealed. His emotions
may well be envied, as he ﬁrst viewed the many ﬁgures, in all
the freshness of yesterday’s colouring, with which the walls of
