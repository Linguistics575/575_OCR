The streets, we ﬁnd, were for the most part very narrow and
impervious to the sun, but some were wider, and along these
we may see rolling the light chariots of the wealthy, accom-
panied by their crowds of servants, and all the varied costumes
of the different castes of society,—the pale intellectual priest, the
bronzed veteran of the eastern campaigns, the tradesman, the
husbandman, and the boatman. The houses in these main
thoroughfares, we learn from Wilkinson, were stately and
elegantly furnished, several stories high, and ornamented with
portals, which, like those of the modern Arabs in Cairo, bore
some religious inscriptions. From their interior courts, we
should have admired, too, the groups of palm trees .arising,
covered with clouds of doves, and the ﬂat roofs, each with its

extended avenues of sphynxes, and along these we might
picture to ourselves religious processions advancing in all their
pomp, or the solemn celebration of the return of one of the
warrior kings from some distant and successful enterprise.

‘bark, was then gay with a variety of vessels, from the splendid
barge of the monarch to the humble ferry boats, which plied
incessantly from the great avenues of Karnak and Luxor across
to the western suburb, and disgorged the crowds who poured
along the dramas, or ‘royal street,’ which formerly connected
the latter temple with the great colossi, which now stand,
solitary, amidst the graves of the countless thousands they have
outlived.

\Ve must not forget the funeral ceremonies, already alluded
to, so important a feature in the manners of the ancient Egyp-
tians. Over the distant lake of Birket Habou, on the right
of the view, might have been seen from time to time. pro-
