race, founded by the Arabs who conquered Egypt from the
Byzantine emperors. The solid wall of the Roman fort which
so long resisted their efforts, is confounded with the surround-
ing buildings and groves. The luxuriant island of Rhoda
is half made out, and nearer at hand those portions of the city,
which were successively added by later Arabian dynasties, as it
gradually receded from the river, and took up its ﬁnal position
under the shelter of the Mokattam crags. Conspicuous in this
now half-ruinous quarter is seen a large square court with a
dome and minaret of singular formation, fast falling into decay.
This is the mosque of Tooloon, the founder of a separate
dynasty, it is remarkable as one of the earliest specimens of
the pointed arch; and, to close this description, which is run-
ning too much into diffuse detail, immediately below is the
noblest mosque‘ in the city, built some centuries later, when
Arabian architecture had attained its highest degree of
enrichment, by Hassan, a sultan of the Baharite Memlook
dynasty. It is a landscape not only indescribably Splendid to
the eye, especially when the sun is sinking behind the pyra-
mids, and ﬂinging long rays of ruby lustre aslant the Nile
valley, to rest for a brief half hour on the craggy crest of the
citadel, and the arabesque fretwork of the lofty minarets; but
its soil is the strand of ages, upon which successive races, from
Sesostris to Saladin, like wave chasing wave, have leﬁ: the monu-
mental traces of their passage; monuments too the more im-
perishable as they recede further into the night of antiquity.

To the traveller not merely anxious to despatch the “ sights ”
of a city, under the guidance of a loquacious Cicerone ; to the
lover of art in all its variety of characteristic invention, in
which the sense of the beautiful is developed in accordance
with the peculiar religion or social system of a people; Cairo
will present a peculiar attraction from its containing, with a few
exceptions, the ﬁnest specimens of the Arabian- architecture in
its mosques, tombs, gates, and private houses, to be met with
in any oriental city.
