tiou that the porticoes were imitated from constructive archi-
tecture, contemporary or of still earlier date, the reverse of
which is however quite as probable. Indeed this tomb
opens a very curious subject for speculation. The interior is
exceedingly simple and elegant, having a central avenue of the
same Doric columns, with a low coved ceiling, which, Wilkin-
son suggests, may have been copied from a stone arch. On
each side is an aisle, and there is a large niche or recess
at the end of the central avenue. The walls having been pre-
pared, and divided by lines into different compartments, were
covered with an elaborate series of representations, which set
before us in a most lively style, and with surprising distinctness,
the domestic manners of that remote period—they are indeed a
mine to the antiquary. This is the ﬁrst time that I had seen
this interesting peculiarity of Egyptian antiquities, and I was
proportionally astonished and delighted. The colours, con-
sidering the antiquity of the tomb, are wonderfully preserved.
In the style of execution there is no great display of art, but
the variety of the paintings is inexhaustible. They em-
brace all the processes of agriculture from sowing to harvest,
with fowling, ﬁshing, and hunting scenes, some of the latter re-
markable for their spirit ; the different trades and occupations,
and even amusements, dancing, wrestling, playing at draughts
and ball, and the mode of administering punishment by the
same process as at the present day, namely, the bastinado. Here
you see, as on the bank of the Nile at the present day, peasants
proceeding to market, bearing their burdens, and driving their
cattle before them, while the different craft on the river are
depicted with equal attention. They have the appearance of
minute and laboriously accurate delineations. It seems as
though nothing pertaining to every-day life was forgotten; a
lively and sometimes half-ludicrous vein runs through the
whole series, which, even to a hasty visitor, rise up with marvel-
lous familiarity and distinctness, while the antiquary is enabled
by a careful analysis to ﬁll up a very complete picture of the
