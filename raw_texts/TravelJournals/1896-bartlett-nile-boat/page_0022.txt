12 A SHIP RUN DOWN.

bay, whose weeds looked too becoming to allow the anticipation
that they would be either renewed or over-worn, made up the
company, all disposed, at this distance from home, to dispense
with introductions, and to amalgamate cordially into one
temporary family.

The weather was at ﬁrst beautiful, but on the second day be-
came squally. We passed the rude wild mountains of Sardinia ;
the wind sunk, but left a heavy swell, which kept me awake to
a late hour in the night: suddenly I was alarmed by a loud
