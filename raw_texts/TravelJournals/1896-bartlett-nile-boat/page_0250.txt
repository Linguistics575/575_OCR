But to return to the great pr0pylon. The ﬁrst view pre-
sented shows the great court to which it gives access; in the
fore-ground is the wall forming its boundary; the corresponding
one opposite is seen attached to the base of the pr0pylon, and,
running up to a small temple, let in, as it were, to the court,
the external wall of which just beyond contains a sculptured
representation of Sheshonk, the Shishak of the Book of Kings,
leading his prisoners, among which it is supposed are the cap-

In the open distant ground beyond this side of the court, ap-

more remote buildings. So bewildering are all these details
that I can scarcely hope to give but a very general idea of them.

We had spent so much time in the examination of Luxor,
and of the other portions of Karnak, that the evening was ad-
