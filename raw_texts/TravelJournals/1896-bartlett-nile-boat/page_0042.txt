branch of the Nile, was cut in 1819, by Mehemet Ali, and
is a fair sample at once of the important improvements intro-
duced by him, at the suggestion, it is said, of Mr. Briggs ; and
of the reckless, despotic haste, bungling mismanagement, and
even cruel indiﬁ'erence to the claims and sufferings of his sub-
jects, with which they are effected. A levy was ordered, and
three hundred thousand men were gathered on the scene of
action ; but, owing to the want of a proper supply of provisions,
or even tools, they were compelled to labour with their hands.
The excavations were lower than the level of the sea,
often deep in the mud, and thus, without adequate food or
shelter from the deleterious atmosphere, and hurried on with
barbarous indifference to life, thirty thousand are said to have
perished in the course of the seven months in which the work
was completed. The canal, dull as it is, is somewhat animated
by the constant passage of boats laden with the rich produce
of the Valley of the Nile ; rice, corn, and cotton, for shipment
at Alexandria—to enrich alone the grasping ruler and a few
merchants, without leaving a trace of prosperity or comfort
among the unhappy people from whose conﬁscated lands it
is reaped, and by whose ill-paid labours it is produced.
There is little to see on its banks beyond a distant glimpse of
Aboukir Bay. One is weary, even before reaching the Nile, at
the characteristics of wretchedness which every where meet the
eye,—at the universal presence of the squalid mud dwelling or
hovel of the Fellah, the naked ﬁlthy children basking among
hosts of yelping dogs, and the clamorous, greasy, blear-
eyed population, whose tattered garments seem alive with
vermin ,—at the disgusting anomaly of men, who, when engaged
in boating, often divest themselves of every rag, while the
women, veiled to the eyes, are striving to hide their ugly faces,
—with many other indescribable spectacles, which indicate
too plainly the absence of ordinary decency in a degraded
people. In vain you look for the presence of any middle
order; with few exceptions, all appear alike, there is but one
