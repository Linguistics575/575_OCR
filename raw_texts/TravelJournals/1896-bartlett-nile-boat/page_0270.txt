he is devoted to.dancing-girls and raki, and proves to be, like
Dr. Olin’s captain, with whom I really believe him to be
identical, “ an incompetent, stupid, and desperately lazy man.”
Our native agent at Keneh had already suggested the bastinado,
and politely offered to see it applied; but I could not consent to
deliver him to the tender mercies of the governor, and now the
ungrateful, indolent villain ﬂatly refused to take me across the
river from Assouan to the opposite side, on some pretence of

the heights beyond, among which lie the celebrated quarries,
are dotted with a few ruined tombs and mosques, which add
the melancholy of decayed monuments of man’s works to the
eternal barrenness of nature. This view gives an excellent

every form and size, through which the Nile pours the treasures
