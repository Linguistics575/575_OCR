“ But,” added the little man, “ entre nous, it is not for the pasha,
but for you English, that I am doing all this, for it is agreed, of
course, that you are to have possession of the country.” To this
speech, which reminded me of Talleyrand’s celebrated saying,
that speech was given to man for the purpose of disguising his
thoughts, I did not of course feel called upon to say anything
in reply. The Italian doctors in the service of the pasha also
did us the honour of a visit. In fact, besides the desire to
lighten their captivity by conversing with a passing stranger,
they have an eye to a little private practice, and generally
add a triﬂe to their slender pay by the inﬁrmities of European
travellers, or the peccadilloes of Mahommedan pilgrims. So
much for Keneh, the most dissolute place in Egypt, upon

which, after a very brief stay, we were happy enough to turn
our backs.
