ously .our course was changed—at one moment, our huge sails,
bellowing, straining with their utmost force through the boiling
torrent, we seemed bearing down upon a pile of granite, against
which our bark would have crashed like an egg-shell, when al-
most touching it the voice of the Nubian would be heard, loud
and clear above the roar of the troubled waters, and a sudden
shift of our canvass would bring us up on the edge of a sandy
shoal—nervous work enough for a few minutes; till re-assured
against peril by the calmness and dexterity of our pilot, we
could feel enough at ease to enjoy the wild and exciting scene
around, which assumed a new aspect with every turn of the
helm. It would seem as though Osiris and Typhon, princi-
ples of life and death—of the fertile valley and the arid desert,
seen ever side by side in this wonderful land, had met in
ﬁercest conﬂict, and in the midst of the coil of the half-prisoned
river, left traces of a doubtful struggle for the mastery. Here
rises, sheer from the ﬂood, a huge pile of black and frowning
basalt, intermingled with rose-coloured syenite, and veined with

Such is fair Sehayl, its fragrant groves and thickets reposing
with an aspect so poetical, such an air of cekstial peacefulness,
in the midst of surrounding convulsion, we wonder not that it
should have been held sacred, and placed under the special
protection of the goddesses Saté and Anouké, the Grecian Juno
and Vesta. The multitude of these obstructions, wildly thrown
together, and of every size, from large islands to single rocks,
scarce peeping above the roaring current at this season of the
Nile’s rise, taxed to the utmost the skill and attention of our pilot.
To thread such a labyrinth without accident seemed impossible.

Fully to complete the strangeness of the picture should be
added the feats and antics of the denizens of this extraordinary
region, some of which, however, we did not happen to wit-
