DEPARTURE FROM OLD CAIRO. 111

rapidly, to the sound of the darrabuka, along the narrow chan-
nel separating the island of Rhoda from Old Cairo. This
suburban scenery of the Nile is very charming. The light,
gay villas and latticed harems of the wealthy Turks, half
buried in rustling date groves and gardens, project over the
river, which is animated by the constant passage of boats dart-
ing about with their great white sails, like birds, under the
lively evening breeze which waited the odours from the ad-
jacent gardens across the stream. It is a delightful sensa-
tion too, when, with stores laid in and preliminary troubles
over, one ﬁrst sees the broad latine sails of the bark ex-
panding to the steady breeze which is to waft it among the
wonders of early time, the temples and the tombs of mighty
Thebes.

I shall never forget the moment when the boat shot out of
the narrow channel of Rhoda, and issued into the magniﬁcent
river, rolling in its full breadth between groves of palm. The
sun was setting red upon the pyramids, seen afar beyond the
level green valley, and burnishing the sands of the Libyan
desert; the wind raised vast clouds of dust, tinged with the
ruddy beams, and driving across towards the stream, the red-
dening sails caught the gust, which freshened as the sun set,
and as we dashed rapidly through the seething waters, Cairo
and its minarets on the eastern banks, the mounds of Baby-
lon and the crags of Mokattam on the west, the long suc-
cession of pyramids seen stretching far away to the site of
ancient Memphis, all mingled into ruddy haze and twilight
obscurity. We made great way, but missing the channel we
became involved among a maze of sandy islands, and I had a
rough introduction to a common incident in Nile navigation.
I had hardly lay down to rest, when I was thrown off my bench
upon the ﬂoor by a sudden jerk ;—we had run upon a shoal: the
boatmen, stripping off their scanty attire, leaped into the water,
shouting and singing in chorus, and speedily engaged in get-
ting oﬂ' the vessel, an operation which consumed some time.
