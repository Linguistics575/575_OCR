OBJECT or THE PYRAMIDS. 107

The erection of the pyramids has been generally attributed
to the arbitrary tyranny of the dynasty, as some have thought,
of foreign origin, who then ruled over Egypt. Herodotus
tells us that Cheops was detested by the Egyptians, whose
temples he had closed, and that he employed them forcibly in
the exhausting labour of building the great pyramid. Great
doubts seem to rest over this and other statements of the
partially informed Greek historian, and it has latterly been
maintained that these stupendous monuments were, on the con-
trary, erected by gradual and easy degrees, by paid labour, and
at government expense; serving, in fact, the most useful and
beneﬁcent design of giving employment to the poorer classes
of a vast agricultural population, conﬁned by nature on a mere
strip of alluvial soil, when thrown idle three months in the
year by the inundation of the Nile.’

It is confessedly, however, hardly the moment to enlarge
upon the subject of the pyramids, when so much light is about
to be thrown upon it by the publication of Dr. Lepsius’s re-
searches. We have conﬁned ourselves, therefore, to a descrip-
tion of the more prominent and obvious points, and of the
general results of modern investigations. We shall now return
to Cairo, and prepare for a continuation of our journey.
