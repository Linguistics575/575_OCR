another, the exhilaration of our pious Mussulman entertainer
seemed to know no bounds. At the loud clapping of hands, a
female slave had entered with a large tray covered with the
choicest delicacies of Arab cookery—chopped meat rolled up
in the leaves of vegetables, and other and more recherche dishes,
of exquisite piquancy of ﬂavour; this was placed before us on
a small stool, together with spoons for our especial use. To
complete our entertainment, we were favoured with a specimen
of the talents of an Almeh, or singing woman, confounded by
so many travellers with the Ghawazee, or dancing girls. In .
long low strains she began to chant a lugubrious romance,
probably some tale of hapless love and woe; her monotonous
cadences would have driven Hotspur mad, worse than

“ To hear a brazen can’stick turn’d,
Or a dry wheel grate on an axletree ; "

but as the story proceeded, the lady appeared rapt, the tears
ﬁlled her eyes, and she exhibited every sign of the deepest
emotion; so different are the modes by which the same
universal feelings may be affected.

Shortly after, we took our leave. On my way home, I could
not but remark to Mr. Farren, that the favourite wife of our_
host was by no means equal in point of beauty to some of her
less privileged inmates of the harem. He replied that he had
also noticed this, and mentioned it to the old Moollah, who had
frankly explained the reasons of his preference. She alone, he
said, could devise amusements for him, converse with him, and
lighten the monotony of his vacant hours. Perhaps too she
was no less skilled in those peculiar arts which form the study
of oriental women ; for, however some may delight to paint the
life of the harem ‘ en beau,’ we suspect it is but a sad mixture
of mere ennui and sensuality.

There are numerous interesting excursions to be made from
Cairo. The pleasantest are to Shoubra, Rhoda, Heliopolis,
