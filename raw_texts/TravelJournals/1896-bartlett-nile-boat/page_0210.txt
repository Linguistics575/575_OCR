boat—of elegant and graceful form, and others scarcely less
splendid conveyed the rest of the mourners to the opposite
shore, forming, as depicted in the tombs, a most magniﬁcent
spectacle. Here the procession was again formed to convey the
body to the tomb, on reaching which the sarcophagus was
placed erect in the chamber, while a priest performed a sacriﬁce,
and the nearest relatives, with loud wailings, extolled the
virtues of the deceased, which were repeated by the rest of the
mourners.

We read in Scripture that the wicked kings of Israel were not
allowed to be “ gathered to the sepulchres of their fathers ” with
honour. Such was also the case with certain of the Egyptian
kings. When, after the embalming of the body and a variety of
ceremonies, the cofﬁn was brought to the brink of the sacred
lake, to be ferried over to his tomb, a sort of preliminary trial
of the deceased took place, who might be deprived of an hon-
ourable funeral, and of admission to the consecrated sepulchres,
by public and unanswerable testimony to his crimes.

As we emerge from these dark halls, scarcely illuminated by
candles or the ﬁres of straw and brush, which the reckless
traveller lights in their recesses, what a contrast is there to the
blinding day above—the burning sand and rock of the desolate
valley, more sad than the sepulchres hollowed in its rocky
sides. I was glad to escape from it again into the neighbouring
tomb, called after the celebrated Bruce, whose description of a
harper upon its walls occasioned so much ridicule and reproach.
This is not so irregular as the one described, nor are the
chambers so numerous or intricate, but it pierces 405 feet on
a more gradual slope into the mountain-side. The sculptures
are more intelligible and interesting to the unlearned visitor, for
they exhibit domestic and culinary usages—different boats,
arms and armour, furniture of all descriptions; agricultural
scenes, birds, fruits, and other natural productions} with
a clearness and minuteness equally amusing and startling; for
these familiar representations are not less than 3500 years old,
