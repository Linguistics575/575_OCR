 

POPULATION or ALEXANDRIA. l7

“ There was nothing of the old Egyptian gravity and stability of
character, says Sharpe, amidst the Alexandrian populace. Cor-
rupted by wealth, and destitute of freedom, they seemed eager
after nothing but food and horse races, those never-failin g
bribes for which the idle of every country will sell all that a
man should hold most dear. A scurrilous song or a horse race
would so rouse them into a quarrel, they could not hear for
their own noise. They made but second-rate soldiers, while
as singing-boys at the supper tables of the wealthy Romans
they were much sought after, and all the world acknowledged
that there were no ﬁghting cocks equal to those reared by
the Alexandrians.”

The splendour thus described has left scarce a wreck be-
hind; science and the muses have long since advanced west-
ward; but in the character of the population, at least, there
remains a strong resemblance to the ancient city of the Ptole-
mies. Sullen repulsive-looking Copts replace the exclusive
old Egyptians, their reputed ancestors; Greeks and Jews too
swarm as before, both, possibly, changed a little for the worse ;
nor would it perhaps be any great injustice to the mass of
Levantines, or, with of course honourable exceptions, to the
F ranks, who make up the sum of the population, even now to
designate them as the “sweepings” of their respective coun-
tries. The streela swarm with Turks in splendid many-
coloured robes, half naked brown-skinned Arabs, glossy
Negroes in loose white dresses and vermilion turbans, sordid
shabby-looking Israelites in greasy black, smart, jaunty, rakish
Greeks, staid heavy-browed Armenians, unkempt, unwashed
Maltese ragamuﬂins, and Europeans of every shade of respect-
ability, from lordly consuls down to refugee quacks and swind-
lers, and criminals who here get whitewashed and established
anew. Here a Frank lady in the last Parisian bonnet; there
Turkish women enveloped to the eyes in shapeless black wrap-
pers; while dirty Christian monks, sallow Moslem dervishes, °
sore-eyed beggars, naked children covered with ﬂies, and troops
