on our way to the temple, an ignoble welcome to this scene of
majestic ruin. From its beautiful situation on a rising ground
above the Nile, the temple of Luxor must have had a singularly
ﬁne effect in its pristine perfection, but it is now perhaps the
least interesting of all the buildings of Thebes, being so dis-
guised by the mud hovels and paltry buildings of the modern
village, clustered around the base of the columns or piled upon
the tops of the colonnades, that few portions assume any grandeur
of effect. The view I have selected will illustrate these remarks,
and give an idea of the great extent of the ediﬁce, the details of
which I shall not attempt to describe. One noble group of
objects, however, must not be dismissed without especial notice
—the celebrated obelisk and propylaaa, or gateway towers,
through which lay the approach to the courts of the temple
within, and of which the camera drawing will I hope convey an
accurate impression. Of the two obelisks of red granite which
formerly stood here, one now embellishes the Place de la
Concorde at Paris ; the other, though deeply buried in sand, is
one of the ﬁnest monuments of Thebes; the depth of the
hieroglyphics, about 2 inches, is unusual, and gives to them an
extraordinary relief and sharpness. Two sitting statues of
Rameses II., also half covered with sand, appear behind the
obelisks and add much to the grandeur of the entrance ; the dark
grey hue of the granite contrasts ﬁnely with the sand, and the
puny squalid ﬁgures passing and repassing, give a vastness
and solemnity to these colossal wrecks. Behind towers a noble
propylon, though its effect is much impaired by the ruin
of the bold cornice which gave it so grand and imposing a
termination ; its immense level facade is crowded with the in-
cidents of a tumultuous battle scene, the stone is alive with the
shock of warring squadrons; on one compartment the triumph-
ant king is driving his chariot upon hosts of ﬂying enemies ; on
the other, he is represented after victory, seated on his throne,
the vanquished monarch bound to his chariot-wheels awaits
the pleasure of his conqueror; other suppliants bend before
