ON THE SEA.

THE BEGINNING OF THE TRIP.

IT SEEMS like a long time since I was notiﬁed Of my selection
by the Bishops as a delegate to the Ecumenical Conference Of
Methodism in London. But the time to start at last has come,
and I am Off on my long journey.

On the evening Of August 8,1901, at seven O’clock, our train
started. If the many expressed wishes for a pleasant journey
and a safe return count for anything, you may look for me back
in due time to tell you of the abiding love and protecting care of
a loving Heavenly Father. These cordial and heartfelt expres-
sions, coming from so many, make me love God and his people
more and better than ever.

Friends met me at Sacramento, notwithstanding the lateness
Of the hour (eleven, P. M.), with more than a “God bless you,”
for they added to my lunch-basket, and to my purse as well.
Such friends deserve to be held in everlasting remembrance.

As Often as I have crossed the continent, I have never gone by
the Northern Paciﬁc, SO I concluded to try that route. This
necessitated a trip entirely through the state Of Oregon and about
one half Of Washington to Tacoma.

The ﬁrst morning found me above Redding. As we went up
the Sacramento River, the stream dwindled, until one could wade
it at almost any point. As we neared Mount Shasta, the growth
and the scenery began to change. Tall pines, in their excurrent

while feathery ferns decorated the moist earth at their feet. Old
