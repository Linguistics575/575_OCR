22 MY TRIP TO THE ORIENT.

The last evening on board was spent in auctioning off some
sketches made on the' voyage,——for we had two very ﬁne artists
on board, who expect to make their fortunes on the Continent by
selling their pictures,—and in recitations, anecdotes, and song.
I told them my celebrated Yosemite bear story, whose relation is
so blood-curdling, and whose dénouemcnt is so gratifying. The
money realized from the sale of the pictures is to go for the bene-
ﬁt of the widows and orphans of sailors. It amounted to “three
pounds one and sixpence,”—we use English money over here.

From the time we entered the channel to landing at the dock,
we saw no more of the captain. Grave reaponsibilities rested on
him, and he was upon the bridge day and night, even taking his
meals there.

What a lesson we ministers of Jesus Christ could learn from
this. We have a responsibility graver than his committed to our
hands. The very lives, not for time, but for eternity, of our people
are in our keeping, and there is danger of wreck, even at the en-
trance of the harbor. We reached our dock in a few hours over
eleven days.

On landing at London, Dr. Giﬂin, who had visited it a number
of times before, and was familiar with the city, was of great as-
sistance to me. We came to the Hotel Russell, a very nice place,
where we will remain until the opening of the Conference, when
homes will be assigned us.
