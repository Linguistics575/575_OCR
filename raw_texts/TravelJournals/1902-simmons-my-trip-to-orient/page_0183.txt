MY TRIP TO THE ORIENT. 183

I ’ve sized up the Russian, the Frenchman, the Jap:
But there ’s only one land, after all, on the map.
Low land, high land,

Ocean, or river, or dry land,

There ’3 no other equal to my land;

There .’s only one country for me;

”1‘ is a gem any nation might covet;

’T is the land of my birth, and I love it,

For :the Stars and the Stripes ﬂoat above it, —

Hats off to the Land of the Free! ”
