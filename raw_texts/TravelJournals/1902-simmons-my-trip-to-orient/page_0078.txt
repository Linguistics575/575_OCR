78 MY TRIP TO THE ORIENT.

of the sun, and drenched by the rains of heaven, how could a
remnant of it have survived? And yet here it is; and we, more
than two thousand years after its erection, walk amid its broken
columns and shattered friezes, and look up with wonder at shafts
of marble, chiseled by hands that have been moldering in the
grave for more than a score of centuries, still standing where
they placed them, with scarcely a trace of their beauty gone.

We look far off to a mountain in the east, and see a scar gleam-
ing in the setting sun on its side, and are told that that is the
quarry whence all this wealth of architecture and sculpture came.
For ages, men have been digging into the heart of this mountain,
fashioning its hard, snowy treasure into columns and ﬁgures that
have adorned all Greece, and been sent round the world. And
yet it is not exhausted. When we had satisﬁed ourselves with

Lord and Master as the vehicle through which, in these last times,
to speak to his beloved, all passed in review in that magic scene.
To the left was Mars’ Hill, and on it stood the great Apostle to
the Gentiles, sweeping the horizon of the world with his vision,
looking up to the very throne of the Eternal, with one hand
pointing above, the other spread out over earth and heaven, with
his back to the Parthenon and his face to Calvary, exclaiming
with the voice Of an archangel: “God, that made the world and
