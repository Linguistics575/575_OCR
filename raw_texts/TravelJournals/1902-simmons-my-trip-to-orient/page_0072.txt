Italy and Greece are also the lands of the olive as well as the
vine. We were hardly ever out of sight of olive trees. They
were growing in the rich valleys, and up among the rocks on the
mountain side.' .Great portions of the country, especially the

millions of people who live largely off the proceeds of their vines
and olive trees, while we have millions of acres that would grow
the olive, especially, to greater perfection. Ripe olives are used
everywhere here. But I have never but once seen a green olive,
