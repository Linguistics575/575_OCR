164 MY TRIP TO THE ORIENT.

The valley of J ehoshaphat, lying between Jerusalem and
' Mount Olivet, is very narrow, and can hardly be called a valley.
The brook Kedron passes down through it, but at this season of
the year it is perfectly dry. The valley of Jehoshaphat widens
out into the valley of Hinnom, where the offal of this great city
was burned in the olden times.

Absalom’s tomb is on the edge of the valley of J ehoshaphat. I
think I should have recognized it from the pictures of it I have
seen.

BETHANY.

Bethany and Bethphage of Christ’s time are not what they
were then. They now number but a few very ordinary houses,
and all have an air of neglect.

GETHSEMANE.

I was disappointed in what is called the Garden of Gethsemane.
It is a little inclosure near the base of Olivet, with six or seven
old olive trees. Flowers are growing in profusion all inside of
the iron inclosure. The dimensions of it by no means answer to
the demands of Scripture. They tell us that He took His disciples
into a garden, requested them to pray with Him, then taking the
three, He went still farther, and leaving them, He went about a
stone’s-cast farther. Now, all this would require a space of a
hundred yards or more; but this garden is hardly ﬁfty feet across,

either way. It may occupy part of the garden site, but not all
of it. -
