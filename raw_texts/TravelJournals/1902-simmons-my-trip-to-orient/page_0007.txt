PREFACE.

- FROM early manhood I have had a consuming desire to visit
classic and Bible lands, but never till in my seventy-ﬁfth year'
did the opportunity offer itself; and from the beginning of my
journey I have had in mind the'relatiOn of what I saw and
.heard _ for the beneﬁt of my friends and the reading public.
- ' While in many instances'I‘ have used the guide-books that were
available, I have not leant upon them, except where it was neces-
sary to get facts and ﬁgures. . I have tried to see, and to think,-
and to write for myself. With Bible in hand, I have accepted -
nothing, whatever tradition might say, if not substantiated by it.
I do not claim infallibility for my book, but I have adhered
strictly to facts, where it was possible to secure these facts. I
have sought for information from the best sources at hand, and
from notes taken on the ground I have written while matters

were fresh in my mind.
