MY TRIP TO THE ORIENT. 97

As I wandered over these deserted ruins, and later, as in the
cities of Asia Minor, ‘as well as in Greece and Italy, and saw the
cloud that rests on all these lands, and heard the call to prayers
from the minarets, where Christ is forgotten, I asked, Was all of
Paul’s labor lost? And had a moral de’bris covered the beautiful
church of Jesus Christ forever from the pure light of heaven?
and will no faithful, loving hand remove the pall, and let the
living light of heaven fall once more upon it?

Paul is gone, Corinth is no more, but while darkness may cover
this land, and gross darkness this people, yet the Sun of
Righteousness still shines, and in the far West he bathes the
nations in a ﬂood of light, and Paul, through his epistles, written
originally to churches now dead and buried, cheers and comforts
multiplied millions of the devout followers of our Lord Jesus
Christ. The prophet, when he heard a voice saying, “Cry,”
turning his eye aloft, asked, “What shall I cry?” and the answer
came, “ All ﬂesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the ﬂower
of grass. The grass withereth, and the ﬂowers thereof falleth
away; but the word of the Lord endureth forever.”

So God’s word shall not return —has not returned—to him void,
and lands that are afar off rejoice in the glorious light. And as the
sun sweeps round the world, enlightening every land, may we not
look for the glory of God to follow on, until this land, once the
cradle of the Church, and this peOple, once his peculiar treasure,
become his again?
