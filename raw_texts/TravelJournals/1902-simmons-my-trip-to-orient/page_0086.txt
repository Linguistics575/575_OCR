86 MY TRIP TO THE ORIENT.

point; and that they might leave out no divinity, they had
erected an altar “TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.” This he takes
as his text, claiming to be to them a revealer of this unknown
God,—Him “whom ye ignorantly worship declare I unto you.”
Pointing, not to the Acropolis crowned with its temple made with
hands, the glory of all Greece, and wonder of the world, but to
the heavens above, the blue sea, and the mountains, and the
plain, he exclaimed, “God that made the world and all things
therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not
in temples made with hands [pointing to that before them];
neither is worshiped with men’s hands, as though he needed any-
thing [such as the gifts piled about the image of Minerva], seeing
he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things: and hath made
of one blood all nations of men [pointing to the representatives
of all nations before him], for to dwell on all the face of the earth,
and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds
of their habitation; that they should seek the Lord, if haply they
might feel after him, and ﬁnd him, though he be not far from
every one of us; for in him we live, and move, and have our be-
ing [even this you know]; as certain also of your own poets have
said, ‘For we are his offspring.’ Forasmuch then as we are
the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is
like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man’s device
[such as occupy your temples, even the material of which was
made by God]. And the times of this ignorance God winked at, '
[he brings it home to them with all authority]; but now com-
mandeth all men everywhere to repent: because he hath appointed
a day [not night, beneath the moon’s light, as individual culprits
come], in which he will judge the world in righteousness, by that
man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance
unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.”

Judge ALL MEN, not only the living, but the dead. The sleepers
in yon graveyard should rise, and stand before this Judge, no
one hiding in the shadow, no one overlooked.

The impression was deep and pungent; and although some re-
ferred the matter to another day, saying, “We will hear thee
again of this matter,” yet “certain men clave unto him, and be-
lieved; among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite [the very
ruler of the temple that overshadowed them], and a woman
named Damaris, and others with them.”
