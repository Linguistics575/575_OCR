MY TRIP TO THE ORIENT. 181

ALEXANDRIA.

Our stay in Egypt was a most delightful one, and we enjoyed
it greatly; but the time had come when we must turn our faces
to our Western home. A run of a few hours by rail brought us
to Alexandria. We stayed in this ancient city but a short time.
During that time, however, we visited Pompey’s Pillar, saw the
site of the ancient Pharos, one of the Seven Wonders of the World,
and had shown to us where the celebrated Alexandrian Library
was burned. It was in Alexandria that the Septuagint version of
the Old Testament was made, —- the version from which our
Lord made his quotations. No doubt but that the translators
came here to do their work because of the great library in
this city. ' .If this be so, it bespeaks the value of this great
collection. Recorded facts and important information may have
been lost in the destruction of this library. Questions that have
for centuries puzzled the world may have been answered in
some of these volumes; such as, how the great stones thatcom-
pose the Pyramids, and how the immense columns with their
architraves of ruined temples, were lifted. to their places; how
elastic and malleable glass were made; by what process the royal
purple was manufactured; and many others. .

NAPLES.

Taking a steamer at Alexandria, we sped on toward Naples.
In passing the island of Sicily we had a ﬁne view of Mount-Etna.
Neither ﬂame nor smoke issued from the crater. .A crown. of
snow lay on its brow. It was Sunday as we passed the Strait of
Messina, between Sicily and the mainland, and just before we
passed Scylla and Charybdis, one on the one side and the other
on the other, we held service in the dining—room of the-ship.
When we reached Naples we visited the Museum. Oneobject
seen there deeply interested me.
