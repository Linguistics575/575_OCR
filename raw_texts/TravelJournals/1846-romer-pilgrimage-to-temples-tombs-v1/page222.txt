NIGHT SCENE. 203

behind the Arabian hills, is shedding a ﬂood of
brilliance over stream and desert, crag and sand,
imparting softness and reﬁnement to that which

in the light of day was wild, and savage, and bar-
ren even to desolation. From afar comes the
faint baying of the chacal, and nought else but
that mournful sound is to be heard! I some-
times wonder, when I look around me, at my
feelings of security in these far solitudes, sur-
rounded by a crew of wild Arabs, and far beyond
the reach of Christian communication or protec-
tion, save that which is comprised in the few in-
dividuals of our own party. Yet I have never
known a moment’s apprehension since I left
Cairo; and such is my reliance on the good faith
of every person serving us, that I would trust
myself to the end of the world with them; and I
lie down to rest every night, secure that not one
of these poor F ellahs would suffer harm to ap-
proach us. They are so unused to kindness, that
a very little of it exhibited towards them wins
their enthusiastic gratitude; and although it is
the fashion to say that Arabs are only to be led
by blows, I have had opportunities of testing that
they are far more amenable to gentleness and
good feeling. \Vould that their rulers thought

so too !
