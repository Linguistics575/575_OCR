280 TIPSY TURKEY.

bird is killed, a glass of brandy is poured down
its throat, which produces complete intoxication,
and the ﬂesh of the tipsy turkey acquires a ten—

a state of Moslem reprobation, is a curious bear-

Signor Castellare visited us in the evening, and
sent me a present of fresh butter—a great dainty
in this part of the world ; albeit I cannot taste it,
as it is made of bufi'aloe’s milk, to the ﬂavour of

you how turkeys are made tender in Egypt, I
may as well tell you also how butter is churned.
The milk is put into a skin precisely similar to
those used by the water-carriers at Cairo, and
shaken by two persons until the butter is formed,
when it is separated from the butter-milk,
washed, and melted down into jars; this butter,
here called Ghee, has always a strong taste of the
skin, but it is nevertheless very good for culinary
purposes.
