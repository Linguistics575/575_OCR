Sir Gardiner \Vilkinson to be as old as the reign
of Osirtasen, the Pharaoh of Joseph, or rather
the Pharaoh under whose reign he came into
Egypt, as the Patriarch’s long life comprised the
reigns of ﬁve Kings. 'If this be the case, they
rank in antiquity next to the Pyramids, which
are the oldest monuments, not only in Egypt,
but in the world. The paintings in them,
although less brilliant in colourng than those
in the tombs of the Kings at Thebes, are, if
possible, still more interesting, as affording us
glimpses into the manners and customs of a far
more remote antiquity. The subjects are of a
less striking and imposing character; for instead
of triumphal processions and mystical allegories,
they are conﬁned to more familiar subjects, such
as agriCultural and domestic occupations. A
great portion of these designs are devoted to
gymnastic exercises, especially wrestling, which
seems to have been a favourite amusement of
the ancient Egyptians, and brought to great per-
fection by them, as the most ingenious methods
of attack and defence are there represented.
Sporting scenes are also introduced, the animals,
especially the antelopcs or gazellos, beautifully
drawn; and there are some curious evidences

of the bastinado having been as much in vogue
