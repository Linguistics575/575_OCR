Korosko, Dec. 14, 1845.

LAST evening we reached this place, and were
again visited by Monsieur d’Arnault, who took
tea with us. At a later hour we landed, and
witnessed a national ballet which Mohammed
had organized for our entertainment on the sum-
mit of a high bank overlooking the river. The
decorations‘ were worthy of the performance;
on one side a group of stately palm-trees, on
the other an immense herd of dromedaries te-
thered and tied to pickets; in the back-ground
the Desert with a Bedouin encampment on its
skirt; fantastically-shaped mountains bounding
the scene, and the whole lighted up by the
glorious moon and myriads of resplendent stars.
