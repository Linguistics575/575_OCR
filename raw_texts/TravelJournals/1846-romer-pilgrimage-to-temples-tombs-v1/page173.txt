154 DISENCIIANTMEN’I‘.

There, my ﬁrst occupation was to see what
Champollion said about it, when—judge of my
mortiﬁcation—I discovered that my enthusiasm
had run riot mal apropos! for instead of ﬁnd-
ing that my admiration was sanctioned by the
judgment of that high-priest of hieroglyphics,
I found that he declared Esneh to be of the
lowest order of Egyptian temples—enﬂn, as
they say in France, c’est la petite biére! What
my unpractised eye had been revelling upon
as the supposed ovals of the Thothmes, the
Amenephons, and the Rhamses, Monsieur
Champollion, who read those hieroglyphics as
you and I would read the [Morning Post, has
pronounced to be those of Domitian, Trajan,
Claudius, Titus, 8w. ; and all that is visible of
Esneh to belong to “des temps modernes—un
des monumens les plus récemment achevés,”—
in short, a miserable modern item in the re-
trospect of ages that one has to deal with in
this country, only dating from the time of the
Roman domination, a paltry eighteen hundred
years ago! So, you see, what his learning
taught him to despise, my ignorance led me
to delight in; and I much question whether
any of the monuments of high antiquity that
are before me, will occasion me more wonder
