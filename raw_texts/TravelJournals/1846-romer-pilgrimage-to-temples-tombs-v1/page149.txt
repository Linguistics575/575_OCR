130 A MEETING.

are discussing a bottle of Guinness’s porter, I
am scribbling away in all haste, in order that
I may “Sign, seal, and deliver” .my despatches
to Mr. D., who has kindly volunteered to take
charge of them, and post them from Cairo——
an opportunity not to be lost. So, for the pre-
sent, fare thee well !
