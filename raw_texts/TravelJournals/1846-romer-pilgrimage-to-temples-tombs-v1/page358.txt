TURKISH DINNER. 335

Thus terminated Seid Husseynâ€™s hospitalities;
and we rode to the Dahabieh lighted by two of
his slaves with fenooses, and attended not only
by Mohammed, but by Reis Ali and four of our
sailors, who came armed with long sticks to
escort us back to the boat, and awakened the
echoes of Kenneh with their joyous choruses as
they gambolled before us, performing all sorts
of antics.
