SOFIA. 275

dress is the prettiest part of the Egyptian costume,
and Soﬁa’s was exceedingly rich. Her hair was
divided into twenty or thirty small braids hanging
over her shoulders, to the end of each of which
were afﬁxed three silk cords strung with gold
coins of various sizes. Two rows of gold coins
as large as half-crown pieces, laid close together,
encircled her forehead; and at each temple de-
pended a cluster of smaller ones, with an agate
ornament in the middle. The back of her head
was covered with a small Egyptian Fez, orna-
mented with a large Ckoors of solid gold, and
bound on by a handkerchief of embroidered
crape. She wore two necklaces of large gold
coins, thickly strung together, and each indivi-
dual piece of money depending from a massive
ornament in the form of a ﬁsh: one of these
necklaces was long, and the other one just encir-
cled her throat; and between them was a string
of beads of Egyptian agates as large as birds’
eggs, and strung together with golden links.
Her ear-rings were of gold ﬁligree, in the shape
of flowers; and her bracelets, of which she wore
several, of massive gold and silver. We com-
puted that she carried about three hundred and

ﬁfty pounds on her person in coins alone, without

including her other ornaments.
