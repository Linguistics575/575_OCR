PLEASURES OF POLYGAMY. 165

with fresh dates. The women were tattooed,
befringed, and beringed as I have above de-
scribed; the little children terriﬁed at the appear-
ance of the ﬁrst white face they had ever seen, set
up a deafening squall, and could not be persuaded
to approach me. I dare say that henceforward,

whenever they are naughty, they will be threaten-
ed with a visit from the White Woman, just as
children in England are menaced by their nurses,
when unmanageable, with the Black Illa”.

As I rode away, I asked the Hadgee how he
contrived to keep the peace between his two
wives, and Whether there were not occasionally
jealousies to disturb his tranquillity? He naive-
ly answered, “wry often, for whenever I pay
more attention to one than to the other, the
neglected one is sure to pick a quarrel with
her rival—and then,” he added philosophically,
“I go out and leave them to ﬁght it out by
themselves, telling them when I return, that
nothing makes a woman look so ugly in her hus-
band’s eyes, as putting herself in a passion—and
that is the only notice I ever take of their
quarrels.” ‘

“ But,” said I, “ if you would content yourself
with one wife, all such jealousies would be out of

the question.”
