been serviceable in pointing out what I ought to
elect, and what to reject; but he has, in the
most disinterested manner, lent me books which he
might naturally have tempted me to purchase, and
has indeed placed his whole library at my dispo-
sition ever since I have been here. Among other
kindnesses, Mr. Muir has lent me an English
side-saddle to take with me, an object which, in
the ignorance of what would be required in such
a journey, I neglected providing myself with on
leaving home; indeed, his zeal and obliging at-
tentions have been unceasing, and can never be
sufﬁciently commended by me; and I should be
ungrateful indeed did I not eagerly testify to my
grateful sense of them, and of the obligations they
have laid me under to him.

We have secured our passage in the French
steamer L’Alexandre, which will arrive here from
Marseilles, on the 27th, and is to leave on the
evening of the same day for Alexandria; and
these preliminaries having been all settled, we
shall subside into a state of idle repose during the

remainder of our stay here.
Farewell then, until I reach the shores of

Egypt !
