And beautiful it is, whether in the brightness
of the noonday sun, when its streets are Ô¨Ålled
with a population rendered motley by the mix-

fancy oneself transported two centuries back to
the palmy days of the Knights of St. John, and
expect to be challenged from the bastions by
some steel-clad soldier of the Cross, instead of the
