APPENDIX. 623

there must have existed in the Cataracts a bar to the river much greater than what
is now to be found there; that owing to this bar, the Nile in those times rose in
Nubia, not in Egypt, to a height never attained now, and thereby formed the deposit
of fertile soil which we found in Upper Nubia, at distances and heights wholly
unaccountable from its present rise; that at a later period this bar was broken down
by some great revolution, which also caused the {all of the above-mentioned blocks,
and in consequence of which the waters above the Cataracts were brought down to
the same level as those below them, and thus deprived Nubia to a great extent of
the beneﬁt of the inundation—For a more detailed account,I must refer to Dr.
Lepsius‘s able development of his views in his Report to the Berlin Academy of
Sciences, where will also be seen the connection which he most ingeniously estab-
lishes between these water-marks, belonging almost exclusively to one reign, and
the great works said to have been executed by King Maaris for the irrigation of the
Fayoom and Lower Egypt.”——Rq)ort of the Egyptian Society, 1845.—pp. 13—14.
