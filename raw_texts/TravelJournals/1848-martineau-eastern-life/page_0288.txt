“ If I have beheld the Sun in his splendor,
Or the Moon advancing in brightness,
And my heart have been secretly enticed,
And my month have kissed my hand,—
This also were a crime to be punished by the judge;
For I should have denied the God who is above."
Job, XXXI. 26-28.

“Celsus seemeth here to me to do just as if a man traveling‘into Egypt, where
the wise men of the Egyptians, according to their country-learning, philosophize
much about those things that are. accounted by them divine, whilst the idiots, in the
meantime, hearing only certain tables which they' know not the meaning of, are
very much pleased therewith: Celsus, I say, doth as if such a sojourner in Egypt,
who had conversed only with those idiots, and not been at all instructed by any of
the priests in their arcane and recondite mysteries, should boast that he knew all
that belonged to the Egyptian theology. What we have now afﬁrmed concerning
the diﬂ‘erence between the wise men and the idiots amongst the Egyptians, the same
may be said also of the Persians, amengst whom the religious rites are performed
rationally by those that are ingenious, whilst the superﬁcial vulgar look no further
in the observation of them than the external symbol or ceremony.”—On'gm against
Odom.

“ And he who had believed (Moses) said, ‘0 my people, follow, me: I will direct
you into the right way. . . . . 0 my people, how is it that I invite you unto salva-
tion, and ye invite meunto the ﬁre? Ye invite me to deny God, and to associate
with Him that of which I have no knowledge; but I invite you unto the Mighty,
the Very Forgiving.’ "—Kwa'n, ch. XL.
