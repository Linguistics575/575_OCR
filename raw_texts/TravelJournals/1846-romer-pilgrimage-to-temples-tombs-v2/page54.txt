COPT WEDDING. 41

The large room into which we were ushered
was covered with beautiful Persian carpets, and
lighted not only by a large chandelier but by a
number of wax lights of enormous dimensions
contained in very tall silver candlesticks placed
upon the ground. I was seated in the corner of
ceremony of the divan, against a window over-
looking the crowded court below, from whence I
could see the proceedings of the fantasia, and
hear the songs of the Alméf“ or famous singing
women, who usually attend all the wealthy wed-
dings of the Caireens, and are paid by the contri-
butions of the guests at a rate which our most
eminent Italian artists would be glad to receive;
and there c/zz'boaqaes, narghilés, coffee, sweetmeats,
and sherbet were served to us.

After half an hour passed among the taciturn
Copt guests, whose gloomy countenances appear
to have no afﬁnity with the lively Arabs of Egypt,
and in whose downcast eyes and dark brows may
be traced the stigma of a people who betrayed

* The Almé have been frequently confounded by travellers,
and, more strange to say, by writers upon Egypt, with the
Ghawazee, or dancing girls, a race inferior to them in all
respects. The Almé (a term which signiﬁes “a learned
female,”) are highly accomplished, and generally unite the
gift of composition and the improvisation of verses to their
musical talents.
