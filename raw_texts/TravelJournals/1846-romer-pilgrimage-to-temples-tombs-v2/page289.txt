276 CEREMONY CONCLUDED.

left there, and the gates were closed upon it. A
sermon preached in Spanish at the Holy Sepulchre
terminated the ceremony at midnight, and every-
body then dispersed quietly to their homes. \Ve
had been led to expect that a sermon in English
would have been preached by an Irish Capucin,
but such was not the case.

Thus ended the commemoration of the Passion
upon Calvary ! and such were the demonstrations
of Christian charity and love, made upon the spot
where Christ died, by His followers—by men who
have devoted their lives to preaching His \Vord
in the city where He ministered—who have ex-
patriated themselves, that they may watch over
and shield from the inﬁdel’s touch the rock which
was sanctiﬁed by His blood, and the tomb made
holy by His body! Oh, what an example to be
given to the Christian world! and—far worse—
what an example to be held up to the Jew and
the Moslem,who, in their most fanatical zeal,never
dreamed of desecrating the tomb of Christ as
His followers have done! I declare to you that
I blushed for the name of Christian, and that it
was with sentiments of mortiﬁcation and humilia-
tion that I quitted the scene of such a disgraceful
riot, and remembered that the only actors in it

who had exhibited good sense, moderation, and
decorum, were the Turks.
