262 SOCIETY.

Monsieur J orelle, the French Consul, who is the
only married man among the European agents at
present here; but a fresh domestic importation
is daily expected in the persons of the newly ap-
pointed English Consul and his wife, whose. ad-
vent is looked for with an anxiety proportioned
to the social paucity experienced here. Monsieur
and Madame Jorelle are kind and amiable peo-
ple, and do all that lies in their power to pro-
mote friendly intercourse. They gave us a
general invitation to their house, where whist is
played every evening; but there is something so
incongruous to me in the idea of a card party in
Jerusalem, and I am besides always so thoroughly
fatigued with my morning rambles by the time
evening approaches, that I have never yet made
my appearance at one of the Consular r√©zmions.
Of all places in the world, Jerusalem appears to
me to be the last in which a temporary sojourner
would seek for society, or feel the want of it;
and I have yet to learn how people can pass the
morning beneath the olive-trees of Gethsemane,
or upon Calvary, and casting aside with their
riding-dress the solemn associations which these

localities call forth, close their evening at the

whist-table.
