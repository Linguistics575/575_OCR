Bedouin camp. Such was the horror which our
martyrdom at Tortura had left upon our minds,
that when we reached Jaff'a on the following
evening, we preferred encamping ourselves out-
side the town, to being again exposed to the
chances of being devoured with vermin. \Ve

the town, surrounded as it is by castellated walls,
extensive gardens, and luxuriant groves of orange-

we have passed, although it has had the advantage
of a recent earthquake (from which it suffered
more than almost any other place in Palestine),
and which has entailed the necessity of some new

buildings being erected in place of the old ones.
