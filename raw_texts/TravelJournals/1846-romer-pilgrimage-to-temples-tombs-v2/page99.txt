86 ASCENT.

the starting point and examining the stepping
stones, I was obliged to relinquish all idea of
it for the time being, and suffered my friends
to ascend without me; while seated near the
base, I watched their upward progress with
something between a feeling of envy at their
superior capability, and one of self-congratula-
tion at being in so much more comfortable a
position than they were,lfor they literally ap-
peared to me as though they would be torn in
two by their conductors. My maid accompanied
them, but such was the fatigue she underwent
in scrambling up the immense stones that form
the irregular steps by which an ascent is effected,
that when she arrived at the place where the
Arabs cry out in very good English, “hay-way I”
she was very urgent to be allowed to wait
there for the return of the party; but in order
to delude her into a continuation of her ven-
turous enterprize, she was told that the descent
was by another side, and that she would have
to ﬁnd her own way back. She was therefore
forced to go on, and at last accomplished the
ascent amidst the screams and cheers of her
three guides; seventeen minutes were exactly

employed in effecting this part of the under-
taking.
