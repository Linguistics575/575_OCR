296 THE SAMARITANS.

any others exist in any part of the known world.
In short, since the Assyrian conquest under
Shalmenezer, when they were led captives to
Babylon, the Samaritans have been a lost nation.
Many attempts have been made to identify them
with populations discovered in various parts of
Asia, and even of America; and some loose
ideas of these researches for their lost brethren
have reached the Samaritans of Nablous, who
boldly asserted to us that there is a large colony
of them in Hindostan; and, what appeared to
us far more incredible, declared with equal con-
ﬁdence that there was a similar establishment
of them in Paris. I cannot help fearing that
these innocent and primitive peOple must have
founded the latter conjecture upon some mauvaz'se
plaz'santerie passed upon them by some travelling
fabricator of that species of joke denominated in
France “ 009 d l’dne :” indeed, so ridiculous did
the assertion appear to me that I should have fan-
cied I must have misunderstood them, (which
might easily have been the case, as my medium
of communication with them was a guide, who
could only mumble a few words of Italian,) had I
not remembered that the Samaritans of Nablous
had made the same declaration to that charming

writer and acute observer, the American traveller,
Stevens.
