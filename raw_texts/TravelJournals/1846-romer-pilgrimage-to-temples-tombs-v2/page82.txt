THE PYRAMIDS. 69

bent upon going all lengths to satisfy an ardent
yet reasonable curiosity. I am not so vain as
to suppose, like Napoleon, that “du haut des
Pyramides quarante siecles me contemplent,” but
if by any chance those venerable centenaz’res
should have perched there, and folded “their
dusky wings” for that purpose, never will they
have contemplated mortiﬁcation more complete
than mine on this occasion, when the weak
ﬂesh has Caused the strong spirit to succumb to
it. Do not expect that at such a moment I
can give you a satisfactory or even a coherent
description of what I have seen; for besides the

’ physical discomfort that attends the mere me-
chanical act of writing as I now am doing, seated
upon a fragment of stone, with my knees for
a desk, the south wind scattering the sands of
the desert over my paper, and drying the words
as fast as I have traced them, my ﬁngers trem-
bling with fatigue and emotion, and a little
black slave holding the inkstand for me and
grinning so prodigiously at my (to him incom-
prehensible) employment. as to divert my atten-
tion every 110w and then to himself, my mind
is in that state of chaotic confusion which pre-
cludes the possibility of anything like connected
details.
