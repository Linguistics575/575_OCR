APPROACH TO DAMASCUS. 339

the ravished sight, plunging down from those
airy heights into the vast and arid plain below,
discovers in the centre of it (to adopt an East-
ern ﬁgure of speech) a sea of emeralds encir-
cling an island of pearls. But, as we drew nearer
to it, some evidences of its extraordinary luxu—
riance of vegetation became apparent. ‘We saw
what appeared to be an immense oasis in the
midst of a desert—an ocean of dark verdure 011
the edge of the horizon; as we approached,
waving groves became distinguishable, and gra-
dually we could perceive minarets rising above
them, and white domes swelling boldly forth
from the clustering shades.

Imagine what a relief for the eye, after tra-
versing that vast sterile plain of the Ghouta
under the glare of a scorching sun, to repose
upon the magniﬁcent mass of groves, and gardens,
and orchards that cover a circumference of thirty
miles surrounding the city. The Barrada, di—
vided into two branches, (the Pharphar and Abana
of Scripture,) waters those matchless plantations.
All the luxury of the East is there,—shade, fra-
grance, coolness; the sweet murmur of rushing
streams; the tender gloom of rustling boughs; the
breeze that languidly fans your cheek, laden with

the perfume of the orange blossom and the rose !
