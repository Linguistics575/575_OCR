MONKISH LEGEND. 219

it is authentic that after the death of her Divine
Son, and in accordance with His dying injunc-
tions uttered from the Cross to her and to “the
Disciple he best loved,” the Mother of Christ
retired to the protection of St. John, and died
in his house at Ephesus, (of which place he was
the ﬁrst Bishop) and was buried there, yet the
monks here assure you that, immediately after
the burial of the Virgin, her body was trans-
ported by angels through the air to Jerusalem,
and deposited in the spot I have just described,
that she might rest in the place where her Son
had died; and that when her tomb at Ephesus
was opened, nothing was found in it but her
grave-clothes folded up, and fresh as though they
had never enveloped the remains of mortality !
And it is by legends such as this that the
monks would add to the sacred interest of the

Holy Land !
