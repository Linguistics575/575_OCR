CELEBRATION OF THE CRUCIFIXION. 267

costume, his snowy fustanella was seen ﬂuttering
in all parts of the church; and the clatter of
his weapons, and those of his followers, upon
the marble pavement, appeared ominously to
sound a warlike alarum, which subsequent events
justiﬁed the Catholics in asserting had been a
pre-concerted signal to the onslaught.

\Vhen we reached the Church, the ceremony
had already commenced. A sermon in Latin
had been preached upon the spot where Jesus
was scourged; a second in French at the place
where He was crowned with thorns; and a
third in German was just terminating at the
Chapel called Imprope-re, where He was spat
upon and buffetted by the soldiers of Pilate;
the efﬁgy of our Saviour borne aloft by a
Franciscan brother, having made a station at
each of those sites, while the discourses were
pronounced. The procession then ascended the
staircase leading to Calvary, and a fourth sta-
tion was made in the Latin Chapel to the right
of the place of Cruciﬁxion, on the spot where
our Lord was nailed to the Cross; and there,
while his “efﬁgy was laid upon the pavement,
and that the ceremony of nailing it to the
Cruciﬁx was enacted, a sermon in Creek was

most impressively pronounced.
