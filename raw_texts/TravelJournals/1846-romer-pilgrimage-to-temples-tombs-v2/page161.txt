148 WAR IN THE LEBANON.

In consequence of the horrid scenes which
became of daily occurrence in the Lebanon,
the Sultan’s government'has again, during the
course of the last year, interfered, and adopted
the more summary process of disarming both
parties, and taking the law into its own hands.
For this purpose Chekib Effendi was sent from
Constantinople to direct the course of affairs,
with power to call in the army of Arabia under
Namik Pasha to enforce his acts. Both of those
ofﬁcials are now in Beyrout, and for the present
tranquillity is restored; but it is the tranquillity
of gunpowder, which is perfectly quiet until the
match is applied to it.

European politics have been kept on the alert
by these measures. Turkey is supposed to be
supported by England in an underhand partiality
for the Druses in the present crisis, while France,
assuming a championlike position for the Maro-
nites, would, apparently, fain take advantage of
the exclusion she was obliged to endure from
the Allied Powers in 1840, by now asserting her
right to act singly in favour of the Christian popu-

no other means of pacifying the Lebanon than
by establishing the ancient Christian Government
