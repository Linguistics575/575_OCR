WAR IN THE LEBANON. 147

signal for the Druses to rise en masse against
their fellow-subjects, the Maronites, and a state
of civil war and horrible carnage ensued, which
became so lamentable that in 1842 the European
Powers interfered, and the Porte undertook the
paciﬁcation of the Lebanon, by giving to each
population local magistrates of their own per-
suasion, and depriving both parties of supremacy.
This plan might have succeeded had all the
villages been conﬁned exclusively to one race!
but some of them have a mixed population of
Maronites and Druses; and to expect that the
Druse magistrates would faithfully and equitably
co-operate with the Maronite authorities would
have been to look for that which never yet has
been found in human nature, when rival interests
and ambitions clash. The consequence was that
fresh discords and massacres ensued, in which
the Druses obtained a complete mastery over
the Maronites, and, it is said, indulged in the
most dreadful excesses; it is also said that they
were encouraged by the Turks, not only from
their hatred of the Maronite Christians, but in
the hope of securing to themselves the alliance of
a powerful and warlike peOple against the Chris—
tian population, who were partizans of, and openly

regretted, the recent domination of the Egyptians.
