of granite, has been broken, and lies
in aruined state near its original site.
The vaulted roof of the hall presents
an astronomical subject, and is richly
ornamented. with a profusion of small
ﬁgures. Indeed all the walls of this
tomb are loaded with very minute
details, but of small proportions.

No. 8. is of king Pthahmen, the
son of Remeses II. On the left side,
entering the passage, is a group, of
very superior sculpture, representing
the king and the Rs.

The style of this tomb resembles that
of No. 17., and others of that epoch;
and in the ﬁrst hall are ﬁgures of the
four nations. The descent is very
rapid, which, as usual, takes off from
that elegance so much admired in
No. 9. ; and the sculptures, executed
in intaglio on the stucco, have suf-
fered much from the damp occasioned
by the torrents, which, when the rain
falls, pour into it with great violence
from a ravine near its mouth. Its
length, exclusive of the open passage
of 40 feet in front, is 167 feet to the
end of the ﬁrst hall, where it is closed
by sand and earth. This was also
one of the seventeen mentioned by
Diodorus.

No. 6. is of Remeses VII. The
sculptures differ widely from those
of the preceding tombs. In the third
passage they refer to the generative
principle. The features of the king
are peculiar, and from the form of
the nose, so very unlike that of the
usual Egyptian face, there is no
doubt that their sculptures actually
oﬁ‘er portraits. On the inner wall of
the last chamber, or hall of the sarco-
phagus, is a ﬁgure of the child Har-
pocrates, seated in a winged globe;
and from being beyond the sarco-
phagus, which was the abode of death,
it appears to refer to the well-known
idea that dissolution was followed by
reproduction into life. The total
length of this tomb is 243 feet, in-
cluding the outer entrance of 25. It
was. cpen during the time of the
Ptolemies.

Sect. IV.

OF THE KING!-

No. 7., which is oppodte this, is of
Remeses II., but is nearly ﬁlled up
with the sand washed into it by the
rains. About 180 feet of it were
cleared, I believe, by Mr. Salt. This
also contains Greek inscriptions.

No. 9. is a small but elegant
tomb, 218 feet long, including the
hypethral passage of 47. The sarco-
phagus remains in its original situ-
ation, though broken at the side, and
is 11 feet 6 inches by 7, and upwards
of 9 feet in height. The bodies
found in the recesses behind this hall
seem to favour the conjecture that
they were intended, like those before
mentioned, in Nos. 11. and 17., as
receptacles for the dead. The in-
scriptions prove it to have been one of
the seventeen open in the time of the
Ptolemies. The name of the king is
Iiemeses IV.

In No. 1. are also Greek inscrip-
tions of the time of the Ptolemies.
It is the catacomb of Remeses IX.,
but very inferior in style and dimen-
sions to the preceding, being only
132 in length, including the exterior
uncovered entrance. A small sarco-
phagus is hewn in the limestone rock,
in the centre of the hall, and covered
witha lid of red granite.

No. 3. is unsculptured, except at
the entrance, which is much defaced.
Its plan is very different from the
other tombs; the total length is
scarcely 123 feet, but its area is
greater than that of No. 1. It was
one of those open at an early period.
The name is of Remeses III.

No. 4. is an unﬁnished tomb of
Remeses VIII. At the end is a
large pit 32 feet deep, 14; in length,
and 11! in breadth. It was also open
during the reigns of the Ptolemies.
Its total length is 807 feet. Neither
of these two are worthy of a visit.

In No. 18. a few faint traces of
sculpture alone remain.

0n the projecting rock s, a few paces
to the east of it, are some hieratic
characters ; and between this and

 

No. 14. it is probable there may be
