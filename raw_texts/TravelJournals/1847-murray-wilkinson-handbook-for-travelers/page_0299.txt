Par‘l'reh lies between two of the nu-
merous high ridges of drifted sand
that extend for many miles, nearly
due N. and 8., parallel to each other.
There is no water after passing Ain
e’ Dthukker, the halting-place of the
ﬁrst day's march.

Though noticed by Arab writers,
the position and even the existence
of the Web e' Dakhleh were unknown
in modern times, until visited by Sir
Archibald Edmonstone in 1819.

The crude brick remains of nu-
merous towns and villages prove it to
have been once a very pepulbus dis-
trict. A little more than 5 miles to the
W. 8. W. of the modern town of El
_l_(asr, is a sandstone temple, called
e’ Dayr el Hagar, “ the stone con-
vent,” the most interesting ruin in
this Oasis. It has the names of Nero
and Titus in the hieroglyphics; and
on the ceiling of the adytum is part
of an astronomical subject. Amun,
Maut, and Khonso, the Theban triad,
were the principal deities; and the
ram-headed Neph and liarpocrates
were among the contemplar gods;
but the Theban Jupiter and Maut
held the post of honour. The
temple consists of a vestibule, with
screens half way up the columns; a
portico, or hall of assembly ; a transept
(if I may so call it) or prosekos; and
the central and two side adyta. lﬁl
feet before the door of the vestibule
is a stone gateway or pylt‘me, the en-
trance to an area measuring 235 feet
by 130, surrounded by a crude brick
well. At the upper or W. end of it
are the remains of stuccoed rooms;
and on the N. E. side are some
columns, covered also with stucco,
and coloured.

There are many crude brick re-
mains in the neighbourhood; and
about one mile and a half from El
l_§asr are the extensive mounds of an
ancient town with a sandstone gate~
way. The fragments oi'stone which
lie scattered about appear to indicate
the site of a temple. now destroyed.

These mounds are about half a

mile square, and below them to the
E. is a spring called Ain el Kat-(d,
whence they have received the name
of Medeeneh Kee‘d. They are also
known as Lémhada. The only ruins
now remaining are of crude brick;
and from the state of their vaulted
rooms, they appear to have been of
Roman time.

El gear and galambon are the
chief towns of the Wah e' Dakhleh.
Th'e shekhs of El Ease call them.
selves of the tribe of Koréysh, and
say that their ancestors, having ml.
grated to this part of the country
about 400 years ago, bought the
springs and lands, which they have
ever since possessed; and the Sb6r-
bsgees of Kalaméon (which is dis.
tant eight miles to the 8.) claim the
honour of havin governed the Cases
from the time of Sultan Selim. This
privilege, however, is now much cur-
tailed; and the governor of Enla-
mbon, reduced to the rank of other
shekhs, can only now be distinguished
by his Turkish dress, his title of
Effendee, and the more dieting“ de.
portment of an Osmanlee. When I
visited this Oasis, Hagee lstna‘ln was
shekh of El liner, and Ghuttas Ef-
fendee was governor of Ealaméon;
from both of whom I experienced the
greatest kindness and hospitality.

About nine miles and three quarters
to the E. of l_(_alam60n is the village
of lsment, where l observed the ca-
pital of a column with an Athor or
lsis head, and near it some crude
brick ruins, called, as usual. e’ Dayr,
“ the Convent." About one mile
and a half to the S. W. is Misarslt.
Ballet is a little more than ten miles
to the E. of lament. On the road,
and about two and a half miles from
the latter village, are the ruins of a
large town, called lsment el Khar‘b,
“ the ruined lsment." The most re-
markable remains there area sandstone
building, measuring nineteen paces
by nine, consisting of two chambers,
in a very dilapidated state; and
another near it, measuring Ive paces
