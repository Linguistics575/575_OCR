srra Alto nescatntort or use nurse-
taoa—Little can be added to the
description given by Strabo of the
monuments of Alexandria; but as it
is Interesting to endeavour to trace
their probable position from the re-
mains and mounds that still exist, or
from other evidence, I shall mention
each singly, and introduce whatever
additional information may be ob-
tained from other writers.

The most remarkable objects at
Alexandria were the Pharos and the
libraries. The former, which was one
of the seven wonders of the would,
was the well-known tower or light-
house. whose name continues to be
applied to similar structures to the
present day. It was a uare build-
ing of white marble, arid is said to
have cost 800 talents, which, if in
Attic money, is about 155.0001. ster-
ling, or double that sum, if computed
by the talent of Alexandria. It was
built by order of Ptolemy Phila-
delphus, whose magnanimity in al.
lowing the name of the architect to
be inscribed upon so great a work,
instead of his own, is highly com-
mended by Pliny. The inscription

for beliering that the name of Ptolemy
was aﬂixed to the Photos, instead of
that of Sostratus, the oniginal inscrip-
tion having been: “ King Ptolemy,
to the Saviour Gods, for the use of
those who travel by sea.” Sostratua,
however, to secure the glory to him-
self in future ages, carved the former
inscription on the stone, and that of
Ptolemy on stucco, which he placed
over it; so that in process of time
when the stucco fell, the only record
was that of the deceitful architect.
The Pharos itself stood on a rock
close to the north-east extremity of
the island of the same name, with
which it communicated by means of
a wall, and the island was also joined
to the shore by a large causeway,
called from its length of seven stades,
the Heptastadieas. It was already
constructed, as Josephus shows, in
the reign of the same Ptolemy, which
therefore implies that it was the work
either of Philadelphus himself, or his
father Soter, and not of Cleopatra, as
Ammianus Marcellinus supposes;
to the lame
princess the erection of the Pharos
itself. These erroneous notions of
the historian may probably have ori-

ran in these words: “ Sostratus of ' ginated in the tradition of some re-
Cnidogthe son of Dexiphanes, to the pairs made by Cleopatra, after the

Saviour Gods, for those who travel by l Alexandrian war.
But, besides the improbebility . was similar to that of Tyre; and
