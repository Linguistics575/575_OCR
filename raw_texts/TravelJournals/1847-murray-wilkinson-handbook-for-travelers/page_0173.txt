The mosh of El Ghoree stands at
the extremity of the butler, called
aﬂer him El Ghoré'e'h, and from its
puitiou is one of the most pictup
reaque buildings in Cairo. On ap-
proaching it by the GhouéEh, which
is of more than ordinary breadth,
you are struck with the effect of its
lofty walls; and the open space in
which it stands, together with the
variety of costumes in the groups who
throng that spot, and the grand door-
way of the tomb on the opposite side.

of an artist. The tomb of El Gh6ree

there are also two other tombs of the

the other on the road to Heltopolis,

the site of what is now the Bazaar of

death of E'Seleh, his Memlooks con-
spired, killed his son, and after the
short reigns of his widow and the
Melclt el Ashraf Moose, who was de-
posed in his 4th year, the ﬁrst Mem-

Selim in IS”. I shall mention them

as might be found in one of our
churches, and therefore differing in
