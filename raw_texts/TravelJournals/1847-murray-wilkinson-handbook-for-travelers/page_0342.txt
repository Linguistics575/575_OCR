neighbouring tombs

There was another road between
the mountains and the Nile, which
passed byan old tovrn now destroyed.
a little beyond Shckh Said, and
thence to Tel el Amirna.

Roads also lead from both those
oldtovms tothe grottoes in the
western face of the mountains; and
others cross the plain in diﬂ'erent
directions. Some of them are of
considerable breadth.

The grottocs have sculptures of a
very peculiar style. The ﬁgures are
similar tothose at Gebel Toona; and
the king and queen, frequently at-
tended by their children, are in like
manner represented praying to the
Sun, whose rays, terminating in
human hands, give them the sign of
life, in token of his accepting the
oﬂ'erings placed before him. It was
by accident that I ﬁrst discovered
these grottoes in 1824, being dis-
tant from the river, and then un-
known to the boatmen of the Nile.
They are very numerous; and their
sculptures are various, and highly in-
teresting. In one the monarch is
borne on a rich throne towards a
temple; in another, he is mounted
in his car, the queen following in
“ the second chariot that he had.”

Some of the sculptures have been
left unﬁnished.

In a small ravine, running nearly
parallel with, and at a little distance
behind, thevrestern faceot'thehills,

ing over the hills in quest of other
grottoes. This it was that induced
me to suppose the town in the plain
below to be Alabastron, though
its position did not agree with
Ptolemy and Pliny.

The grottoes are, as usual, the
tombs of private individuals, who
lived during the reign of the king
whose name occurs within them, and
who are here buried. In one of
them mention is made of an indi-
vidual called Ames, or Amosis, who
was fan-bearer to the monarch.

The royal names, as at Gebel
Toona, have been invariably defaced,
evidently by the Egyptians them-
selves. There are usually ﬁve ovals;
two containing the nomen and pre-
nomen of the king; another the name
of the queen ; and two others, which
are of larger size, have the titles of
the god Atinre, a name applied to
the sun under the form here repre-
