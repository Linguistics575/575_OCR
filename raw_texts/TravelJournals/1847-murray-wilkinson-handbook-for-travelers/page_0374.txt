DESCRIPTION

THEBES.

The name Thebes is corrupted
from the Tape of the ancient Egyp-
tian language, the Tépé of the Copts,
which, in the Memphitic dialect of
Ceptic, is pronounced Thaba, easily
converted into 6118a: or Thebes.
Some writers have conﬁned them-
selves to a closer imitation of the
Egyptian word; and Pliny and Ju-
venal have both adapted Thebe, in
the singular number, as the name of
this city.

In hieroglyphics it is written Ap,
Ape, or with the feminine article Tape,
the meaning of which appears to be
“ the head.” Thebes being the capital
of the country.

Thebes was also called Diospolis
(Magna), which answers to Amunei,
" the abode of Amun," the Egyptian
Jupiter. The city stood partly on
the east, partly on the west of the
Nile, though the name Tépé (Thebes)
was applied to the whole city on
either bank. The western divi-
sion had the distinctive appellation of
Pathyris, or, as Ptolemy writes it,
Tathyris, being under the peculiar
protection of . Athor, who is called
“ the PreSident of the “fest.” For
though Amun was the chief deity
worshipped there, as well as in other
quarters of Diospolis, Athor had a
peculiar claim over the Necropolis
beneath the western mountain, where
she was fabulously reported to receive
the setting sun into her arms.

In the time of the Ptolemies, the
western division of the city, or, “ the
Libyan suburb," was divided into
different quarters, as the Memnonia,
or (Memnoneia); and even the tombs
were portioned off into districts, at-
tached to the quarters of the town.
Thus we ﬁnd that Thynabunum,
where the priests of Osiris were bu-
ried, belonged to and stood within
the limits of the Memnonia. It is

probable that in lats times, when the
city and its territory were divided
into 2 separate nomes, the portion on
the western bank, being under the
protection of Athor, received the
name “ Pathyritic ;” and Thebes
being afterwards broken up into small
villages, ,which was the case even in
Strabo'a time, Pathyris became a dis-
tinct town.

The period of its foundation still
remains, like that of Memphis, the
capital of Lower Egypt, enveloped
in that obscurity which is the fate of
all the most ancient cities: but pro-
bability favours the conjecture, that
though Menes, the ﬁrstlting of Egypt,
found it in the humble condition of
an infant capital, its foundation dated
several generations before the acces-
sion of that monarch to the throne of
his native country. '

Ancient authors do not agree as to
the extent of this city, which, accord-
ing to Strabo, was 80 stadis in length,
while Diodorus allows the circuit to
have been only 140,—a disparity
which may be partially reconciled, by
admitting that it was greatly enlarged
after the time of Menes, to whose
reign the historian alludes. The epi-
thet Hecatompylos, applied to it by
Homer, has generally been supposed
to refer to the 100 gm of its wall
of circuit; but this diﬁiculty is happily
solved by an observation of Diodorus,
that many suppose them “ to have
been the prepylua of the temples,”
and that this metaphorical expression
rather implies a plurality than a de-
ﬁnite number. Were it not so. the
reader might be surprised to learn
that this loo-gated city was never
enclosed by a wall,—a fact fully
proved by the non-existence of the
least vestige of it; for, even allowing
it to have been of crude-brick, it
would, from its great thickness, have
survived the ravages of time, equally
with those of similar materials of the
early epoch of the third Thothmes.
Or, supposing it to have been de-
stroyed by the waters of the inunda-
