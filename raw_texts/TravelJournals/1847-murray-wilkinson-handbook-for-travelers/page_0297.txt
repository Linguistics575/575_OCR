to sacriﬁce what costs them an annual

duty. The trees of the Oasis are
taxed in mass, thoseof the Nile singly;
and whether dead or living, have the
privilege of paying a ﬁxed tax.

They also make treacle from the
dates; and they lay up dried pome-
granates for the winter and spring.

The liquorice roots (soar) ate sent
to the Nile in baskets, and are used
for making a sort of sherbet.

The principal gardens are about El
15W, where fruit trees are abundant,
particularly apricots, pomegranates,
Seville oranges (staring, whence the
Spanish, aamaja, and our “orange),
and vines: they have also the banana,
the new, and mohlmyt (Ithamnus
Nabeca, and Zisyphus), olive, peach,
ﬁg, pear, and some others, among
which l was surprised to ﬁnd one
plum, and 9 or 3 apple trees. Olives
are not abundant; and they are mostly
brought from the Séewah and Fera-
freh.

Though the inhabitants of the Oa-
sis are a much less industrious and
energetic race than the felltilu of
Egypt, they pay considerable atten-
tion to the cultivation of their lands;
but they have not to undergo the same
toil in raising water as on the Nile,
the streams that constantly ﬂow from
plentiful springs atl'ording a conve-
nient and never-failing supply for irri-
gation. But the stagnant lakes cre-
ated by the surplus of water ealule a
pernicious miasma, causing a danger-
ous retnittant fever, which annually
rages in the summer and autumn;
and the Arabs of the desert consider
it unsafe to visit these districts at any
other season than the winter and the
spring.

Whatever theory may be proposed,
or admitted, regarding the origin of
the springs, I am persuaded that this
“'ah is about 200 feet higher than the
Nile in the latitude of Benisoocl'; nor
is the relative height of this and the
other Oasis at all regular; Khargeh
and Dakhlch, which are nearly on the
same level as the valley of the Nile,

being considerably lower than Fara-
l'reh and the Little Oasis. But in all
of them the vrater seems to rise from
an argillaceous bed, which in the two
former lies under limestone, and in the
latter under sandstone strata. It may,
however, be reasonably con ectured
that the water comes origi ly from
the Nile, whence, carried over the
clay, it ﬁnds its way to the diﬂ‘erent
Oases, as to the Natron valley; and
its occasionally rising, in a level higher
than the Nile in the same latitude, is
explained by its having entered the
conducting stratum at some more
southerly, and consequently morn
elevated, part of the river's course.

The tax imposed on the Little
Oasis was in I895 20,0(X) ré'a'la, about
6401. sterling, annually paid to Has-
san Bey Shamashlrgee, to whom this
and the Oasis of Ammon both belong:
and the peace of the district is main-
tained by 400 or 500 armed men, and.
above all. by a line of 900 dollars for
every native killed in a dispute, or on
any other account within its limits,
and double that sum for the murder
of a stranger. It is dilllcttlt to ob-
tain any information respecting the
population of the Oasis; but, from
