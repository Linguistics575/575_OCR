No general‘ extent of this Oan’s can
be 'ven, ovv n to its i ulari ;
andmindeed in 8all of the'ilne8 the c31-
tivable spots bear a very small pro-
portion to the dimensions of the valley
over which they are studded.

f. El Hays. — The small Web of
El Hays is a short day to the south
of this Oasis, of which, indeed, it is a
continuation. it has springs and
cultivated land belonging to the peo-
ple of El Eur and Bowitti, who go
there at certain seasons to till it, and
collect the crops. But it has no vit-
lage, and the only appearance of
buildings is at El Errees, where a
ruined church shows it was once the
abode of Christian monks. This
consists of a nave and aisles, with
rooms on the upper story. Some of
the arches have the horse-shoe form ;
and over a window I observed a
Coptic inscription. About 600 paces
to the south-west is another crude
brick ruin, about 74 paces by 50.
within the walls, which are about 30
feet high, and near this are much
pottery and some nab; trees, which
indicate the previous existence of a
garden, either belonging to a monas-
tery or a town.

9. Fardfrelt. — About 8 days from
El Hays is the Oasis and village of
Farafreh, containing about 60 or 70
male inhabitants. The Kassob,
“ cane," mentioned by Ebn-el-Wer-
dee, appears to be the Dahlia or millet
(Holcus saccharatus), grown in this
district; and it is remarkable that the
name gestalt, usually conﬁned to
sugar-cane, is here applied to millet.
The productions of Farafreh are very
much the same as those of the other
Oasis, but it excels them in the qua-
lity of its olives, which are esported
to the Little Oasis. Fsréfreh was
formerly called Trinytheos Oasis, but
it boasts no remains of antiquity. It
has a castle or stronghold that com—
mands and protects the village in case
of attack from the Arabs, or more
dangerous enemies; and they relate a
melancholy account of a sudden at-

tack from some Blacks of the interior,
many years ago, who killed or carried
oﬁ‘ the greater part of the popula-
tion.

It. Om oftlaeBlacAs.—Fivs or
six days west of the road to Farit'reh
is another Oasis, called Widee Zer-
soéra, about the size of the Oasis
Parva, abounding in palms, with
springs, and some ruins of uncertain
date. It was discovered about 20
years ago by an Arab, while in search
of a stray camel, and from seeing the
footsteps of men and sheep he sup-
posed it to be inhabited. Gebabo,
another Web, lies 6 days beyond this
to the west, and 12 days from An-
gila; and Taserbo, which is still far-
ther to the west, forms part of the
same Oasis. The general belief is
that Widee Zeraéora also communi-
cates with it. The inhabitants are
black, and many of them have been
carried off at different times by the
Moghrebbins for slaves: through
the “ Vallies of the Blacks," a series
of similar Oases lie still farther to the
west.

According to another account,
Zerséors is only two or three days
due W. from Dakhleh, beyond which
is another Wadee; then a second
abounding in cattle; then Gebibo
and Taserbo; and beyond these,
wadee Rebeeana. Gebabo is in-
habited by two tribes of Blacks, the
Simertsyn and Ergezayn.

These are, perhaps, the continuation
of palm-bearing spots mentioned by
Edrisi, extending to Cuca and Ca-
war.

3'. Oasis of Daldtleh. — Four days
to the S. of Farat'reh, is the Wah
e1 Gharbce, or Wah e’ Dakhleh,
“ the Western or Inner Oasis." The
name of Dakhleh is put in Opposition
to Khargeh (which is given to the
Great Oasis that lies E. of it ),—the
one meaning the “receding," the
other the “ projecting ” Wah ; Khar-
geh being called projecting, as being
nearer to Egypt.
