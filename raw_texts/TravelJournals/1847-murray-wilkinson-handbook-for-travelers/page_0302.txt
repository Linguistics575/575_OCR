the Emperor Galha, consists of 66 ]
lines.

The whole length of the temple
measures about 142 feet by 63, and
about 80 feet in height. Attached
to the front of it is a screen, with a
central and two side doorways; and
in the dromos is a succession of pylons.
one before the other, at intervals of
80, 70, and 50 feet. It is the outer
one (which is furthest from the tem-
ple), that bears the inscriptions; and
50 feet before it is an hypathral
building on a raised platform, termi-
nating the dromos, from which there
is ascent to it by a flight of steps.
The temple was enclosed within a
stone wall, abuttin against the in-
nermost pylon. This formed the
terasaos. Near the S. W. corner is
another smaller bypasthral building,
and some distance to the N. of the
temple is a small stone gateway. On
the summit of the second or middle
pylon of the dromos some brickwork
has been raised in later times by the
Arabs; forcibly recalling the addi-
tions made during the middle ages to
many Roman buildings in Italy. The
stone part itself is much higher than
the other two gateways, being about
45 feet to the top of the cornice;
while the other two, the ﬁrst and in—
nermost, are only respectively 15 ft.
7 in. and 20 ft. 3 in. The stones are
well ﬁtted, and have been fastened
together with wooden dovetailed
cramps.

In the vicinity of the temple stood
the ancient town. It bore the name
of Ibis, or in Egyptian, Hebi, “ the
plough,” under which character it is
frequently designated in the hiero-
glyphics with the sign of land, and it
was the capital of the Great Oasis.

On a height, south-east from the
temple, is a stone building called
13' Nadara, surrounded by a spacious
crude-brick enclosure, which bears the
names of Adrian and Antoninus.

To the north is a remarkable
Necropolis, consisting of about 150
crude brick tombs ornamented with

some 18.—camo T0 was oases.

pilasters and niches, not in very pure
s le, but on the whole having a good
e ect. Onthe stuccowithin are re-
presented vsrious subjects, which, as
well as the style of architecture and
the' presence of a Church, decide
that they are of a Christian epoch.
The inscriptions on their walls are
mostly Coptic and Arabic; and the

Iha, the Egyptian
symbol of life, adopted
by these early Chris-
tians, fre quently oc-
curs here in stead of the

cross of their successors.

There are many other ruins in the
vicinity of El Khtirgeh; the others
are in the southern part of this Oasis,
on the road to Bayrées.

The caravans from Dar-Foor to
Egypt pass through the Great Oasis,
on their way to Osioot. Slaves are
also brought this way by Takr6orees,
who are blacks from the interior of
Africa, and Moslems, but are looked
upon as an inferior kind of merchant.
The great and wealthy Jelabs are
from Dar-Four, who sometimes bring
from 2000 to 4000 slaves. The rate
of travelling by the slave caravans is
very slow; they only go from sunrise
to half past 2 or 3 2.31., or about
8 hours’ march; and the journey from
Dar- Foor to Beyrees, at the south of
the Oasis, occupies 31 days; — 10
from Dar-Foor to the Natron plain
called Zeghrawa, 7 to Elegé'éh, 4 to
Scleémeh, 5 to Sheb, and 5 to Bay-
recs.

The population of this Oasis, ac-
cording to the natives, is thus calcu-
lated :—
