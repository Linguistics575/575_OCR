see sufﬁcient reason for supposing

them to represent that event; but,

should this ever prove to be the
case, they will be looked upon with
unbounded interest, and be justly
deemed the most curious painting on
the Egyptian monuments.

The first ﬁgure is an Egyptian
scribe, who presents an account of
their arrival to a person seated, the
owner of the tomb, and one of the
principal ofﬁcers of the king. The
nest, also an Egyptian, ushers them
into his presence; and two advance,
bringing presents, consisting of an
ibea or wild goat, and a gazelle,
the productions of their country, or
caught on the way. Four men, car-
rying bows and clubs, follow, leading
an ass, on which two children are
placed in panniers, accompanied by a
boy and four women ; and last of all,
another ass laden, and two men, one
holding a bow and club, the other a
lyre, which he plays with the piec-
trum. All the men have beards,
contrary to the custom of the Egyp-
tians, but very general in the East at
that period, and noticed as a pecu-

liarity of foreign uncivilised nations
throughout their sculptures. The
men have sandals, the women a sort
of boot reaching to the ancle, both
which were worn by many Asiatic
people, as well as by the Greeks and
the people of Etruria.

One objection to their being the
brethren of Joseph is the number
thirty-seven written over them, ac-
companied by the expression “ cap-
tives." They were in all seventy;
and those presented by Joseph to
Pharaoh were only five. The person
too seated here is not the king. 0n
the other hand, the word " captives "
might only be one of the usual
contemptuous espressions commonly
used by the Egyptians towards
foreigners; and if they were Jews,
the person into whose presence they
were introduced should rather be
Joseph himself than Pharaoh. But
it is a great disappointment to ﬁnd
that his name does not resemble that
mentioned in the Bible, as having
been given to Joseph, “ Zaphnath
Puanenh ; ” and the owner of the tomb
is called in hieroglyphics Nefothph,

 

Nehoth, or Net'hotph, with the names ' nomen, nomen, and titles, in one long

of his father and mother, which are
too distinctly speciﬁed to admit the
claims of Joseph.

The same individual is stated to
have been governor of this part of
the country.

In this tomb is the long hiero-
glyphic inscription before men-
tioned, consisting of 929 lines, re-
lating to the person of the tomb, and
introducing the names of Osirtasen I.
and II. and of the two intervening
ltiugs.

Over the door of the next tomb is
the name of Osirtasen 1., enclosed
together with the royal banner, pre-

 

oval.

Two of the southern grottoes are
particularly worthy of mention. The
ﬁrst of them contains the usual hunt-
ing scene; but here the name of each
animal is written above it in hiero-
glyphics; and below are the birds of
the country, distinguished in like
manner by their Egyptian name. In
one part women are performing feats
of agility; and various modes of
playing at ball, throwing up and
catching three in succession, and
other diversiﬁcations of the game, are
represented amongst their favourite
amusements. In another part is a
