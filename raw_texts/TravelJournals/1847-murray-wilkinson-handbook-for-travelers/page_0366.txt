momson the west, and one on the east
side), immediately before the isolawd
sanctuary, which has a passage lead-
ing round it, and communicating with
three rooms on either side. The total
length of the temple is 93 paces (or
about 220 feet) by 41, or across the
portico, 50. In front of the temple
was the dramas, extending for the
distance of HO paces to an isolated
stone pylon, bearing the names of
Domitian and Traian.

The attributes of Athor at Tentyris
ve much resemble those of Isis;
an she is in like manner represented
nursing a young child, who is said,
in the hieroglyphics, to be her son.
His name was Ehéou, and he is the
third member of the triad of the place,
and the child of Athor, as Harpo-
crates was of Isis.

“ Behind the temple of Venus,"
says Strabo, “is the chapel of Isis ;”
and this observation agrees remark-
ably well with the size and position
of the small temple of that goddess ;
consisting, as it does, merely of one
central and two lateral adyta, and a
transverse chamber or corridor in
front; and it stands immediately be-
hind the south-west angle of that of
Athor. It is in this temple that the
cow is ﬁgured, before which the Se-
poys are said to have prostrated them-
selves, when our Indian army landed
in Egypt. Much has been thought
of this; but the accidental worship
of the same animal in Egypt and
India is not sufﬁcient to prove any
direct connection between the two
religions.

To the temple of Isis belonged
the other pylon, which lies 170 paces
to the eastward, and which, as we
learn from a Greek inscription on
either face of its cornice, was dedi-
cated to that goddess, in the thirty-
ﬁrst year of Caesar (Augustus);
I’ublius Octavius being military go-
vernor, or prefect, and Marcus Clau-
dius Postumus commander-in-chief.

The same is repeated on the east
side of the same gateway.

in the hieroglyphics, besides the
name of Augustus, are those of Clau-
dius and Nero.

Ninety paces to the north of the
great temple of Athor is another
building, consisting of two outer
passage-chambers, with two small
rooms on either side of .the outer-
most one, and a central and two
lateral adyta ,- the whole surrounded,
except the front, by a peristyle of 29
columns. The capitals ornamented,
or disﬁgured, by the representations
of a Typhonisn monster, have led to
the supposition that it was dedicated
to the Evil Genius; but as the whole
of its sculptures refer to the birth of
the young child of Athor, it is evi-
dent that it appertains to the great
temple of that goddess, who is here
styled his mother. It is one of those
buildings which Champollion has
styled the mammeisr’, or “lying-in
places," set apart for the accouclaemest
of the goddess, and where the third
member of the triad, worshipped in
the adjoining temple, was born. The
Typhonian monster is not, therefore,
the deity to whom it was dedicated,
but is only introduced in a subordinate
character, connected with the young
child. The names are of Trajan,
Adrian, and Antoninus Pius.

Around the above-mentioned build-
ings extends a spacious enclosure of
crude brick, about 240 paces square,
