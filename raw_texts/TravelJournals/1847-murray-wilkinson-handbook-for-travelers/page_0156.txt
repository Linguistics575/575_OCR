other furniture may be put into them.

If a house is taken in the kaish
quarter by a bachelor, or one having
no hareém, the neighbours may, as
they frequently do, object to his occu-
pying it; in which case the only re-
medy (besides abandoning it, in the
hopes of ﬁnding other less fastidious
neighbours) is to get some person of
respectability to talk them over, by
representing 'the intended occupant
as a man of good character, who is
not likely to shock their feelings. In
the event of their still objecting, and
the house suiting him well, he may
look out for some liberated black slave
who will act as cook, and who, how-
ever old, may, under the cover of a
Cairene woman’s dress, be denomi-
nated a harsh, without their having
the right to ask any further questions.
It must, however, be observed, that no
native maid-servant is allowed to take
service in the house of a bachelor;
though this is sometimes overlooked
by the shekh ol‘ the quarter, through
particular persuasion, and on the pro-
mise that she shall be a paeperly con.
ducted person, whose conduct shall
notexcite the displeasure of the nei h-
bours; the consequence of the dis-
covery by the police entailing on the
shekh a bastinado, and the same on
the woman herself, as a substitute
for the old custom of putting her into

In buying houses, the price varies
very much in different quarters, and
depends, of course, on their size. In
the Turkish quarters they vary from
5000 to 80,000 piastres. It may be
generally considered that they pay
an annual rent of ﬁve per cent. ; and
a house is thought to be a good bar.
