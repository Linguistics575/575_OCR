Athor was the presiding deity, and
Re(or Mandoo) probably shared the
honours of the place.

About 9 miles to the south-east of
the ruineof Sarﬂhut el Khﬁden‘t are
three tablets cut in the face of the
rock, bearing the names of Thothmes
1V., and another old king: and close
to them are small cares in the lock,
used as tombs.

 

On the lower, or western road, at
Gebel el New. or “ the written
mountain,” the Sinaitic inscriptions
occur in considerable numbers. They
cover the rocks on both sides of the
valley, during great part of a day's
journey, principally on the south side
towards the Gebel. or “ mountain,"
of that name. There are also a few
in Arabic and Greek.

Other Sinaitic inscriptions are
found near the supposed roclt of
Moses; between it and the convent
of the forty martyrs; and again on
the rocks of Mount Catherine; and
someare met with in Wadee Meg-
gub and W. Bank.

At Wadee Maghdro, which runs
from W. Muguttub to the upper
road, are some Sina’itic and hiero-
glyphic inscriptions of early time;
the latter containing the names of Re-

s. mai (4.), who ap.

The word Maghha signiﬁes a “can."

In Wade: Week are other hiero-
glyphic inscriptions, with the names
of early Pharaohs ;

 

and on a sandstone rock in Wadee Ke-
neh is that of a v ancient king, with
the date of his 3 year. (No. 15.)

Vader Fares, which. as Niebuhr
says. has not changed its name since
the days of Moses. is en the western
road to Mount Sinai. it is a sort of
oasis, with high mountains. when a
stream of water ﬂows; which, after
bursting forth and running with rap
pidity for a few hundred yards. is lost
in the sand. Here are several gar-
dens with date treea. claimed by the
Tor Arabs as belonging to them. and
cultivated by some or the Gebeiéiih.
a sort of Arab peasantry, who live
there, and who are the same class of
persons as those above mentioned.
These fondle pay a tribute to the
Arabs in dates.

These inscriptions are of consider»
able importance to theantiquary; but
