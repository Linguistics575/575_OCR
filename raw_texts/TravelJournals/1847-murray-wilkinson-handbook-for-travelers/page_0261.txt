the outer side. In the streets are
several large buildings, whose po-
sitions aremarked by granite columns,
some with capitals of the same kind of
stone, othen of marble, and of the
Corinthian order. They are of R0-
man time, and I suppose that the
main streets had colonnades on either
dds, like those of Antino'é. A short
distance from the extremity of the
“an street is a small column with
spiral ﬂutes; there are also some
houses with vaulted rooms, and others
huiltof burnt brick. of late time; but
the ruins are mostly of the usual crude
brick of Egyptian towns. I found
no sculptures, except on a stone once
belonging to the wall of a temple,
and now the threshold of a shekh’s
tomb, representing a king offering to
a god. 'There are several Corin-
thian capitals lying about, and a block
of Christian time, representing a saint
holding a cross, badly executed, in
the worst village-tombstone style, and
unworthy of a town which held the
rank of an episcopal see. I also
picked up several small objects du-
tin my rambles over these mounds,
ende' ntly of a Roman date.

That Athribis possessed build-
io of olden time is certain, not
on y from the antiquity of the
place, but from a monument found
there, that still may be seen near the
government manufactory of Benita-
el-Assal. it is a granite lion, hear-
ing the name of liemeses the Great,
who did more towards the embellish-
ment of the cities of the Delta than
any other Pharaoh.

To the N. of the town is a double
row of low mounds. resembling the
banks of a canal, or the remains of
walls; but they extend only to a cer-
tain distance, about 2000 feet, and
are closed at the eastern end, so that
they suit neither of these two.

Many of the houses of the town
have been burnt. as is frequently the
case in Egyptian towns; and rte
of the mounds have been u for
tombs, doubtless in after times, when

the limits of the inhabited part were
contracted. They may, therefore,
be referred to a late Roman or Chris-
tian epoch, like those at Bubastis and
other towns; and thus the occurrence
of tombs in the midst of houses, which
is at [inst perplexing, may be ac-
counted for.

The modern village of Atreeh, or
Treeb. is' built at the eastern extreo
mity of the old city, but contains a
very small population. Benha-el-
Assal is about one-third of a mile to
the 8. W., close to the river. It was.
long famous for its honey, whence it
received its name; and this town
supplied part of the present sent by
John Mekaultes, the Coptic governor
of Egypt, to Mohammed, which
consisted of two Copt virgins, one
of whom became his wife, a piece of
ﬁne cloth. a mule, and a jar of honey
from Benhsel-Assol. Beershems now
claims the honour of having this rare
production of Egy pt in the greatest
quantity, and Benha has nothing lea
it but the name.

To the N. of this town is the en-
trance to the Toorat blocs. or Canal
of Noise, which takes the water to
Zalgasee-lt, and thence to the Lake
Mensaleh by the old Tanitic chan-
nel.

Continuing down the Damietta
branch, no place of any great interest
occurs between Athribis and Seben.
