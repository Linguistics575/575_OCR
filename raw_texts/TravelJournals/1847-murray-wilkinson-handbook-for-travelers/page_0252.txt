The road then continues at some
distance from, and nearly parallel
with, the sea, till it passes on the
tight the mountain of Hammam
Phat-soon, “ the baths of Pharaoh,”
which projects into the sea about 45

eographical miles to the 8. S. E. of
ﬁnes. This mountain is so called
from the hot springs thatrise at its
foot on the sea-shore; and a fanciful
tradition of the Arabs has named it
after the Egyptian kin , as a memo-
rial of the passage of Israelites.
The temperature of the largest spring
is about 157° Fahr., and the water is
strongly impregnated with sulphur
and common salt. They lie some
distance out of the road, and to visit
them is a «lilo-r of several miles.
The direct road from Wadee Ghurun-
del, after having passed to the east of
this mountain, takes a curve more in.

oing to Mount Sinai by Wadee
glumr and Sal-abut el Khédem to
the left, the other by Wadee Mu-
ltuttub, and Wadee Faran to the right,
which may be called the lower road.

At Nusb, or Nasbeh, a short dis-
tance off the road to the right, about
4 miles before reaching Sarﬁbnt cl
Khadem, are ancient copper works,
and many inscriptions in what has
been called the Sinaitic character,
from having been considered peculiar
to the desert of Mount Sinai. They
do not however belong exclusively to
that part of the country, as I found
them on the rocks near the sea at Ge-
bel Aboo Durrag on the Egyptian
side of the Arabian Gulf, and others
have been met with in the interior, at
Wadee Dthahal, as well as at e’ Gim-
sheh, and, as I have been told by Mr.
Burton,in the grottoes of Wadee 0m-
Dthummerﬂna. Their long-wished-
for interpretation is said to have been
lately accomplished, and they are
found to be of Christian time.

The only ruins at Nisbeh are some
small stone houses, probably miners’

for its numerous hierogl phic tablets,
of very ancient date, an for the pe-
culiar appearance of the place. It is
a rocky eminence about i of an hour's
walk from the road, on a range of
sandstone hills, with a footpath on
one side, leading to its extensive ﬂat
summit, at one end of which is a con-
fused mass of ruins and many tablets,
some fallen, some standing erect,
covered with hieroglyphics, which
from their containing the names of
very early Pharaohs are worthy the
attention of the Egyptian antiquary.
A plan of the ruins here is much
wanted.

Besides the numerous tablets with-
in the building, are others on the
outside, and some at a distance of
half a mile from the entrance. They
hear the names of various Pharaohs,
among which are Osirtasen I. -—the
queen of the obelisk at Kar-
nak,——Thothmes III. and IV.,-—
and Amunoph I. and III.,-— Osirei
and his son Remeses the Great, —
Osirei III.,-- Remeses IV. and V.,
and some others.
