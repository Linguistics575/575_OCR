siderable sise, with the usual bazaar,
and the comfort of a pretty good
bath. There is a market day every
Sunday, which, though apparently
very uninteresting, I mention, because
meat and other things are then more
easily obtained than at other times.
It has a governor’s palace, and out-
side the walls are several gardens.

There is reason to believe that an
old Egyptian town stood here in for-
mer times, and Leo Africanus speaks
of its sculptured remains, and the
ruins of a building, apparently a
temple, near the river.

It is singular that no notice is
taken of it by Greek and Latin
writers, and we might suppose that
the Arab geographer was incorrect
in his statement, did not its mounds,
and the mention of its name in the
list of places cited in the Captic MSS.
prove it to have been one of the
cities of ancient Egypt. Its modern
name is evidently taken from the
Coptic, which M. Champolliun sup-
poses to signify the “ place of wild
asses ;" but the modem Egyptians,
with their usual disposition to con-
nect every thing with persons men-
tioned in the Koran, have decided it
to be the “place of exile of Lot."
Abooll'eda describes Manfaloot “ on
the bank of the Nile," but in P0-
cocke‘s time it stood a mile from the
river, which then ran nearer the hills
of Gebel Abool'ayda. Since that
period it has gradually encroached on
the western shore. It had also a
“bishop and about 200 Christians,
whose church was at Narach, some dis-
tance off, in a spot where the common
people pretended that the Holy Family
lived until the death of Herod.” Ac-
cording to Mr. Jowitt, who visited
Egypt about 90 years after him, the
number of Christians in Manfaloot
amounted to about 50, and 18 priests,
without reckoning those in the con-
vents in the vicinity.

Manfaloot is now nearly all carried
away by the Nile, which runs over the
spot where the principal part of the

to believe that in a few years the
whole will be destroyed.

Beni Adee or Bani Ali, at the edge
of the Libyan desert, is well known
as having been the head-quarters of
the Nisam, or discliplined troopsof
the Pasha, previous to their march for
the Morea; and as the usual point
of departure for the Oasis of D‘kh-
leh. (See Route 18. Sect. II.)

In Wadee Boos, at the southern
corner of Gebel Aboofayda on the
E. bank, and near the mouth of
Wadee e‘ Gibréwee, are some old
grottoes. In one of the latter is some
sculpture much defaced, representin
the usual agricultural scenes foung
in the tombs. They have been oc-
cupied in later times by the Christians,
who probably put up the Greek in-
scription I observed in a niche; and
which might possibly be deciphered,
if the sun were higher than when
I saw it. Just below are old ruined
villages. Some place H ieracon near
this spot. It is here that the road
from Tel el Amarna over Gebel
Abooféyda rejoins the valley of the
Nile, and those travelling by land
avoid a great détostr by following
this mountain pass.

About 6 miles beyond, near the
edge of the cultivated land, behind
Benéob pl Haunam, are vestiges of
the Gisr-el-Agoos. In the tract of
land on the border of the desert, near
the road going towards El Waste, I
found a crude brick ruin and the
mounds of other small towns, but
without any stone remains. Isium

The Nile makes several large bends
between Manfaloot and Osioot, which
often cause considerable delay. At
the end of one of them, and at a short
distance from the bank, is Mankabat,
or Mungabat, the successor of an old
town called in Coptic Mankapot,
