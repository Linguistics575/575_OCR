Inlandtothewest is ammo
ancient Osyrhinchus, in Coptic
Pemge, which is a ride of 1 miles
acroesthe ﬁelds, from Abno- irgeh.
The peculiar worship of the Oxyrhin-
chus ﬁsh gave rise to the Greek name
of this city; end, from the form of its
“ pointed nose,” I am inclined to
think it was the Mind or Misdeh of
the present day, which may be traced
in the Coptic range. The modern
name of the place is Bahnasa or
Béhnesa, in which some have endea-
voured to trace that of the Beaai, one
of the many ﬁsh of the Nile, con-
veniently transformed into theoa yrhin-
chus for an etymological purpose, and,
it is needless to say, without the least
shadow of reason.

The position of Béhnesa is far from
being advantageous; the Libyan desert
having made greater encroachmente
there than in any part of the valley.
Downs of sand overgrown with bushes
extend along the edge of its culti-
vated land ; to the west of which is a
sandy plain of great extent, with a
gentle ascent. towards the hills of the
Libyan chain; and behind these is a
dreary desert. The encroachments
are not, however, so great as Denon
would lead us to suppose, nor will the
peeple oi' Béhnesa, as he supposes, be
driven by the sand beyond the Bahr
Yoosel'. The site of the town
guarantees the inhabitants from such
a catastrophe, even if they neglect the
most common precautions, and they
have always the means of protecting
themselves from it, though the invap
sion of sand were to increase by more
than its usual ratio.

On the south side are some mounds
covered with sand, on which stand
several shelths‘ tombs; and others,

town, whose importance is proved by
the many granite columns, fragments

lie scattered about. Little, however,
remains of its early monuments; and

Like other towns Behnesa boasts a
patron saint. He is called e’ Tak-
roory, and is known in Arab songs
and legendary tales. He is even be-
lieved to appear occasionally to the
elect, outside his tomb, accompanied
by a numerous retinne of horsemen,
but without any ostensible object.

of the composite order,“ described by
Denon, no longer exists, though the
columns he mentions in the mocks
may still be seen. According to an
account given me in the Fyodm, aher
my visit to Behnesa, there are some
caverns to the N. W.(?) of the town,
and in one of them about eighteen
columns arranged around the interior
and standing in water, which is 0}
great depth, and never dried up.
Nearly opposite the door is a niche or
recess, once (as they pretend) the
site of an alter or a status.

the authority of the Arabs may
doubted, any one who visits Béhneea
may easily inquire about it, and as-
certain the truth.

Behneaa is still the residencs of a

the principal towns of modern Egypt.
