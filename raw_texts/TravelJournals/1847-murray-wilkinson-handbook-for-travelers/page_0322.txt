The account of this conquest and of
the previous history of the city, given
by the Arab historian Aboo Ab-
dillshi ban Mohammed el Mulghari,
is more like fable than a real his-
tory.

Above Aboo-Girgeh are e1 gays,
Aboa- Asees, and other places, whose
mounds mark the positions of old
towns. El gays, the Kais of the

rhinchus, is the ancient_Cynopolis, the
“ City of the Dogs ; " and itis worthy
of remails, that one of the principal
repositories of dog mummies is found
on the opposite bank, in the vicinity
of Hamstha. It was not unusual
for a city to bury its dead, as well as
its sacred animals, on the opposite side
of the Nile; provided the mountains
were near ’the river, or a more con-
venient spot oﬂ‘ered itself for the con-
struction of catacombs than in their
own vicinity; and such appears to
have been the case in this instance.
There is reason to believe that one
branch of the Nile has been stopped
in this spot, which once ﬂowed to the
west of el Keys; and this would ac-
cord with the position of Cynopolis,
in an island, according to Ptolemy,
and account for the statement of el
Mulggari that el gays was on the
east bank. Co, which Ptolemy places
apposite Cynopolis, should be some
miles inland to the west. Beni-
Mohammed-el-Kofoér has succeeded
to the old Nikafar mentioned in the
Captic M83. It was above Kais;
but another town, called Tamma, is
placed by them between CynOpolis
and Oxyrhinchus.

In the hills behind Shelli Hanan,
on the east bank, are extensive lime-
stone quarries. Near them are some

crude brick remains, with broken
pottery; and in a chapel or niche in
the rock is a Christian inscri tion.
A singular isolated rock stands m the
plain behind Neslet e' Shekh Has-
san; and similar solitary masses of
rock, left by the stone-cutters, are
met with to the south, with other
quarries, and a few small tombs.
About two and a half miles to the
south of Neslet e’ Shelth Hassan are
the vestiges of an ancient village ; and
in the plain, near the mouth of the
Wadee e’ Seraré'e’h, arean old station,
or fort, and another village. The
river here makes a considerable bend
to the west, leavin two large islands
on the eastern si e opposite Golé-
saneh. Near the latter village Po-
cocke saw two rows of stone-about
90 feet long, under the water, ap-
parently the remains of an ancient
wall; but I could ﬁnd no traces of
them, though it is possible that at the
low Nile they may still be discernible,
and Golosaneh may occupy the site
of an old town.

0n the north-west corner of the
bills, at the mouth of Wadee e‘ Dayr,
are some limestone quarries. Their
principal interest always consisted in
two painted grottoes of the early time
of Pthahmen, the son of Remeses the
Great, the last Icing of the 18th dy-
nasty. One of them has unfortu-
nately been destroyed by the Turks,
and the other has already lost its
portico, and is threatened with the
fate of its companion. It is very
small, measuring only 7 paces by 4,
inside, but very interestin from the
subjects it contains, an from the
fact of its having been the rock
temple, or chapel, of the adjoining
quarries. The portico was in anti:
with two columns, one of which was
standing two or three years ago; and
it received the name of Babéyn, “the
two doors," from its double entrance.
Athor was the presiding deity.
