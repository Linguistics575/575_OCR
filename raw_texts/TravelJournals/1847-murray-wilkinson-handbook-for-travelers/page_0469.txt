to such an extent as to give up their l

to us no leasestraordinary than to I
the historian who relates it; but it is
worthy of remark, that a very similar
custom still continues in Ethiopia; i
and the expedition sent by Moham- ‘
med Ali, to trace the course and dis-
cover the sources of the Bohr d Abiod,
or White Nile, founda triheof Ethio-
pians on its banks, whose kings, when .
they feel the approach of death, give
notice to their ministers, and are
strangled to prevent their dying in the
ordinary vulgar way of nature, like the
meanestof their subjects. The same I
espedition also found that a corps of '

With regard to the two streams
ofthe Nile, I may observe that the
‘ Bahr el Asrek, though smaller than
the Abisd, may be considered the
real Nile, from its having all the
character of that river, in its alluvial
deposit, and other features; and that
it is improperly called by us “ blue " .
river, card really signifying “ black.”
“'hen the Arabs wish to say “ dark "
or “jet black,” they use Asrck, '
“blue” (black), and it is evidently
here put in opposition to nbiad,
“ white.”

added. The oval of Augustus like-
wise occurs in the portico, but a great
part of this buildin was left und-

the case with the Roman and Ptole-

A large plan of this temple has
been given by M. Gan, in which an
endless succession of chambers is laid
down around the principal building.
But without wishing to detract from
the honours paid by the Egyptians to
Hermes ' ' us, or from the
merits of the valuable nork of M.
Gan, it may be doubted whether any
authority esists for such complicated
details, and the magniﬁed sise of the
original building.
