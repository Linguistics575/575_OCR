rude beaten path, leading to what
appears to have been the abode of a
hermit. Pococke calls the spot Ain-
elaham, and supposes the well or
spring there to be the only one whose
mater does not come from the Nile.
He also mentions several grottoes to
the west of the village of El Gour-
ney, some of which, in his time,
retained traces of ancient paintings.
The valley he alludes to is doubtless
the Wadee el Ain (“valley of the
spring”), between three and four
‘ miles to the N. E. 'of Ekhmim,
in which are a spring of water and
grottoes, and on the south of its
month an old road leading over the
mountains. Close to this is a mo-
dern pass called Nukb el Kélee,
which crosses the mountains, and
descends again into the valley, in the
district of Sherg Weled Yﬁhia, nearly
opposite Bardées.

Behind the village of Howaweesh
are other grottoes; and three miles
above Ekhmim, are the vestiges of
an ancient town, probably Thomu.
The remains there consist of mounds
and crude-brick.

Thomu should be the place called
in Coptic Thmoui m Panehéou ; but
M. Champollion endeavours to show
from a Copt MS. that it was an
island on the western side of the Nile,
opposite Elthmim; and its name,
“ the island of the place of cattle,”
argues that it was not on the main
land, if even it could be to the east
of Panopolis. Thomu, however, is
placed by the Itinerary on the east
bank, four miles above Panopolis,
and therefore agrees with the position
of these mounds.

Some other places are mentioned
in the Coptic MSS. as having existed
in the vicinity of Ekhmim; but of
their exact position nothing is satis-
factorily known. These are Pleuit,
Shenalolét, and Tsmine, the ﬁrst of
which appears to have been an an-
cient town of some consequence; the
second, from its name, a village with
many vineyards in its neighbourhood;

and in the last was a monastery

Measles} has extensive mounds,
but the only vestiges of masonry eon-
sist in a stone quay, on the east side
of the town. it stands on a small
branch of the Nile, which was pro-
bably once the main stream. By the
Copts it is called Psoi, and some-
times in Arabic M88. El Monshat, as
well as Menshé'e'h. It is supposed to
occupy the site of Ptolemais Hermii;
which, according to Strabo, was the
largest town in the Theba'id, and not
inferior to Memphis. But neither its
original extent, nor that of any city
in Upper Egypt, except Thebes
itself, can justify this assertion of the
geographer. He even gives it a po-
litical system, on the Greek model;
which, if true, may refer to some
change in its government, after it had
beeil rebuilt, and had received the
name of Ptolema’is ; for it doubtless
succeeded to a more ancient city. and
Ptolemy calls it the capital of the
Thinite nome. Leo Africanus says
it was “ badly built, with narrow
streets, and so dusty in summer, that
no one could walk out on a windy
day. The neighbourhood, however,
was famous for abundance of corn
and cattle. It was once possessed by
a certain African prince from the
Barbary coast, called Howéra, whose
predecessors obtained the principality
of that name, of which they were
deprived within our recollection by
Soliman, the ninth Sultan of the
Turks."

extremity of the mountain, apposite

mile above Lahéiwa.

Geergelt, or Girgela, in Pococke’s
time the capital of Upper Egypt,
still claims, from its extent and popu-
lation, the second rank, after Osioot;
but it has not succeeded to any an-
cient town of note, and from its name
it is easy to perceive that it is of
Christian origin. When visited by
