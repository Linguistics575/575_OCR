The town of El Khﬁrgeh stands
about 13 miles from the hills that
bound this Oasis to the east, over
which thevariousroadsleadto the
Nile. The length of the central
plain. in which it stands. extends in a
direct line N. and 8. about 66 miles,
glut part of which is desert, with
cultivable spots here and there, which
depend on the pretence of springs.

The productions of the Web El
Khargeh are very much the same as
those of the Little Oasis; with the
addition of the Theban palm, much
wild senna. and a few other plants;
but it is inferior in point of fertility.
The number offruit trees is also much

The Cases are little noticed by
ancient writers, except as places of ex-
ile, which ill accord with the fanciful
name of “Islands of the blessed."
given them by Herodotus; who adds
another extraordinary assertion that
the great Oasis was inhabited by
ﬂamians of the :‘Eschrionian tribe.
Through it the army of Cambyses is
said so have passed, when going to
attack the Ammonians; and it wasin
the desert, about half-way between
this and Séewah, that the Per.
sians perished. One of the most re-
markable persons banished to this
place, was Nestorius, who was con-
demned by the council of Ephesus,
and was at length sent to the Great
Oasis in 435 a. n.
