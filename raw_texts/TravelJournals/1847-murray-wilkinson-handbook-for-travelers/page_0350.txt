or Acacia Nilodca. grows near Mot-
mir, which. like that on the road to
Abydus. may be the remnant of
one of the old groves of Aeanthus.
At the north of the projecting corner
of the mountain, behind Motmar, is
a road called Detb Imow, which
crosses this part of the eastern chain
of hills, and rejoins the valley of the
Nile by a ravine near the grottoes of
cow; and another, called Nulgb el
Hossayn, leads from a little above
Dayr Iasm and descends at the cor-
ner of the same mountain ashort way
to the west of the same grottoes.

A little beyond Motmﬁr is Sherg
Belin. It has no ruins, but, from its
name, it seems to lay claim to the
site of Selinon, though the Itinerary
places Selinon half way between An-
teopolis and Panopolis. Perhaps,
in this place, we should read Pas-
salon for Selinon.

I have heard that in a grotto here
is the name of one of the foreign
kings, who were cotemporaries of the
18th dynasty.

At El Khowﬁbid are some mounds,
but no ruins; and in the hills to the
north-east are some limestone quar-
ries. About a mile further to the
south-east are some grottoes, at the
projecting corner of the hills, and
others behind the Dayr Iassa.

Civitas, to distinguish it from Apolli-
nopolis Magus and Pans, now Edfoo
and £005. On the east bank. a little
below Gow el Kebeér. are several
grouse: at the projecting corner of
the mountain, which there curves
inward to the east. Many of them
are the wank of the Romans, or have
been occupied and painted by them,
being ornamented with arabesques
and devices of a late time. Near
them are some crude brick remains.
Gore, or 5010, El Kebeé'r, in Coptic
Tltbou, the ancient Antaapolis, stands
on the east bank. The remains of
the temple of Antteus are new con-
ﬁned to a confused mass of stones
near the water’s edge, one of which
bears the hieroglyphic names of
Ptolemy Philopator and his queen
Arsinu'é. The last remaining co-
lumn of the temple, mentioned by
Dr. Richardson, was carried away
by the river in 1821, which Mr. Legh
says, as early as 1813, threatened
“ to wash the whole away." At the
time he visited it, the portico was
still standing, and much in the same
state as when seen by Norden and
Pococlte in 1737. Mr. Hamilton
found the Greek inscription on the
