Atfeh is a miserable village, abou nd-
lng in dust and dogs; but the ﬁrst
view of the Nile is striking, and a
relief after the canal.

The voyage between Atfeh and
Cairo (or Boolak) occupies about 3
or 4 days, in ascending the stream
with a good wind; or by the steamer
about 22 hours, and 1! to 12 in
coming down the stream to Atfeh.

During the high Nile, the voyage
to Cairo takes rather more time.

Feath— Nearly opposite Atfeh is
Focal, conspicuous with its minarets,
and a picturesque object from the
river, as you pass during the high
Nile. it occupies the site of the
ancient Metelis (in Coptic Meleg, or
Meledg), but contains no remains
beyond a few granite blocks, now
used as the thresholds of doors, with
hieroglyphic insctiptions, containing
the names of Apties and other kings
of the 26th or Sa'ite dynasty. Fooah
has now only a tnsnufactory of tar-
booslaes or red caps, and the usual
tct‘rshclt “ manufactory " of large
towns; but in the time of Leo
Africanus it was very ﬂourishing;
and though its streets were narrow,
it had the character of a large town,
teeming with plenty, and noted for
the appearance of its bazaars and
shops. “ The women," he adds,
“ enjoy so much freedom there, that
their husbands permit them to go
during the day wherever they please;
and the surrounding country abounds
in date trees."

The best Egyptian dates come from
a place on the other side of the Delta,
called Korayn, near Selahé‘e’h, which
are known at Cairo as the advance.
The lbreemee are from Nubia.

Fooah has given its name to the

quest of Sultan Selim, as second only
to Cairo.

During the wars of the Crusaders,
the Christians penetrated into E t
as far as Fooah, in the reign of Millie];
Adel ; and having plundered and burnt
the town, retired with much booty.

Dessodh is well known in modern
times tor the ”to celebrated there in
honour of Shekh Ibrahim e' Des-
sookee, a Moslem saint, who holds
the second rank in the Egyptian ca-
lendar, next to the Bay'd el Beddowee
of Tanta.

At e’ Hawaii} was the entrance
of an old canal that went to Alex-
andria; which some suppose to be the
ancient Can0pic branch, placing Nau-
cratis at this town. E' Rahmané‘dl
was a fattiﬁed post of the French
when in Egypt, and was taken by
the English in May 1801, previous
to their march upon Cairo.

Sal's. — The lofty mounds of Sais
are seen to the N. of the village of
Sa-el-Hagar, “ S: of the Stone," so
called from the remains of the old
town; which are now conﬁned to a
few broken blocks, some ruins of
houses, and a large enclosure, sur-
rounded by massive crude brick walk.
These last are about 70 feet thick,
and of very solid construction. Be-
tween the courses of bricks are layers
of reeds, intended to serve as binders;
and l have been assured that hiero-
glyphics have been met with on some
of the bricks, which may perhaps,
contain the name of the place, or of
the king by whom the walls were
built. I cannot, however, atlirm that
this is really the case, not having
been able to and them myself. but
others may be more fortunate in their
search.

The” walls enclose a space mea-
suring 2825 feet by l960; the north
side of which is occupied by the lake
mentioned by Herodotus, where cer.
tain mysterious ceremonies were per.
formed in honour of Osiris. As he
says it was of circqu form, and it is
