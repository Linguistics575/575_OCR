The details of the cornice of the
portico oﬂ‘er a very satisfactory speci-
men of the use of a triglyphic orna-
ment. It is common in many of the
oldest Pharaonic temples, though ar-
ranged in a somewhat different man-
ner, and without so remarkable a me-
tope as in the present instance.

0n the frieze, or rather srchitrave,
is a procession to Athor; and among
the figures that compose it are two
playing the harp, and another the
tambourine.

The inscription is on the projecting
ﬁllet of the cornice, and commences
with the name of the Emperor Tibe-
rius. Those of Aulus Avillius Flac-
cus, the military governor, or prefect,
and Aulus Fulmius (or Fairies)
Cnispus, commander of the forces (or
commander-in-chief), though pur-
posely erased, may still be traced,
when the sun strikes obliquely on the
surface of the stone. The date of the
Emperor's reign (restored by M.
Letronne) is the 21st of Tiberius,
(the 21st of the Egyptian month
Athor); and the whole inscription is
as follows :—

has been removed to France; and
from its position it probably dated a
few years before the aodiac.

Numerous are the names of Cesare
in this temple. In the portico may
be distinguished those of Tiberius,
Caligula, Claudius, and Nero. 0n
the former front of the temple, now
the backof the pronoun, or portico,
are those of Augustus and Caligula.
This was, in fact, the original extent
of the building, and it was previous to
the addition of the portico that it was
seen by Strabo. The oldest names
are of Ptolemy Cnsarion, or Neo-
Casar, son of the celebrated Cleo-
patra by Julius Cesar, and of his
mother; who are represented on the
back wall of the exterior. Neither
her features (which may still be
traced)nor her ﬁgure correspond with
her renowned beauty. But the por-
trait is interesting, from being the
contemporary representation of so
celebrated a person; and however
badly executed, probably been some
sort of general resemblance to the
original; allowance being made for
the Egyptian mode of drawing, and
the want of sltill of the artist, who
probably never saw the queen, and
copied her portrait from some other
imperfect picture. It appears that
the whole none was the work of
the Ptolemies, though the sculptures
remained unﬁnished till the reign of
Tiberius, who, havin erected the
portico, added many 0 the hierogly-
phics on the exterior walls. Indeed,
some of the royal ovals in the interior
continue black to this day.

lumns, and is open at the front. shove
