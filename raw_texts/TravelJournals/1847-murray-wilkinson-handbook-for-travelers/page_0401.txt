covered up and concealed from view ;
but it will be well if they thus escape
the Turkish miners.

The granite pylon at the upper ea-
tremity of the inclined ascent bore,
like the rest of the building, the
name of the founder. Amunneitgori;
which, in spite of the architectural
usurpations of the third Thothmes, is
still traced in the ovals of the jamhs
and lintel. Nor is it from the ap-
pearance of the ovals alone that we
are enabled to restore this, as well as
the rest of the temple, to its original
founder; the very sense of the mere-
glyphics would remove all doubts, if
any existed. regarding this fact. from
the singular circumstance of the fe-
male signs being used throughout
them. so manifestly at variance with
the name of this kin . Forinstance,
on the jamb, we rea after the name
of Thothmes ill. (but still preceded
by the square title, banner, or es-
cutcheon of Pharaoh Amunneitgori),
“ She has made this work for Iter- fa-
ther ‘ Amunre, lord of the regions’
(6. s. of Upper and Lower Egypt);
she has erected to him this ﬁne gate-
way.-‘ Amun protects'the work, ——of

nite ; she has done this (to whom)
ltfe is given for ever."

Beyond this pylon, following the
same line of direction, is a small area
of a later epoch, and another granite
pylon, being the entrance of a large
chamber to which it is attached.
This, as well as the facade on either
side. presented the name of Amun-
neitgori. erased to admit those of
Thothmes ll. and "L; and inother
chambers to the west and within the
court between the two pylons, the
same name has sulfa-red a similar out-
rage. That of 'l‘hothmes i. also ap.
rears among the sculptures; but as he
a stated to have been "deceased," at
the time ofits insertion, he must have
been a predecessor of the founder of
the building.

Egyptians were not, however, i

arch, as I have had occasion to ob-
serve; andthereasonot‘theirpre-
ferring one of this construction pro-
bably arose from the diﬂculty of re-
pairing an injured vault in the tun-
nelled rock, and the consequences
attending the decay of a single block.
Nor can any one in observi the
great superincumbent weight applied
to the hunches suppose that this
style of building is devoid of strength,
and of the usual durability of an
Egy tian fabric. or pronounce it to
be il «suited to the purpose for which
it was erected, the support of the
friable rock of the mountain, within
whose excavated base it stood, and
which threatened to let fall its crumb-
ling masses on its summit.

The entrance to these vaulted
chambers is by a granite doorway;
and the ﬁrst, which measures 30 feet
by 12, is ornamented with sculp-
tures that throw great light on the
names of some of the members of
the Thothmes family. Here Thoth-
mes l. and his queen Antes, accom-
panied by their young daughter, but
all “deceased“ at the time of its con-
s:ruction. receive the adoration and
oﬂ’etings of Amunneitgorl, and of
Thothmes ”I. followed by his
daughter, ile-ni-nofre. The niche
and inner door also present the name
of the former, edited by the same
'l‘hothmcs, whose name throughout
the interior usurps the place of his
predecessor's. To this succeeds a
smaller apartment, which. like the
two lateral rooms with which it com-
municates, has a vaulted roof; and
beyond is an adytum of the late data
of Ptolemy Physcon.
