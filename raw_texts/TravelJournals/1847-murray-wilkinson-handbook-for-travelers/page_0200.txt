Some only of the above-mentioned
twelve onders exist in Egypt: as,

l. The Mowlowé'éh, whose college
or togéea is at the Seleébeh, near the
Seeoofé'éh. They are whirling der-
wishes.

9. The Rufaé'éh, who have a col-
lege in the Soog o’ Silléh, opposite
the mosh of Sultan Hassan.

3. The Bilttashé'éh, whose college
is at the Maghéra, near the fort be-
hind the citadel of Cairo.

4. The Siidé'éh, in many parts of
the city. They perform the ceremo-
nies at the ddseh, on the last day of
the Prophet’s festival, tearing snakes
to pieces, and doing other strange
feats.

5. The Eudré‘e’h, who have colleges
in many parts of Cairo, besides that
of Old Cairo already mentioned.

6. The Beddowé'e'h, who have also
many colleges. It is this order which
performs the ceremonies at the Mooled
e' Nebbee, or “ Prophet's birth-day,"
held in the Usbeké'e'h, in the begin-
ning of the month of Rebééh el owel;
those of the last day (Friday) alone
being committed to the St'iidé'éh.

7. The Byooméﬁh, whose principal
college is in the Hossayné'éh. They
are distinguished by long hair.

Marriage is not forbidden to the
derwishes, unless they have once taken
the vow of celibacy, when they are
called Megtirrud, and are expected
to lead an austere and exemplary
life.

The derwishes are distinguished by
their high caps, the large amulet they

wear. generally of agate, and a pecu-
liar dreas, at least when belonging to
a college of their order; but others
bear no external mark, and are only
known to each other, like freemasons,
by certain secret signs.

At the Mooled el Hassanin, all the
derwishes of Cairo perform rib-s, on a
pmticulsr day assigned to each sect,
except the Mowlowé’e'h, who are only
permitted by their rules to celebrate
this strange ceremony within the walls
of their own college. One or two in-
dividuals may, however, assist at the
ﬁre, and whirl round, as is their cus-
tom, but without the pipes, dam“.
and other concomitants, which, in the
zihrs within their own college, are a
necessary part of the performance.
In turning, they always hold the
right hand with the palm upwards and
the left downwards; the reason of
which is, doubtless, as full of religious
wisdom as their laying the spoon up-
side down after eating, and other
mysterious customs. In their zt'kr,
all those who are present whirl round
at the same time, the shelth alone
standing still; and such is the merit
of the union of many, on this occa-
sion, that unless four are present,
the ceremony cannot be performed.

The dancing derwishes are said not
to exist in Egypt, but the Rufaéiih
and Siidé'éh have nearly the same
kind of gesture; and the Nuksh-
bandé'e'h dance together in a circle.

The college of derwishes at Old
Cairo originally belonged to the Biltta-
shé’éh, having been founded by one of
that order; but the shelth having
died, and the college standing on
ground claimed by Ibrahim Pasha,
the latter transferred it to one of the
Kudré'éh, who had accompanied him
fl om the Morea ; and thus this order
came into possession of a college pro-
perly belonging to another sect.
Whether this grant was according to
justice or no I know not; but pre-
judice and fancy were not long in dis-
covering a direct proof of the displea-
sure of Allah (which, they add, was
