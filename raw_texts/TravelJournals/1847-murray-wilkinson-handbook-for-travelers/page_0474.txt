Among the contemplar deities are
He, Amunre, Isis, and Pthah; and
Kneph, sat, and Anouke, the triad
of the cataracts. The monarch is
frequently accompanied by his een
Noeraﬁ. The total depth 0 this
excavation is about ninety feet from
the door.

The great temﬂe is remarkable for
the most beautiful colossi found in
any of the Egyptian ruins, repre-
senting Remeses II. They are
seated on thrones, attached to the
rock, and the faces of some of them,
which are fortunately well preserved,
evince a beauty of expression, the
more striking, as it is unlocked for,
in statues of such dimensions. I had
not an Opportunity of ascertaining
their total height, but from the length
of the arm I calculate it to be about
sixty feet, requiring a pedestal of at
least seven more. Some of their
dimensions arm—the ear 3 feet 5 in.;
foreﬁnger (i. c. to the fork of middle
ﬁnger) 3 feet; from inner side of
elbow joint to end of middle ﬁnger,
15 feet, &c. The total height of the
facade of the temple may be between
90 and 100 feet. It was not till
after my visit to Nubia, that Mr. IIay
cleared to the base of the two colossi
on the south side of the door. He
also exposed to view the curious
Greek inscription of the Ionian and
Carian soldiers of Pssmsticns, ﬁrst
discovered by Mr. Bankes and Mr.
Salt, as well as some interesting
hieroglyphic tablets.

The above-mentioned inscription
is of very great interest, upon several
accounts. It appears to have been
written by the troops sent by the
Egyptian king after the deserters,
who are said by Herodotus to have
left the service of Psarnaticus in the
following manner: —-

“ In the reign of Psammitichns
these troops had been stationed at
Elephantine, to protect the country
from the EthiOpians; . . . and, having
been kept three whole years in gar-
rison, without being relieved, they
resolved with one accord to desert

the king, and go over to the Ethio-
pians. As soon as this news reachd
anmitichus, he pursued them, and
having overtaken them, he in vain
endeavoured by entreaties and every
argumenttoprevailonthem notto
abandontheircountry,theirgoda,their
children, and their wives. . . . But,
deaf to his argumenmtlieycontinued .
theirroute,andonarriving in Ethiopia,
they gave themselves up to the king
of the country, who rewarded them
with the possession of lands belong-
ing to certain refractory Ethiopians,
whom they were ordered to expel.
They therefore settled there; and the
Ethiopians became more civilised
by adopting the customs of these
Egyptians.” The position of their
settlement he places above Meroil,
after which city he says, “ you arrive
at the country of the Automoles
(desertcrs) in as many days as it
took you to go from Elephantine to
the capital of the Ethiopians. These
Automoles are called Asmach; which
word translated signiﬁes 'those who
stand on the left hand of the king,’
ﬁnd their numbers when they deserted
were 240,000.”

The inscription is in a curious
style of Greek, with a rude indica-
tion of the long vowels, the more re-
markable, as it dates about 912 years
before Simonides. It is not quite
intelligible; but Colonel Lealte gives
the following version and transla-
tion : —

From this it appears that the “ king

Elephantine, and sent his troops after
