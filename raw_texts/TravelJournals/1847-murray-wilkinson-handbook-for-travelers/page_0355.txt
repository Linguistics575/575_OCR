and torus. In the interior are cells,
and it contains the scattered residue
of burnt bones. Through one of its
side walls an entrance has been forced
into the adjoining tomb. The storin-
loin appears to have had the name in
Coptic of Ptoou-fr-atnépe, from the
nei uring city.

ere. as at Arsino'd, the reason as-
signed by De Pauw for the worship
of the crocodile seems fully borne
out. by the position of Athribis; for
it is certain that unless the canal from
the Nile were carefully kept up, the
sacred animals could not have had ac-
cess to the town that worshipped them.

Auntie, or Ellen’s, on the east
bank, isthe site of Qtemmis or Pano-
polis, in Coptic Chmim or Shmin,
formerly one of the most considerable
cities of the Theba'id. Tlh modern
Ekhmim is about a quarter “of a mile
from the Nile. It has the size ofan
ordinary Egyptian bender, with a
bazaar, and a market day every Wed-
nesday.

On the side of the town furthest
from the river, beyond the present
walls, are the remains of some of its
ancient buildings.

A long inscription. bearing the
date of the l2th year of the Emperor
Trajnnus Gennanicus Dacicus, points
out the site of the temple of Psn;
who, as we learn from the dedication,
shared with 'l‘hriphis the honours of
the sanctuary. We also ascertain
another very important feet from this
inscription, that the deity, who has
been called Priaptts and Mendel. is
in reality the Pan of Egypt, his
figure being represented on the same
face of the stone with the dedication;
which accords rer well with the de-
acription of the eity of PanOpolis,
given by Stephanus of Bysantium.

twelve compartments. probably astro-

are nearly all defaced.

These are, doubtlms. the remains

some distance beyond, which may
probably have belonged to the temple
of Perseus; but a few imperfect
