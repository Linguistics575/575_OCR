of 8 mileecan only include theeastern
partabont the town of Biwah. Be-
tween 9 and 3 miles to the east of
Beewab is the temple of Amun, now
called Om Baydah, “ mother white;"
aodnearitiswhat is supposedtobe
the fountain of the Sunywhich mea-
sures about 80 feet by 55. and is form-
ed by springs. The water appears to
be warmer in the night than the day,
and is 12° heavier in speciﬁc gra-
vitythan that of the Nile.

The ruins at 0m Baydah are not
of very great extent, but suﬂlcient
remains to show the style of building;
and many of the sculptures still re-
main.

Amun-Neph, or Amun, with the
attributes of the ram.headed , as
might be expected, is the principal
deity. The ﬁgures of other divinities
are also preserved, and the many
bieroglyphics that remain on the
walls, and fallen stones, make us re-
gret that these records of so remark-
able a monument should not have
been all copied. These remains, in
a place possessing such historical as-
sociations as the “ Oasis of Ammon,"
certainly offer as great an interest as
any in Egypt; and. judging from the
destruction of temples in other parts
of the country, we can scarcely hope
for the continued preservation of
these ruins. Baron Minutoll has
given many curious details and views
of this temple, which has since been
visited and described by Caillaud and
other travellers; and we may hope
that M. Linant will add still more to
our information on the subject of
this Oasis.

Near the temple is the supposed
fountain of the Sun above mentioned.

Little less than three quarters of a
mile from 0m Bsydah. and about
9 miles E. S. E. by 8., from the
town of Seewah, is a hill called Dar
Aboo Bereek, in which are some
ancient excavations. apparently tombs,
and a little higher up the hill are
some Greek inscriptions on the rock.

east of 86ewsh. on the way to Zay-
tooo, is a ruined temple of Roman
time; and at Zsytoon, which is about
8 miles on the road from 86ewah to
Gare, aretbe remains of two temples.
and other buildings of Roman-
Egyptian date.

Between Zaytoon and Gare. at
Mitre, is a Rotnantemlile in a marsh.
and at Gare are some tombs without
inscriptions.

There are many other sepulchral
excavations in the rock in the vicinity
of 86ewah; and Gebel el Mbt. or
“the hill of death." about three
quarters of a mile from that town,
contains numerous tombs. one of
which appears to be of an Egyptian
age.

Kasr Room, “the Greek " (or
Roman) palace, is a small Doric
temple of Roman time. once sur-
rounded by a act-ed enclosure. To
the north are some tombs in the face
of the hill, below which are the re-
mains of brick arches; and near the
village the vestiges of an ancient
town. It is about 5 miles to the
westward of Séewalt. and ashort dis-
tance to the northward of El Ka-
myseh ; where there are other tombs,
and the remains of a stone ediliee.
The ruins of Amoodayn, “the two
columns,” are a little more than half
a mile to the south-westof El Ka-
myseh. They are of little import-
ance and of late time. There are
also some ruins at Gharb Amun,
in the western district. on the way to
the lake. called Birtet Arashé'eh.
Thoughthe lake has noruinsonits
banks. it is remarkable for the re-
verence, or air of mystery, with which
it is treated by the modern inha-
bitants of the Oasis. in it is an
island. to which, till Iately,accese was
strictly forbidden to all strangers;
and the credulous tried to persuade
others, as well as themselves, that the
sword, crown,and seal of Solomon
were preserved there as a charm for
the protection of the Oasis. ll.
