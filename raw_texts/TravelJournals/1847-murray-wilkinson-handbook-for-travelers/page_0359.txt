Pococke and Norden, it was a quarter
of a mile from the river; but it is
now on the bank, and part of it. has
already been washed away by the
stream. This is one of many proofs
of the great changes that have taken
place in the course of the Nile within
a few years, and fully accounts for
certain towns, now on the river, being
laid down by ancient geographers in
an inland position.

At Girgeh there is a Latin convent
or monastery, the superior of which is
an Italian. It is the oldest Roman
Catholic establishment now in Egypt.
those of Elthmim, Fat-shoot, and
Tahta, being the nest in order of
antiquity. That of Negideh was the
most ancient. It was not from a
Latin but from n Copt convent that
Girgeh received its name, and Girgis,
or George, as is well known, is the
patron saint of the Egyptian Chris-
tians. Leo Africanus tells us that
“ Girgeh was formerly the largest
and most opulent monastery of
Christians, called after St. George,
and inhabited by upwards of 200
monks, who possessed much land in
the neighbourhood. They supplied
food to all travellers; and so great
was the amount of their revenues,
that they annually sent a large sum
to the patriarch of Cairo, to be dis-
tributed among the poor of their own
persuasion. About a hundred years

gypt, and carried at? all the monks
of this convent, wherefore the prince
of Menshé’e’h surrounded the building
with a strong wall, and erected houses
within, for the abode ol'various wonk-
mcn and shopkeepers. in process of
time, however, the patriarch of the
Jacobites (or Copts) having made a
representation to the Sultan, he gave
orders that another monastery should
be built on the spot, where an ancient
city formerly stood, and assigned to it
only a sutlicient revenue to enable
it to maintain thirty monks.

If the traveller intends to visit
Abydes. in going up the Nile, he will
do well to hire asses at Gin and
ride over to the ruins, whtch will
occupy three hours. To save time,
his boat may be sent on to Bellianeh,
or to Bamata, with orders to wait
there until he joins it in the eveni .
From Abydus to Bellianeh is a e
of two hours. For the same reason,
if he visits the ruins on his return, he
may statt from Samata, or from
Bellianeh, and rejoin his boat at
Girgeh; and if he intends to use his
pencil, ormake notes ofthescul
there, he had better start early to the
morning, and have the day before
him. The distance from the river to
Abydus is reckoned by Pliny at 7‘
Roman miles, which is the same as
from Abydus to the modern villageol’
Satnata. Near this spot was probably
the mouth of the canal, mentioned by
Strsbo, which led from the river to
that ancient city. passing, as does the
road at the present day, through a
grove of acanthus or acacia trees.

In the plain between Girgeh and
Abydus is the town of Bonﬁre. well
known in the time of the Memlooka.
and which gave the title El Bardeen.
to one of the principal beys, hence
called Osman Bey el Bardéesee.
Farther to the S. W. is a town with
old mounds, called 5! Baruch—a
name taken from the Coptic Perpe,
“ the temple." and commonly applied
to ancient buildinga Some suppose
it marks the site of This, which the
geographer says was in the vicinity of
Abydus.

The modern name of Abydes is
Anibal cl Malfoda (i. e. “ the
buried " ), in Coptic Shut. its ruins
are on a grand scale, and of consider-
able antiquity, dating in the time of
Osirei l..and his son, the Great Rh
