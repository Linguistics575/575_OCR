People of all classes, and of all
Moslem nations, who happen to be in
E811", repair to the festival; and
many a Cairene, who has not an ap-

nity of joining a party to Tanta,
s leh to regret the pleasure. or the
proﬁt, he has lost; for with many it
s a source of speculation, as well as
pleasure; and some repay themselves
handsomely for the journey. The
greater part, however, attend merely
or amusement, and a' few jht’lurs
at the tomb are repeated, without
much trouble, on the chance of a
blessing from the saint.

'lhe ﬁts lasts ei ht days, and is
succeeded by that o Ibrahim e‘ Des-
aookee. held at the village of Dessools,
on the Rosetta branch, nearly opposite
e’ Rahmaneah. This, which is second
only in rank to the ﬁts of Tanta, is
followed by those of Abooreésh, of
Ahoo Mandoor, of el 30%, of el
Abb‘aee, and others, each lasting
eight days. These ﬁles occur twice
a year, those of Cairo once only; the
peeple of the Delta perhaps thinking
that suﬂlcient honour would not be
done to their saint unless they gave
him two birthdays in Me year.

The-Sayd cl Beddowee seems to
have succeeded to the god of Schen-
nytus, the Egyptian Hercules, whose
attributes have been given him by
popular fancy or tradition. it is the
Soan whose aid is invoked, when any
one is in need of strength to resist a
sudden calamity; theeﬂ'ects of astorm,
or any Mghtful accident are thought
to be averted by calling out 9‘ Ya
Sayd. ya Beddowee; " and the song
oi “ Gab el Yoosara,“ “ he brought
back the captives,” records the might
and prowess of this powerful hero.

There do not appear to beany ruins
of an ancient city at Tanta; but re-

ort speaks of a trilinguar inscription
ii: a mask there, as well asat Menoéf,
the truth of which it would be in-
teresting to ascertain. '

That we may ﬁnd another of those
valuable documents, or duplicates of
the Rosetta stone, is a very reasonable

 

hope, as there is little doubt that do-
crees were made in Greek and E
tian, both in the time of the Ptolemi.
and Caesars, copies of which were
deposited in all the principal temples;
and when we read on the Rosetta
stone that the same memorial was
ordered to be placed “in the temples
of the ﬁrst, second, and third orders,”
we are surprised that several copies
of it have not been discovered.

The Delta was in ancient times com-
posed of 85 names, including the
Oasis of Ammon and Nitriotis; and
its modern provinces are seven, which
are subdivided into thirteen depart-
ments : —
