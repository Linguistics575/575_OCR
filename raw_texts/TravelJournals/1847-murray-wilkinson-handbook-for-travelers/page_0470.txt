the Caters, unﬁnished as usual; and

Sabéoa. — Sabdoo, so called from
“the lions " (androsphinaes) of the
dromos, is of the early epoch of Re-
meses the Great. It is all built of
sandstone, with the exception of the
adytum, which is excavated in the
rock. The dromos was adorned with
eight sphinxes on either side, and ter-
minated by two statues with sculp-
tured stehe at their back ; tothis suc-
ceeded the two pyramidal towers of
the propylon : the area, with eight Osi-
ride ﬁgures attached to the pillars,
supporting the architraves and roofs
of the lateral corridors; and the in-
terior chambers, which are now closed
by the drifted sand. Amunre and Re
were the chief deities, and from the
worship of the god of Thebes the town
bore the same name as that city—

The district about Derr, on the
east bank, abounds in date trees; and
between that town and Koroslto they
reckon 20,000 that are taxed.

Dem—Den, or Dayr, the capital of
Nubia, is a short distance to the south
of Hassaia, on the opposite bank. It
is worthy of remark that all the tem-
ples between the two cataracts, ex-
cept Derr, Ibreem, and Feriyg. are
situated on the west side of the Nile;
and, instead of lying on the arable
land, are all built on the sandy plain,
or hewn in the rock. This was,
doubtless, owin to their keeping the
small portion 0% land they possessed
for cultivation, while the towns and
temples occupied what could be of
no utility to the inhabitants.

The temple of Derr is of the time
of Remeses the Great, and presents
some of the spirited sculptures of that
epoch, though in a very mutilated
