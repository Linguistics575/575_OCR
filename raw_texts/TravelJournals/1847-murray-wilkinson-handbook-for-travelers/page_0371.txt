lumns. 0n the former are the ovals
of the king, Atinra Bakhan, who is
found in the grottoes -of Tel el
Amarna.

Opposite Eons is Negddsla, noted
for its Coptic and Catholic convents,
and, in Aboolfeda's time, for its gar-
dens and sugar-cane. It has no
ruins; but W, on the east
bank, a few miles south of Eons,
presents the extensive mounds of an
ancient town, where M. Prisse found
a temple of Roman time, dedicated
to Horus, with the name of the town

Between Shenhoor end Thebes the
river makes a considerable curve to
the east ; and a little above this bend,
just below Thebes, on the west bank,
is Gamble (Eamola). It was noted
in Aboolfede‘s time for its numerous
gardens and sugar-cane plantations,
which are mentioned also by Norden.
At the time of the rebellion of Shelth
Ahmed, the soi-disoat wiséer, in
1823, it was the residence of the well-
known Ali Kashef Aboo-Tarboosh,
who defended the military post there
against the insurgents with great gal-
lentry.

Medal-rot stands inland on the east.
It is supposed-to mark the site of
Maximienopolis, a Greek bishop‘s
see under the Lower Empire; but
neither the extent of its mounds, nor
the remains of its temple, justify the
name that some have applied to it of
Kernak a' Sherké'e'h, or " the eastern
Karnak." It is generally visited
from Thebes.

Some write the name Mew-amend,
as though it were called from amend,

The ruins of Madam“ consist of
crude brick houses of a small town,
about 464 paces square, in the centre
of which is a sandstone temple; but
of this little remains, esocpt part of
the portion, apparently, from the style
of its architecture, of Ptolma‘lc data.
On the columns may be traced the
ovals of Ptolemy Energetes ll.,of
Lathyrus, and of Auletes, as well as
thoseofthe Emperor Antoninus Pins;
but a block of granite assigns a much
higher antiquity to the temple itself,
and proves from the name of Amu-
mph 11., that its foundation is at
least co'sival with the middle of the
l5th century before our era. The
pylon before the portico bears the
name of Tiberius, but the blocks
used in its construction were taken
from some older ediﬁce, erected or
repaired during the reign of Berneses
II.

steps on the inner side, similar to that
before the temple at El K h (in
the Great Oasis), at Kern and
many other places. To the south-
ward of the portico appears to be the
site of a reservoir, beyond which a
gateway leads through the side of the
crude brick wall to a smell ruin,
bearing the name of Ptolemy Ener-
getes I. Besides the enclosure of
the temple, is a wall of similar ma-
terials, that surrounded the whole
town, which was of an irregular
shape. .
