ALEXANDRIA. — 1. Arrival
at Alexandria.

Pompey‘s pillar is in latitude 81°
id 45" N. and longitude 29° 54’ E.
from Greenwich. The coast is ex-
ceedingly low, so that the highest
parts only begin to be seen at the dis-
tance of about 18 miles, and the line
of the coast itself is not discernible
till within 13 or 14. Though there is
water to the depth of 6 fathoms close
to the Pharoc, and from 5} to 4 along
the whole shore to the point of Eu-
nostus, at the entrance of the western
harbour, and at l; mile oﬂ' not less
than 20 fathoms, it is exceedingly
dangerous toapproach at night. There
is, however, very ood holding ground
in the roads; angshipsanchormr lay
to, about a mile offshore. The ﬁrst
objects perceived from the sea are
Pompey's Pillar, the forts on the
mounds raised by the French, the
Pharos and new lighthouse, and the
buildings on the lies e' Tin (the
“Cape of Figs"). between the two
ports; and on nearing the land, the
obelisk, the Pasha's hart-em and palace,
the houses of the town, the masts of
ships. and the dill'erent batteries
(which have been lately much in-
creased), the windmills to the west,
and the line of coast extending to
Maribut Point, begin to be seen.

The old lighthouse, which occupies
the site of the ancient Pharos, on a
rock joined to the land by a cause-
way, has long been pronounced in-
sumcient for the safety of vessels
making the coast, both from its want
of height, and the bad quality of
the light itself, especially in foggy
weather, when it can scarcely be seen
till a vessel has neared the land. its
distance ham the western harbour is
an additional cause of complaint. To
remedy these inconveniences, Mo-
hammed Ali has erected a new light-
house on the point of Eunostus,
which has at least the advantage of
being in a better position for vessels
arriving from Europe; but he has
made the mistake of not having a
revolving light, which might have
been put up at little more expense.

On arriving 06' Alexandria by day-
light, a pilot comes on board, to carry
the vessel through the comrlicated
channels of the western or o d port,
which are beset with shoals and reefs.
But on making the coast late in the
evening, she lays to till daylight, and
early in the morning the pilot comes
oli'; for no captain thinks of entering
the harbour without him; the buoys
laid down by the English in lOOl, to
mark the passage, having been re-
moved as soon as they lelt the country.
There are many shoals on which the
water is not sullleieut for vessels of
large tonnage; and ﬁrst-rate line of
battle ships are obliged to take out
their guns, to enable them to pass
safely through these channels. The
main or central channel has 5 and 6
fathoms water, the Martbut 4|. 3,
and 6; others, 4, 5, and 6; but they
are very narrow, the widest not quite
