lake. which was formally called Ara-
potas; that Dinochares, an architect
ofgreat celebrity,laid down the plan,
rumbling the shpe of a Macedonian
nulls, wtth a circular border full of
pats, and ' 'ng into corners on
in right and leﬂ; theﬁhh part ofits
lite hing even then dedicated to the
pahee." This architect is better
known by the name of Dinocrstes;
antlis the samewho rebuilt the fa-
mous templeof Ephesus, after its de-
Iruttion by Eratostratus, and who
Ind previously proposed to Alexander
to cut Mount Athos into a statue of
the king holding in one hand a city
of l0,000 inhabitants, and from the
other pouring a copious river into the
sea. But the naturalist gives us very
little information respecting the pub-
lic buildings or monuments of the
city.

In Plutarch‘s life of Alexander is
a fabulous story of the foundation of
Alexandria, related by the people of
the place, who pretended its com-
mencement to have been owing to “ a
vision, wherein a greyheaded old man
of venerable aspect appeared to stand
before the king in his sleep, and to
pronounce these words: —

lying a little above the Canopic
mouth of the Nile, though nowjoined
to the continent by a causeway. As
soon as he saw the eommodious situ-
ation of the spot opposite the island,
being a neck of land of a suitable
brea th, with a great lake on one side,
and on the other the sea, which there
forms a capaclous haven, he said,
‘Homer, besides his other excellent
qualities, was a very good architect,'
and ordered the plan of the city to be
drawn catresponding to the locality.
For want of chalk, the soil being
black, they made use of ﬂour, with
which they drew a line about the se-
micircular bay that forms the port.
This was again marked out with
straight lines, and the form of the city
resembled that of a Macedonian cloak.
While Alexander was pleasing him-
self vrith this project, an inﬁnite num-
ber of binds of several kinds, rising
suddenly like a blaclt cloud out of
the river and the lake, devoured all
the ﬂour that had been used in mark-
ing out the lines; at which omen he
was much troubled, till the augurs
encouraged him to proceed, by ob-
serving that it was a sign the city he
was about to build would enjoy such
abundance of all things, that it would
contributetothe noutishment oftnany
nations. He therefore commanded
the wmlunen to go on, while he went
to visit the temple of Jupiter Am-
man."
