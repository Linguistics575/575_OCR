back, are all that I could ﬁnd upon its
fallen blocks.

The obelisks and other remains are
much buried, and the hieroglyphics
cannot be copied, without previously
clearing them from the soil accumu-
lated around them. On the mounds
at the east of the area is a shekh's
tomb, from which you haves very es-
tensive view over the country; and
beyond this, nearly in a line with the
8. E. corner of the enclosure, is a
broken monolith without sculpture.

Nearly half a mile from the temple,
in the direction of S. E. by 8., are
several large round blocks of granite,
in two lines, which appear to have
once formed the avenue to another
temple, now destroyed. They are
much corroded, and I could discover
no hieroglyphics. or traces of sculp-
ture, on any of them. They stand
nearly east and west, like the other
temple, and at the western end are
two square blocks resembling tablets;
about 80 feet beyond which are other
remains of granite, and some white
stone, probably marking the site of
the building to which they formed
the avenue. 0n the mounds to the
N. W. of this are three blocks bear-
ing the name of the great Remeses;
and on those to the S. W. of the great
temple are the walls of crude brick
houses. '

The modern village consists of
mere huts, with the exception of a
ﬁner built by Shelteer Eﬂ'endi, who
set up nitre works here some years
since, of which the ruins alone re-
main. The _I_(asr is occupied by an
Armenian a cut for the ﬁsheries, who
was absent uring my visit to San.

The canal of Mo’és, or Toorat
M031, is a noble work, bein on an
average about 150 feet bros , nevi...
gable all the year for large boats and
having the character of a river, here
and there with small islands, and
steep banks, like the Nile. And
such is its importance to this part of
the country, that it has been styled
the “ Golden Canal."

The abundance of ﬁsh in the Toorat
Mo'és is very remarkable, and I have
seen men catch many of the sums
shell with their hands (as at Toweel),
by seeking them in hollow parts
of the muddy bottom. Many people
are employed in ﬁshing there with
nets, rods, and lines; which last
have numerous books fastened to
them, without baits, and being drag-
ged along the bottom of the canal by
men holding the two ends from the
opposite banks, catch those that are
lodged in the mud They have esta-
blished ferry-boats on the Toorat
Mo'e's, which are dragged across by a
rape; and the scenes of confusion in
an evening. as the cattle on their way
home cross the water, are often very
amusing.

At Maid of Emit is a Bear or villa
of the Pasha, where he stops occa-
sionally to assemble the chiefs of dis-
tricts, for the settlement of accounts,
and other matters relative to their
administration; and at Tel Home!
are the mounds of an old town.

Bubastt's, the Pibcsetlt of Scrip-
ture, is one mile to the south of
Zakaseels, and nearly the same
distance from the canal. it is now
called T e1 Basta, or the " mound of
Basta," in which we trace the ancient
name of the city of Pasht, the Egyptian
Diana. The mounds are very exten-
sive, and consist of the remains of the
