Rosetta is a smaller town than
Damietta, but better built, and may
be about I; mile in diameter. It is
little known in history, but to us it
recalls a sad memorial, of an unsuc-
cessful attempt to restore the authority
of the Mernlooks, and the disastrous
retreat of our army, in 1807.

The river at Rosetta is perfectly
ﬂesh, except after a long prevalence
of northerly winds, when the sea wa-
ter, forced upwards, makes it slightly
salt, and well water is brought for
sale to the town and the boats. The
n is (1th 6 miles by the river, or
3 miles across the plain.

About 1 mile to the south of R0-
setta is a lull, called Aboo Mandoor,
on which stands a telegraph, now
locked up, and only intended in case
of alarm on the coast. This hill is
supposed to mark the site of an an-
cient town, probably Bolbitine, and
it was this commanding position that
the English occupied on their advance
upon Rosetta in 1807.

Below are two mosh, very pic-
turesque objects from the river, which
seem to mark the limits of the fer-
tile soil of the neighbourhood of Ru-
It‘ll.

Damanhoor is the capital of El
Bahayreh, l. e. “ the lower " or
" northern" province. It is called
hy Ahooll'éda Damanhoor cl \‘l'éhesh,
“of the desert." and in Coptic Pi.
dimenhbr, or Tminhi'rr. It is sup-
posed to he the successor of Hermo-
polie Parse, which was near. or, as
Stnabo says, on the riru r, the Canopic
hranch passing through the plain to
the north of it.
