Strabo pretends that no singer,
ﬂute-player, or minstrel, was allowed
to be present at the rites performed
in the temple of Osiris at Abydus,
though customary at those of other
deities; but it is probable that the
prohibition was conﬁned to some

'cular occasions, without extend-
ng to all the, ceremonies practised
there in his honour. The reservoir
mentioned by the geographer, which
was cased with large stones, may
perhaps be traced on the east of
the ancient town; and it was to
this that a canal brought the water
from the Nile, passing, as does the
present canal, through the grove
of Acanthus, which was sacred to
Apollo.

From Abydus, also (as in Strabo's
time), a road leads to the Great
Oasis, ascending the Libyan chain
of mountains nearly dueyest of the
town. Another road runs to the
same Oasis from El ﬁalaat, a village
further to the south of Samhood,
which is the one taken by those who
go from and to Farshoot, and other
places in this part of the valley; the
ascent and descent being so much
more easy than by the mountain
road, or path, to the west of Abydus.

The cemetery is to; the northward,
where several stelm have been found
of the time of Osirtasen, and other
early Pharaohs; and some blocks
present the ovals of the Great Re-
meses, and others that of the Ethi-
Opian Sabaco.

At the projecting corner of the
mountain, to the northwest, are
limestone quarries, and an inclined
road leading to a shaft or narrow
grotto, some way up. in the face of
the rock. which is in an unﬁnished
state, and without sculpture.

Bellioneli has succeeded to an old
town, whose mounds marl its site.
In Coptic name is Tpourané. 0n
the opposite, or eastern, bank, stood
Lepidoma, so called from the worship
of the ﬁsh Lepiddes; but its exact
position is unknown, though a place
of some size and importance, and
mentioned by Ptolemy as one of the
large cities of E3 pt.

Somlaood, inlan on the west bank,
occupies the site of an ancient town,
called in Coptic Bernht‘iout, or Pseu-
hbout; for though placed more to
the north in the Coptic MSS., it is
evident this name can only apply to
the modern town of Samhood, whose
mounds sufﬁciently indicate its anti-
quity. About the district of Sherg
el Khayiitn, the Nile makes a con-
siderable bend, but resumes its gene-
rni course, about north and south,
near El Hamra.

Far-shoot, inland to the west from
the districtof El Kilh, is a large town,
called in Coptic Bershoout. It is
the residence of a recliner. or pro-
vincial governor, and was formerly a
town of consequence, but has greatly
fallen off within the last few years, as
well in size as in the number of its
inhabitants. Many of the houses are
in a ruinous state, and quite deserted;
and of late it has only been remark-
able as the head-quarters of the
Nisdas, or new troops of Mohammad
Ali, the native portion of the army
having been ﬁrst drilled here in tail
and 1899.
