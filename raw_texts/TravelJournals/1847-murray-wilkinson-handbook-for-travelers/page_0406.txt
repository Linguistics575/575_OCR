In the Opposite chamber are several .
boats, with square chequered sails,‘
some having spacious cabins, and.
others only a seat near the mast.
They are richly painted, and loaded .
with ornaments; and those in thei
lower lines have the mast and yard '
lowered over the cabin.

The succeeding room, on the right f
hand, contains the various arms and
warlike implements of the Egyptians;
among which are knives, quilted
helmets, spears, yatagaus or daggers,
quivers, bows, arrows, falchions,
coats-of-mail, darts, clubs, and stan-
dards. On either side of the door is
a black cow with the head-dress of

The nest contains agricultural

sowing and reaping vrhcat, and I
grain, which {tom its height and
round head appears to be the doom or
sorghum, as well as the ﬂowers of the
country, are represented. But how-
ever successful the Egyptians may
have been in seizing the character
of animals, they failed in the art of
drawing trees and ﬂowers, and their
coloured plants would perplex the
most profound botanist equally with
the fanciful productions of an Arabic
herbarium. That which follows con-

. tains diﬂ‘erent forms of the god Osiris,

having various attributes.

The second chamber, on the op-
posite side, merely offers emblems
and deities. in the next are birds
and some productions of Egypt, as
geese and quails, eggs, pomegranates,
grapes, with other fruits and herbs,
