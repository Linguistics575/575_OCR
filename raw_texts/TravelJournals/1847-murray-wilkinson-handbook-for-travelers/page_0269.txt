every one knew to be false), wes
obliged to return to Menuleh, in
spite of ell my ettemyrts, by bribery
end persueslon, to induce them to
relent.

Meteré'e'h is ell ﬁsb;—the hosts,
the houses, the streets, the beskets,
the people’s bends, ell are full of ﬁsh.
They cstch ﬁsh, they all. ﬁsh, they
live on ﬁsh, end by ﬁsh; end one
would think it bed been founded by
the lchthyophegi themselves. The ﬁsh
is dried end selted here, end sent on
cemels or esses to Menzeleh, whence
it is oerried by the cenel to diﬁ'erent
perts of the country; the ﬁsheries of
the lekeend eenels being ell formed by
some weelthy Christien speculetor.

Meteré‘éh stends on e point of lend
prgjecting into the leke, between 6
en 7 miles from Menuleb, to the N.
of which is enother village, celled El
Ghusneb, united to it by e dylte or
ceusewey. Due E. of it is Shekh
Abdelleh, in an island celled Toone,
ebout 2 miles from the shore, where
ere e cepitel of red grenite, some en-
crent ruins of little importence, end n
shekh’s tomb, whence its modern
neme. The leke ebounds in islands.
The most interesting to en sntiquery
is thet of Tennces, the encient Ten-
nesus. The remeins there are of
Romen time, end consist of beths,
tombs end substructions. 'nte tombs
ere veulted end peinted, mostly red
on e white ground. There etc also
eerthenwere pipes, stemped with e
letter or mark, either of the owner
or the msker.

Pdusiem is about 98 mile! to the
8. E. of this islend, end ebout ll
from the lake.

The Leke ltleneeleh mey either be
visited from Metere'e'h, Demiette,
Menuleh, or the cenel of Moes ; but
in order not to be diseppointed, es
was my fete et the ﬁrst of these pleces,
it mey be as well to send over from
Menuleh to secure I boot; which
my the be done, when Toweel on
