by one of the Pharaohs, on an ele-
vated spot nearasmall canal from the
Nile, at the time of the Exodus of the
Jews, after he had aﬂicted them with
the drudgery of hewing stones and
other laborious employments.” Here,
too,tbeypretend “thebody of Joseph,
the son of Israel, was buried,” which
washer-wards removed by the Jews at
their departure; and the surrounding
country is famed for the abundance
of its fruit and olives; thou h these
last are only lit for eating,au§ useless
for their oil. Wansleb says the Copts
still call the city Arsino'é, in their
books, and relates a strange tradi-
tion of its having been burnt by a
besieging enemy, who tied torches
to the tails of cats, and drove them
into the town. This is evidently
an Arab tale, taken from Samson's
foxes.

The whole extent of the cultivable
part of the Pyoém measures about 23
miles north and south, and 28 east
and west, which last was in former
times extended to upwards of 40. in
that part (from Kasr Khsroon to
Tomé'éh), where it has the greatest
breadth. Its length north and
south, if measured to the other side of
the lake, is increased to 39 miles.
The Fj'oém is governed by a tun-r,
or niser. within thejurisdiction ofthe
hey or modccr of Benisooef, who,
like all the other provincial chiefs, is
under the governor of Upper Egypt,
residing at Osioot.

Strabo says the Arsino’ite nome ex-
celled all others in appearance. in
goodness, and in condition. It was
the only place where the olire tree
nrrired at any sire. or bore good
fruit. except the gardensof Alexan-
dria. That nome, too, produced a
great quantity of wine, as well as
corn, r etables, and plants of all
kinds. n Coptic it is called Piotn,
which was probably derived from
l’iomi, “ the cultivated land.”
Though its merits have been greatly
exaggerated, it is still superiu' to other

uctions; since, in addition tocorn,
cotton, and the usual cultivated
plants, it abounds in roses, apricots.
ﬁgs, grapes, olives, and several other
fruits, which grow there in greater
perfection and abundance than in the
valley of the Nile; and the rose-
water used in Cairo comes from-the
neighbourhood of Medeeneh.

Near Biggig, about 2 miles to the
33‘”. of Medeeneb, is an obelisk of
the time of Osirtasen, ﬁrst erected like
that of Heliopolis, about the time of
Joseph‘s arrival in Egypt. It has
been thrown down, and broken in
two parts; one about 96} feet, the
other 16 feet 8 inches long. One
face and two sides are only visible;
and few hieroglyphics remain on the
lower part. The mean breadth of
the face is 5 feet 2 inches, or 6 feet
9} inches at the lower end, and the
sides are about It feet in width. At
the upper part of the face are ﬁve
compartments, one over the other;
in each of which are two Bguresof
king Osirtasen oﬂ'ering to two deities.
Below are columns of hiero lyphics.
many of which are quite ﬁlegible.
The other face is under the ground.
On each of the two sides is a single
column of hiero lyphics, containing
the name of the ting, who on on. in
saidtobebeloved by Pthah, on on
other by Mandoo; eridently the two
principal deities of the lace. On
the summit of the obeli n va
has been cut. doubtless to hold some
ornament, as that of lleliopolis;
though this of Biggig dill'ers from it.
and from other obelisks, in its apex
bein round, and not pointed. The
people of the country look upon these
f ments with the same superstitious
fee ing as the stones of the temple at
Panopolis, and some other places;
and the women recite the Fat’ha over
themin thehopsofa numerousol'o
