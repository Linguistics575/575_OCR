east extremity of the Elanitic guif.
contains some miserable houses and
a fort, where a governor resides with
a few Turks. The name signiﬁes “ a
mountain pass.” It is a pretty spot,
with the advantage of the see before
it, which. after the monotonous co-
lour of the desert, is a pleasing ob-
ject; but it may be doubted whether
it is worth the 'ourney, if the traveller
damnatinten going thenceto Petra.
It stands about 2 miles south of the
site of Aildtb or Ailatlt, which, like
its neighbour Esion-geher, was re-
markable for the importance attached
to it in the time of Solomon, and
from having been the channel by
which the treasures of Arabia and
indie ﬂowed to Syria. It was the
po-ersion of this point that led to
the wealth of Solomon; and it is
curious to observe how every place
has successively risen to importance
the moment it enjoyed the beneﬁts of
the Indian trade.

When the Edomites were con-
quered by David, the whole of their
country to the head of the Elanitic

ulf fell into the possession of the

aws; all the “ Edomites became
David's servants." and “ he put gar-
risons in Edam." (1 Chron. sviii.
ll.) Solomon aﬂerwards established
and “ made a navy of ships at Brion-
geber, which is beside Eloth, on the
shore of the lied Sea, in the land of
Edam." The ships were navigated
by thnicians in the service of the
Jen'ish king, whose friendship with
Hiram secured for him the aid of
those skilful navigators; and this
important source of wealth continued
in the hands of the kings of Judah
until the Edontites "resulted from
under the hand of Judah. and made a
king over themselves,” in the rvi n of
Joram. (1 Kings is. 96.; 9 ings
viii. 20.)

Blurb was called by the Romans
Ailo or .t'la; but this and Brian-
geher lost all their importance under
the Greeks and Banana; the ports

Arsino’e, succeeded to the commerce
of the East ; and the Elanitic gulfen-
joyed little of the lucrative traﬂc of
former days. And if Petra, the
capital of the Edomitea, which once
proﬁted so much from the of
Eastern commerce, continued to the
late time of the Roman empire to
beneﬁt by its position on the way
from Arabia toSyria.tbe trade that
passed through it was principally eon-
ﬁned to that of caravans, the rise of
Alexandria having put a stop to the
trafﬁc from the eastern end of the
Red Sea.

Aila or Aihh is mentioned by
Arab writers. and a quotation from
Macrisi, given by Burckhardt, speaks
of it as near to Eaion- . “ It

lbn Ahmed Ibn Touloun (a caliph
of Egypt) made the road over the
Akaba, or steep mountain, before
Aila. There were many musks at
Aila, and many Jews lived there. It
was taken by the Franks during the
crusades, but in 566 a. u. Salah ed
dcen (Saladin) transported ships on
camels from Cairo to this place, and
recovered it from them. Near Aiia
was formerly situated a large
and handsome town called Assioun

of the island of Graia, now known to
