6. Hrs-roar or luxurious.—
Alexandria was founded on the site
of a small town called Racbtis, or
Rhacbtis, by the great conqueror
aﬂer whom it received its name.

Its commodious harbour and other
local recommendations rendered it a
convenient spot for the site of a com-
mercial city, and its advantageous
position could not fail to strike the
penetrating mind of the son of Philip.
It promised to unite Europe, Arabia,
and India ; to be a successful rival of
Tyre ; and to become the future em-
porium of the world.

In the time of the Pharaonic kings
the trade of Egypt was conﬁned to the
countries bordering on the Arabian
Gulf; and if, as is possible, India
may be included among the number
of those with which the Egyptians
traded, (either directly by water, or
through Arabia,)the communication
was maintained by means of that see,
or by land over the Isthmus of Sues.
Indeed, I heliete that {Ennum (or,
as it was afterwards called. Philotera).
and the predecessor of Arsinoi‘, were
the only two ports on the Red Sea
during the rule of the early Pharaohs;
the small harbours (the par-res are!“
of Pliny) being then, as afterwards,
merely places of refuge for vessels in
stress of weather, or at night during a
coasting voyage; and no towns yet
existed on the sites of those known in
