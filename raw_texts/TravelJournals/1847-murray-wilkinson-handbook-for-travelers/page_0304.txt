The roads to. Abydus, to Osioot,
and to Farahoot, go from El Kbargeh.
The northernmost one is that to
Osioot.

After six hours’ march with camels,
on the road from El Khargeh to
Farshoot, or to Abydus, you come to
a Roman fort of crude briclt, about
ninety paces square, with a doorway
of burnt brick on one side. The
walls are very thick, about 50 feet
high, and defended by strong towers
projecting at the corners and three of
the faces; and, from its position,
about 100 paces south of the spring,
it is evident that it was intended for
the protection of this, the only water-
ing place, on the way to the Nile.
It is called 13' Deyr, ' ‘ the convent,"
probably in consequence of its having
been occupied at a subsequent period
by the Christians, who have left
another ruined building in the vici-
nity, with two vaulted chambers, in
which are some Coptic and Arabic
inscriptions. Seven minutes' walk
to the north-west from the fort is
another ruin, with vaulted chambers,
but without any inscriptions.

The rest of the journey to the valley
of the Nile at Abydus occupies nearly
three days, or from thirty-two to 84
hours' march. Nothing is met with
on the way but remains of enclosures
made with rough stones, at intervals;
and much hrolten pottery, during the

formed in about 50 hours from Bay-
reea to the Nile. There is also a
road from El Khergeh to Reseltet,
which occupies the same time, ﬁfty
hours, and that distance is computed
at about 195 miles.

Sevml roads lead from the Nile
to the convents, and to other parts of
the desert; but the best and most
frequented is that from Dayr Byid, a
village Opposite Benisooef. After
crossing various torrent beds, it enters
the Wadee el Arraba, a large valley,
nearly 20 miles broad, which runs to
the Red Sea between the ranges of
the northern and southern galalle.
It has the advantages of several water-
ing-places, in the Wadee el Arraba.
the most convenient of which are at
Wadee el Areideh on the north, and
atdWadee Om Ainebeh on the south
