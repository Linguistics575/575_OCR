The stone pyramids of Doshdor,
or Harem have both been opened.
Their entrances are to the north, as in
those of Geezeh. The summit of the
second or southernmost one was
ﬁnished at a diluent angle from the
lower part; and from its being the
only pyramid of this form, I am in-
clined to think they depressed the
angle in order more speedily to com-
plete it; for, bad it retained its ori-
ginal talus, it would have been con-
siderably higher. in the passage are
some hieroglyphics, cut perhaps by
a visitor at a late period. The
northernmost of these pyramids mea-
sures, according to Colonel Vyse, 700
feet square. having been originally
7l9 ft. 5 in.; and ofits former height
of 349 it. 7 in., there now remain
8‘26 ft. 6 in. The southernmost one
has the angle of its casing in the
lower part 54° 14’ 46”, end tbeupper
part 12° 59’ ‘26”.

Here are also two crude brick py-
ramids, in one of which I could trace
the base of a chamber. The question
then naturally suggests Itself how was
this roofed? The chambers of the
crude brick pyramids of Thebes are
all vaulted, and we can scarcely sup-
pose that the roof of this was sup-
ported in any other way. Herodotus
tells us that Asychis, wishing to sur-
pass all other kings who had reigned
before him in Egypt, made a brick
pyramid for his monument, to which

he ameed this sentence engraved on
stone: “ Do not despise me, when
compared to the stone pyramids; I
am as superior to them as Jupiter to
the other Gods. For men plunging
poles into a lake, and collecting the
mud thus extracted, formed it into
bricks, of which they made me." Dr.
Richardson justly asks, in what could
this superiority over stone pyramids
consist? and suggests, that it points to
the invention of the arch that roofed
its chambers; —— which, provided
Asychie lived prior to the 16th and
18th dynasties, may possibly be true.
Those of Dashbor, and other places,
doubtless imitated the original brick
pyramid of Asyehia, in this, as well
as other peculiarities of style ; but we
are uncertain if either of these two,
or those at the entrance of the Pi-
6om, have a claim to the honour of
bearing that notable inscription.

Some give it to the northernmost
of the Dashoor brick pyramids, where
Colonel Howard Vyse discovered, in
the temple before it, a stone bearing
part of an early king's name. pro-
bably Aeychis. This pyramid, he
says, measured originally 850 feet

uare, and was 915 feet 6 inches
high, of which 90 feet now only re-
main; and the southern one was 349
feet 6 inches square, and 967 feet 4
inches high. now reduced to l56feet.
There is also a small one of brick,
close to the south of the second stone
pyramid. originally l8! feet square,
and 106 feet high.

Large groves of soar, or eeenthue,
