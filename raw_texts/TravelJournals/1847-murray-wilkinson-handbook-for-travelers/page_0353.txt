patriots; forthefewnotes I madein
a pocket-book at the time excited
their unconcealed displeasure, and
they even refused to mention the
name of the convent, until they found
it was already known to me. They
have adopted the same precaution as
their brethren at Bibbeh, in order to
secure the building in turbulent
times against the assaults of the Mos-
lems; and their Christian: patron,
like St. George of Bibbeb, is conver-
ted into a Moslem shekh, who com-
mands the respect of the credulous
under the mysterious name of Shekh
Aboo Shenoodeh. The monastery
is built of beam stones, measuring
about 3 ft. 3 in. by 1 ft. 3 in., with
a cornice like that of the Egyptian
temﬂes, all round the top, though
without the torus, which in Egyptian
architecture separates the cornice
from the architrave, or from the face
of the well. On the exterior are
square niches, once stuccoed, as was
all the building. They are placed at
intervals along all the walls, except
on that side nearest the mountain,
which has been added at a later time.
At a distance they have the appear-
ance of windows.

Six doors formerly led into the in-
terior, tire of which have been closed
up. leaving that alone on the south
side, which is now the only entrance.
Over all the doors a projecting wall
of brickwork has been built in order
to strengthen them; doubtless at a
time when they were threatened by
an attack from the Arabs or the Memo
looks, on which occasion even the
solitary door now open was closed,
and protected in the same manner.
In one place, where the brickwork
had fallen, I observed on a jarnb ol‘
the door a stone with a few hiero-
glyphics. proving the blocks to have
been taken from some old building,
probably in the neighbouring city of
Athribis. Near this door are the
fragments of red granite columns and
statues. From the walls project
blocks not unlike the gurgoyles or

water-spouts of Egyptian temples, as
at Dendera and other places, though
there is no reasootosuppose this was
ever a temple, even of late time. It
may, however, have derived its ex-
terior form from those ediﬁces, which
the builders had been accustomed to
seein the country, while the archi-
tectural detailsare Greek 3 and judg-
ing from the number of columns and
the style of the interior, it seems to
have been erected at a time when
Christianity was under the special
protection of the imperial government.
Pococke supposes it tobe of the time
of the Empress Helena. Over the
door on the desert side is a cornice
ornamented with Corinthian foliage,
share which is a stone with square
dentils, both of red granite; and
over the door, at the end of the
entrance passage, is another block of
red granite with Doric triglyphs
and guttie. The area within, which
answers to the nave of our churches,
and of the old basilicas. had on either
side about l4 columns, mostly of red
granite, with various capitals of a
late time. One of the Corinthian,
and another of the Ionic order, ap-
pear to be of a better age.

At the east end is the choir, con-
sisting of two separate parts, sur-
mounted by domes, the innermost
being dirided into three coupart-
ments, before the central one of which
is a screen with some miserable re-
presentations of St. George. Here
are several Coptic inscriptions, in one
of which i read " Athanasius the
Patriarch," the rest being much de-
faced.

On three sides of this building,
and at a short distance from it, I ob-
served the remains of brickwork.
which lead me to suppose it was once
surrounded by an outer wall: and
perhaps the present building was only
the church of a monastery formerly
attached to it. which seems also to
be the opinion of Denon.
