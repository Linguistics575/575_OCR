the several regiments of Egyptian in-
fantry, with a corps of their allies,
under the command of three other of
these princes, marching in regular
stepandintheclosearrayo '-
ciplined troops, accompany their king.
He arrives at Thebes, and presents
his captives to Amunre and Maut,
the deities of the city, who compliment
him, as usual, on the victory he has
gained, and the overthrow of the ene-
my he has “trampled beneath his
set."

On the north wall the king presents
oﬁ'erings to different gods, and below
is an ornamental kind of border, com-
posed of a procession of the king’s
sons and daughters. Four of the
former, his immediate successors, bear
the asp or basilisk, the emblem of
m 'esty, and have their kingly ovals
ad ed to their names.

Passing through the centre door,
on the inner or north side of this cor-
ridor, you arrive at the site of the
hall. On either side of the en-
trance the king is attended by his
consort, who, as usual, holds the sis-
trurn, but her name is not introduced.
Some of the chambers at the back
part of the building remain, and may
be visited by descending amidst the
masses of crude-brick walls which en-
cumber them; but the greater pert
are entirely buried and concealed.

If the sculptures of the area arrest
the attention of the antiquary, or ex—
cite the admiration of the traveller,
those of the exterior of the building
are no less curious in an historical
point of view, and the north and east
walls are covered with a profusion of
the most varied and interesting sub-
jects.

At the north-east extremity of the
end wall a trumpeter assembles the
troops, who salute the king as he
passes in his car. In the that com-
partment on the east side, Remeses
advances at a slow pace in his chariot,
attended by fan-bearers, and preceded
by his troops ; and a lion running at
the side of the horses, reminds us of

the account given of Osymandyaa,
who was said to have been an-

eompanied in war by that animal.
Another instance of it is met with at
e’ Dsyr, in Nubia, among the sculp-
tures ofthesecondRemeses. Second
compartment: — He continues his
march, his troops leading the van,
and a trumpeter summons them to
form for the attack. Third compart-
ment: —The Reba await the Egyp-
tian invaders in the open ﬁeld; the
king presses forwards in his car, and
bends his bow against the enemy.
Several regiments of Egyptian archers
in close array advance on different
points, and harass them with showers
of arrows. The chariots rush to the
charge, and a body of Asiatic allies
maintains the combat, hand to hand,
with the Reba, who are at by“
routed, and ﬂy before their victorious
aggressors. Some thousands are left
dead on the ﬁeld, whose tongues and
hands being cut 01?, are brought by
the Egyptian soldiers as proofs of
their success. Three thousand ﬁve
hundred and thirty-live hands and
tongues form part of the registered
returns; and two other heaps and a
third of tongues, containing each a
somewhat larger number, are de-
posited nnder the superintendence of
the chief ofﬁcers, as trephies of vic-
tory. The monarch then alights
from his chariot and distributes re-
wards to his troops. In the next
compartment the king’s military
secretaries draw up an account of the
number of spears, bows, swords, and
other arms taken from the enemy,
which are laid before them; and
mention seems to be made in the
hieroglyphics of the horses that have
been captured.'

Remeses then proceeds in his car,
having his bow and sword in one
hand and his whip in the other, indi-
cating that his march still lies through
an enemy‘s country. The van of his
army is composed of a body of
chariots; the infantry in close order,

 

preceding the royal car, constitute
