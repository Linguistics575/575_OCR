The general effect of this grand
ediﬁce is exceedingly imposing, and
from the state of its preservation it
is capable of giving a very good idea
of Egyptian temples. It also shows
the respective proportion and distri-
bution of the different parts; their
exterior appearance when entire; and
the strength of those formidable ci-
tadels; which, while they served asa
protection to the town, commanded
the respect of the inhabitants, and
effectually prevented or defeated any
attempts of the disaffected to dis-
pute the authority of their priestly
rulers.

The god Hor— Hat, who is the same
as Agathodcmon, so frequently re-
presented by the winged g obe, is the
deity of Edfoo; and we learn from
the small temple (which was one of
those buildings attached to the prin-
cipal edifice, called by M. Champol-
lion “mammeisi, or lying-in cham-
bers "), that Athor, the Egyptian
Aphrodite, with the god Hot-Hat,
and their son Hor-senet-to, “ Horus
the support of the world,” or “ of
the two regions (of Egypt)," formed
the triad worshipped in this city. But
the honours paid to the crocodile by
Ombos, Silsilis, and other neighbour-
ing towns, were, if we may believe
Straho, never acknowledged by the
inhabitants of Apollinopolis.

The small temple was also erected
by Ptolemy Physcon, and Lathyrus,
and consists of two chambers, with a
peristyle of pillars. It had an area
in front, which has lately suffered
from the depredations of the Turkish
miners; though the stones quarried
from it still remain unused, a counter
order having been received to stop
the erection of the manufactory, for
which this temple has been so unne-
cessarily disﬁgured.

In a low hill, between two and
three miles to the south-west of Ed-
foo, appear to be some grottoes,
which I did not visit.

Arabs; and another portion of the
tribe is settled at Des-6w, above
Ombos.

Halfway from Edfoo to Gaul
Silsileb is a ruined town on the east
bank, once fortiﬁed with a wall,
ﬂanked by round towers, not of very
ancient date, and apparently through-
out of Arab construction. It up
have been the site of another Pithom
or Toum, the ancient Thrnuis 8
though this should be halfway be»
tween Edfoo and Ombos. Thmuis
is evidently the Tooum of Ptolemy,
who places it inland, 14’ north of
Ombos, and 25’ south of Eilethyas.
Some suppose 'I‘hmuis to be the same
as Silsilis. Halfway between this
fortiﬁed place and Touab is a grotto
in the rock.

Hdgar Sast'leh ; Silsilis. — At
Hégar, (or GébeL) Silsilelt — the
“ stone,” or “ mountain of the chain,”
are extensive quarries of sandstone,
from which the blocks used in the
greater part of the Egyptian temples
were taken. The Arabs account for
the modern name by pretending that
a tradition records the steppage of
the navigation of the river at this
spot by a chain, which the jealousy
of a king of the country ordered to
be fastened across it. The narrow-
ness of the river, and the appearance
of a rock resembling a pillar, to
which the chain was thought to have
been attached, and the ancient name
Silsilis, so_ similar to the Arabic
Silsileh, doubtless gave rise to the
tradition; and the Greek Silsilis was
itself a corruption of the old Egyp-
tian name, preserved in the Coptic
Golgi.

0n the eastern side of the Nile,
and near the commencement of the
quarries, stood the ancient town of
Silsilis, of which nothing now re-
mains but the substructions of a stone
building, probably a temple. On
this bank the quarries are very ex-
tensive, but less interesting to the
antiquary than those on the west;
