saems to be of a Caesar, the ternple
has an appearance of greater an-
ty than the generality of those in
Oases; but I could ﬁnd no re-
d a town; and it is possible
this temple was intended merely
add sanctity tothe site of the
g, and to ensure its protection.
The ﬁrst object of interest, on
entering the Oasis of El Kh‘rgeh on
that side, is a camber-ism, consisting
of a large arched chamber, pierced
with small cells for cinerary urns,
capable of containing the condensed
residue of numerous burnt bodies.
It measures shout 17 ft. by 8 l't., and
about 20ft. in height. Beyond it
are other ruins and tombs; then
another columbarium, and a tower
about 40“. high, in which were once
separate stories, the lower rooms
arched, the upper ones having had
roofs supported by rafters. The tower
p a well, and was probably
an outpost for soldiers. About one
third of a mile to the north of this,
and S. E. of the columbarium, are
the remains of another tower and
ruined wells; beyond which is another
ruin of crude-brick with an arched
roof, ands door in the Egyptian style.
Hall‘s mile further are other crude-
brick ruins on the hills, and an old
well about 50 ft. in diameter. About
a mile beyond, to the south, is the
Kasr Ain e' Sent, “ the palace (or
castle) of the Acacia fountain," so
called from a neighbouring spring.
It consists of about 80 rooms and
passages, with staircases, leading to
the upper part, and the exterior is
ornamented with the Egyptian cor-
nice. It is of crude-brick, and pro-
bably of Roman time; and in the
wall facing the well a stone niche or
doorway has been put up in the
midst of the brickwork. for what pur-
pose I could not discover. being
some distance from the ground. In
one of the rooms are some Coptic in-
scriptions. There are other ruins
near this, all a little out of the direct
road to the town of El Khdrgeht

Eyypt.

end beyond are some tombs, one of
which is ornamented with pilasters,
end a pediment over the enhance.
From the fountain, or Ain e' Sent, to
the great temple of El Kh‘rgeh, is
about one mile end a uarter, or to
thetown about three mtes. Onthe
way, end shout half a mile to the leﬂ,
you pass the NecrOpolis, which I
shell mention presently.

The great (We of El mime}
is much larger than any in the Cases,
and is an interesting monument. It
was dedicated to Amun, or Amunre;
and it is worth of remark that the
ram-headed has here the same
name as the ong-l'eathered Amun of
Thebes. In explanation of this I
must observe, that we are not to look
upon the ram-headed god es Amun,
but to remember that it is Amun who
has assumed the heed of a ram, in the
same way as he takes the form of
Khem. or any other god. The cus-
tom wns common to other deities of
the Egyptian Pantheon, who her-
rowed each other‘s attributes without
scruple; and it was this his assump-
tion of an attribute of Kneph, par-
ticularly in the Oasis, that led to the
error of the Greeks and Romans,
in representing Amun with the head
of a ram,as ageaernl form of that
deity.

The sculptures of the tetnple are
not of the spirited style of the early
Pharaonic ages ; though some are by
no means had, particularly on the
transverse wall separating the front
from the back part ofthe portico. In
the sdytum the ﬁgures are small, and
the subjects very extraordinary, pro-
bably of Ptoleme'lc or lloman tune,
when extravagant emblems took the
place of the more simple forms of an
earlier period.

The oldest name I met with was of
Darius. which occurs in many places;
and on a screen before the temple
is that of Am rtaua There are
also several 0 inscriptions on the
front gateway or pylon. one of which.
