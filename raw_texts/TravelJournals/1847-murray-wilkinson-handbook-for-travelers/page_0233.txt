possd to mark the site ofefourth
pyramid, did not Herodotus, by men-
tionin three only, prove that none
es there in his time. Near this
faceof the great pyramid are three
trenches of considerable size, which
some have supposed to be intended
for misin the mortar; thareereelso

ﬁrst pyramid, the object of which it
not easy to determine. The rock
uts abounds in nummulites
and other fossil remains, common, as
Pliny 'ustly observes, in the moun-
tains 0’ the African chain, but which
Strabo supposed to be the petriﬁed
residue of the barley and lentils of
the workmen. Lentils, no doubt,
constituted their principal food, to-
gether with the three roots, ﬁpl,
onions, and garlic mentioned by He-
rodotus, all of which are still in com-
mon use among the lower orders of
Egyptians; and when we see the
errors of the present day, we readily
forgive the geographer for his fanci-
ful conclusion. The nummulite is
the Nautilus Mammilla, or Lenticu-
laris.

Respecting the due of the yrs-
mids, it is very evident that ero-
dotus is far from right, when he
places Cheops (or SuPhis) after Ma-
ris end Sesostris, who were kings
of the 18th dynasty. It may, how-
ever, be observed, that though Re-
meses the Great corresponds to 8e-
sostris, there was an older Pharaoh of
this name, mentioned by Manetho in
the 12th dynasty, which has led to
the mistakes made by Greek writers
respecting this king. it is probable
that the pyramids are the oldest mo-
numents in Egypt, or, indeed, in the
world, and that the kings who built
them reigned some time before the
age of the Osirtasens and the l6th

dynasty. But whether the overned

absence of monuments in the The-
haid of that remote period. I have
supposedthedateofthegreat pyra-
mid,or the reign of Sophia, to be
about 9190 s.c.; but this is a con-
jecture, which remains to be con-
ﬁrmed or refuted by future disco-
veries. Atellevents,tbeopinionof
those who conclude, from the pyra-
mids not bei mentioned in the
Bible,and by omer,that theydid
not exist before the Exodus, nor at
thetimeofthe poet,istotallyin-
admissible; and we may, with equal
readiness, re' thee-"tion of those
wboprete that the Jews aidedin
their construction.

With regard to the opinion that
those kings were foreigners, -
ments may be found bothto ate
and supportit. The style ofacrhi-
tecture, the sculptures in the tomhg
and the scenes they represent, are all
Egyptian; and there are no subjects
reletin to another race, or to cus-
toms 3iﬂ‘ering from those of the
country. On the other hand, the
aversion stated by Herodotus to have
been felt by the Egyptians for the
memory of their founders, if really
true, would accord with the oppres-
sion of foreign tyrants; other stran-
gers who ruled in Egypt employed
native architects and sculptors; and
it is remarkable that, with the excep-
tion of the ephinx, Campbell‘s tomb.
and a few others, the pyramids and
the monuments about them are con-
ﬂnedtonearlythesemeperiod. But
however strong the last may appear
in favour of a foreign dynasty, it must
be remembered that all the tombs of
Beni Hansen were in like manner

or three reigns; and many other
cemeteries seem to have been used
for a limited time, both at M
and other pieces.
