nerally with the Meadyneh. This
is the same tribe to which those of
Wadee el Arab belong, who live
about Sabooa in Nubia.

Emsayna, to the east of Mount

livin with the Meadyneh, ori-

And at the northern parts of the
peninsula the Heywat, the Teéaha,
and the Tarabéen.

An idea of travelling with one
tribe through a desert belon ing to
another, when they are not on riendly
terms, should never be entertained.
There is another disagreeable thing
to which travellers are sometimes ex-
posed. Two parties of the same
tribe quarrel for the right of con-
ducting him; and after he has gone
some distance on his journey, he and
his oods are taken by the opposition
can idates, and transferred to their
camels. The war is merely one of
words, which the inexperienced in the
language cannot understand; but he
fully comprehends the annoyance of
being nearly pulled. to pieces by the
two rivals, and his things are some-
times thrown on the ground, to the
utter destruction of every thing fragile.
This should also be provided against,
before starting, and a shekh or guide
should be secured who has decided
authority, and can overawe all par-
ties. But all should be done with
perféct good humour; and there is
every advantage in securing the good-
will and friendly understanding with
the Arabs, on whom so much of the
comfort of a journey necessarily de-
pends. It can of course be better
done if the traveller speaks Arabic;
and I can safely say I never had a
disagreement of any kind with any
Arab, but have always met with
good humour and willingness to oblige
on every occasion.

shins may he bou ht at Cairo, and if
new, should be til ed and emptied fre-

quently to rid them of the di la
taste they give to the water. A tent
should also be bought at Cairo. A

single-poled tent is the best. Extra
ropes are useful, as well as a double
supply of pegs and mallets. A Mac-
intosh sheet, or canvas, for dam
ground (brought from Europe), and
warm covering are requisite, as well as
wax candles, lamps, mishmish (dried
apricots), maccaroni, rice, and other
provisions. Some charcoal is useful
for the ﬁrst part of the road: you after-
wards ﬁnd suﬂicient fuel in the val-
izs. An extra supply of coﬁ'ee and

res tobacco, to give the Arabs oc-
casionally, will be found useful; and
a Mantels, or water-bottle of Ru
sia leather, to suspend from your sad-
dle, and the Shebbehelt rope-nets for
packing baggage on the camels, are
of service. The water-shins should
be placed on these last, and never on
the ground, which often contains much
salt.
