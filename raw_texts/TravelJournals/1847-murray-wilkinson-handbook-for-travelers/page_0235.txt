mound,” to the N. E., is evidently
ancient ; and another stood just above
the two he a, or hamlets, to the south
of Rom-e Aswed. A Greekinserip-
tion found before the sphinx speaks
of “ the inhabitants of the village of
Busiris in the LGtopolite name, who
live near the pyramids, the scribes of
the district and the scribes of the
village (the and the

), dedicating the stone
dale" on which it was inscribed ; —a
sufﬁcient proof that Busiris was close
to the pyramids, and fartherto the N.
than the modern Abooseer, which
stands beyond the limits of the [Ato-
polite, and within the Memphite,
name. It has succeeded to the name,
though not to the site, of the ancient
village; nor is this the only instance
of the Arab form of the Egyptian
word; and Abooséer is the modern
name of Busiris in the Delta, near
Sebennytus, and of Bush-is, the sup-
posed Nilopolis, near the Heracleo-
polite nome.

about one mile to the N. of Abooséer
are the pyramids to which it has given I

other vestiges of masonry, now a heap
of broken fragments of white stone.
Fifty pacestothe E.ofthenorthern-
most pyramid of Abooséer, is a
temple, and a causeway leading from
ittotheplain; and some distanceto
the 8. of this is another causeway
leadin to the central pyramid, at the
side 0 which lie fra ments of black
stone that once per it.

Besides the pyramids are 8 or 9
other stone ruins, one of which, to
the S. W. of the large pyramid. is 78
paces by 80, with an entrance on the
N. It has perpendicular sides, and
some of the stones measure nearly 17
feet in length. In thelargest of these
pyramids the degrees, or stories, are
exposed, the triangular portions that
ﬁlled up the spaces having been re-
moved. It measured originally, ac-
cording to Colonel Vyse, 359 feet 9
inches square, and 227 feet 10 inches
high, now reduced to 325 feet and
164 feet. The northernmost one is
surrounded by an enclosure 137
paces square; the pyramid itself being
about 213 feet s1uare, or 216, ac-
cording to Colone Vyse, having been
originally 257 feet; and its height
of 162 feet 9 inches is now reduced
to 118.

about 2970 feet, or, according to

building it, probably taken from an
older monument, is the name of
one of the early Pharaohs.
In the plain below are the
remains of a stone building,
apparently a temple, con-
nected with the pyramid by

 

a causeway ; and about half

way between this and the -

the “ many pyramids on the brow of
hills" mentioned by Stnbo, in which
he included no doubt those of Geeaeh,
Abooseer, Saigigira, and Dashdor.
The largest pyramid of Salghira has its
degrees or stories stripped of their
triangular exterior. It measures
about 137 paces square ; or, according
to Colonel Vyse's measurements, 351
feet 2 inches on the N. and 8. faces,
and 393 feet ll inches on the E. and
W.. and is surrounded by what may
be considered a sacred enclosure, about
1750 feet by 950 feet. Within, it re-
sembles a hollow dome, supported
here and there by wooden rafters.
