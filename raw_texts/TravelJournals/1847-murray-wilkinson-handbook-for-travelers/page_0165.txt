anrawan, near Tunis, the capital of
the Fowdtern, to invade Egypt; and
being succeeded in conquering the
montry. be founded a new city, near
the citadel of gunﬁre, under the
name of How el ﬁsherah. This in
362 (a. n. 973) became the capital
instead of Pastas; which then, by
way of distinction, received the name
of Musr el Ateékeh (old Musr).

El ”031 soon afterwards arrived
with the whole of his court, and the
Fow‘tem, bringing with them the
bonesol' their ancestors, for ever re-
linguished the country whose so-
vereignty they had also usurped, and
which they still retained, by leaving a
viceroy in the name of their mo-
narch. Cairo was at ﬁrst called Dar
el Memlehelt. or “the royal abode,"
and then Musr el lgsherah; and
Fostat was distinguished ever after
by the name of Musr el Ateél_teh, or
old Musr, which has since been
transformed by Europeans into old
Cairo.

The epithet Balterah (Cairo) is de-
rived lrorn ﬁsher, and signiﬁes “ vic-
totious."

The ﬁrst part of the city erected
by Géher was what is still called el
liastiyn, or “ the two palaces," one
of which, lortnerly the residence of
Saladin and other kings, has been
long occupied by the Mt’thltemeh, or
Cadi's Count. Till within a few
years it was almost a ruin, but is now

The walls of Cairo were built of
brick, and continued in the same state
till the reign of Yoosel' Saléh-e'odeen
(Saladin), who substituted a circuit of
stone, and united to the oniginal town
the whole of that part lying between
the Bah Zonsyleh and the citadel.

founder of the l'liyoobite dynasty in

history of the Crusades under the
name of Saladin. Shortly before his

arrival, and during the troubles that
obscured the latter end of the reign
of the Fowatem, whom he espelled,
Cairo had been attacked by the Franks,
and partly burnt on their approach,
about the year 1171. Their designs
against the city were unsuccessful;
but in order to place it effectually
beyond the reach of similar attempts,
Saladin raised around it a stronger
wall of masonry; and observing that
the elevated rock to the south of the
city offered a convenient position for
the construction of a fortress, to com-
mand and protect it, be cleared and
walled in that spot; and discovering
a large well near the centre that ha
been cut by the ancients, and was
then ﬁlled with sand, he excavated it,
and brought another welcome sup~
ply of water to the citadel by an
aqueduct, which conveyed a con-
tinuous stream from the Nile, at
Fostat, to the new citadel. This last
was then merely a conduit, sup-
ported on wooden pillars; and it
was not till about the year 1518 that
the stone aqueduct, still used for the
same purpose, was substituted by
order of Sultan el Ghorée.

it is probable that the well above
mentioned, which now been the name
of Beer Yoosel', “ Joseph‘s well," from
the caliph Yoosel‘, was hewn in the
rock by the ancient Egyptians, like
the tanks on the hill behind the
citadel, near the :5th el “own;
and this is rendered more probable
from the circumstance of there having
been an old town, called Loui-
Tlteslnémi, on the site of the modern
city. It seems, indeed, to be gene-
tally allowed by the Cairencs, that
Yooscf was not the real author of this
great work; and some have claimed
it, without much show of probability,
for Amer, the first Moslem con-
queror of Egypt. It consists of two
parts, the upper and lower well, and
a winding staircase-leads to the bottom,
a depth of about 960 feet. The
exact part of Cairo occupied by the
Egyptian town is uncertain; but we
