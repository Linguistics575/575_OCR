casing,“ the esprenion of Herodotus,
lihethatappliedby Pliny tothethird
pyramid, does not require the granite
eatend beyond the surface. That

'te was employed for some portion
atle-tofthaouterpartorcasin of
tide pyramid, is suﬂciently proves by
the blocks that lie scattered about its
h-e,among which I observed scanner-
The stones used in the body
ofthis,aswell asalltheotherpyra-
mids. have been brought partly from
the nummulite rocks of the neigh—
bouring hills, partly from the quarries
of the “ Arabian mountain," on the
oppositeside of the river; and the
casing stones or outer layers were
com of blocks hewn from its
compact strata.

This mountain is the Troici lapidis
mom of Ptolemy and Strabo; and it
is to it that Pliny alludes when he
says, “ the largest pyramid is formed
of blocks hewn in the Arabian quer-
riea.” The mountain is now called
Gebel Miserah, from a town below
on the river; and the compound name
Toora-Misarah is sometimes applied
to it, from another village to the N.,
which, though bearing an Arabic
name, signifying “ a canal," has every
appearance of having been corrupted
from the ancient Trojs, or Vicus
Trojanus. From this the hill was
called Troici lapidis room.

The ascent of the second pyramid
over the casing is difﬁcult. In my
ﬁrst visit to these monuments, in teen,
before the real meaning of Ilemdotus's
statement occurred to me, I went up
to the summit of it, in order to ascer-
tain something relative to its com-
mencement from the top 3 I need
scarcely say without being repaid for
the trouble. My ascent was on the
W. face, which I either supposed to
batheeasit-st, on looking at it from
the round, or probably from what I
had before, being entirely alone

when I went up. There is some
diﬁculty in getting upon the pro-
jectingcasing, which greatly overhangs
the other part below it; and in de-
scending over its smooth face, it
requires a good head, as in looking
down between your feet you see the
plain below, while searching for a
footing in the small holes cut here and
there to mess steps. These, how-
ever, have lately been made larger and
more numerous. The portion of the
casing that remains extends about one
quarter of theway from the present
summit of the pyramid ; and Colonel
Vyse calculates it at from 130 to 150
feet, which I suppose to mean along
the inclined face. 0n the top is a
level space, the apex being broken
away ; and on one of the stones is an
Arabic inscription, of which I regret
I did not take a copy, though it pro-
bably contains little more than a
record of the ascent of some one ra-
ther more ventnresome than a Cairene.
I mention this in case any of my
readers should have an opportunity
of copying it; at the same time that I
recommend those who attempt the
ascent to take off their shoes.

The passages in the second pyramid
are very similar to those of the ﬁrst;
but there is no gallery, and they lead
only to one mam chamber, in which
is a sarcophagus sunk in the ﬂoor. It
is remarkable that this pyramid had
two entrances; an upper one, by which
you now enter, and another about 60
feet below it, which, though nearly
cleared by Belsoni, was only com-
pletely latd open by Colonel \‘yae.

Like all the others, it had been en-
tered by the Arabs and re.closetl ;and
when Belaoni opened it in 1816, he
found, from an inscription in the
chamber, that it had been visited be-
fore by Sultan Ali Mohammed,
whose order it was probably re-cl .
The Arabic is as follows: —
