which, according to Mr. Salame‘s1

interpretation is, “The Master Mo-
hammed son of Ahmed, mason, has
opened them; and also the Master
0thman was present; and the king,
Ali Mohammed, from the beginning
to the closing up.” Professor Lee
gives it, “ The Master Mohammed,
son of Ahmed, the stonecutter, ﬁrst
Opened them; and upon this occasion
were present El Melek Othman, and
~the Master Otbman, and Mohammed
Lu leilr. " If this were the correct
rea ing , the openin of the second
pyramId would be red to the year
lQOO, during the short reign of El
Melek el-Asées-Othman, the second
son and immediate successor of Sala-
din; but it is not borne out by the
copy given by Belsoni, which is very
correctly translated by Mr. Salame;
the es ression “closing up " being
alone oubtful.

The opening of the second pyramid
was highly creditable to the enter-
prising Belsoni; not from the mere
employment of a number of men to
seek or force a passage, but because
the prejudices of the time were so
strong against the probabillty of that
pyramid containing any chambers.

One hundred and thirty feet from
the mouth of the upper passage was
a granite portcullia , and the other
was closed' In the same manner about
100 feet from its entrance. A little
beyond the latter portcullis is a long
narrow chamber; and the passage is
afterwards united with the upper one
by an ascending talus. The dimen-
sions of this pyramid are —

It stands on higher ground than
the great pyramid, and has, when seen
from certain positions, the appearance
of greater height. An area sunk in
the rock runs round its northern and
western face, parallel with the pyra-
mid, distant from it on the N. 200,
and on the W. 100 feet. In the scarp
of the rock to the W. are a dosen
tombs, in one of which (the 6th from
the S.) the ceiling Is remarkable, the
stone being cut in imitation of palm
tree beams, reaching from wall to
wall. This shows that the houses
of the Egyptians (when the arch was
not preferred) were sometimes so
roofed, as at the present day; the
only difference being, that the beams
were close together, while' In modern
houses they are at some distance from
each other, with planks or layers of
palm branches, and mats across them.
And the latter was no doubt the
usual mode of placing the beams with
the ancient Egyptians also.

This tomb Is the third from the line
of the S. W. angle of the pyramid,
going northwards along the face of
the rock.
