of remark between Mansoéra and
Damietta.

Damietta or Deming, once famous
as the principal emporium on this
side of the Delta, has sunk in im-
portance, in proportion as Alexandria
has increased, and now only carries
on a little commerce with Syria and
Greece. Its rice and fisheries, how-
ever, enable it to enjoy a lucrative
trade with the interior. It was once
famous for its manufacture of leather
and striped cloths, which last. when
imported into Europe, received from
it the name dim'ry. The houses are
well built, though inferior to those of
Rosetta; and the town is one of the
largest in Egypt, with a population of
98,000 souls.

Damietta is known in the history
of the Crusaders as the bulwark of
Egypt on that side, and its capture
was always looked upon as the most
important object in their expeditions
against that country. Aboolfeda says
“it stood on the shore, where the
river runs into the sea; until the
danger to which it was exposed, from
the Franks, induced the Egyptian
caliphs to change its position; and
the modern town was founded higher
up the Nile, about ﬁve miles further
from the sea.” According to Abool-
feds, the old Damietta was destroyed.
and the inhabitants were transferred
to the village of Menshé'e'h, which
was built in its stead, and which after-
wards succeeded to the importance
and name of the ancient town; and
Michaelis, on the authority of Nie-
buhr. says Mcnshé'éh is the name of
one of the uares, or pieces, of the
modern Damietta. The time of this
change of position. and the destruc-
tion of the old town are fixed by
Aboolfeda in the year of the lleglra
648 (a. o. 1951). 'l‘heold Damietta
had been walled round and fortiﬁed
by hlotawukhel, the tenth of the
Abbaside celiphs (about a. n. 050):
and the new town was built by Be -
hers, the fourth sultan of the
Memlooks.

Damietta was Tamiathis, and the
many antique columns and blocks
found in the present town have pro-
bably been brought from its ruins.
They are principally in the masks;
andon a slab used for the ablutions
of the faithful, in the mask of Aboo~
lita, (a short way outside the town,
on the east.) is a Greek inscription
with the name of Tennesus.

Other Thane in the Delta—The
sites of many interesting towns exist
in the Delta which are little known,
but which would probably repay the
curious traveller for the trouble of a
visit. Few ruins of consequence
might reward his research; but the
discovery of the name or figure of a
deity on the fragment of a temple. or
the exact position of the mounds,
might enable him to determine the
town they below to, and make us
betteracquaint with thesncientgeo-
graphy of a district now imperfectly
known. The sites, too, of Buto, of
the Isle of Helbo, and many other
places of note mentioned in history,
are of no less interest to the geogra-
pher than to the antiquary.

Near the centre of the Delta is
Tanta, well known for its ﬁles in
honour of Sayd Ahmed el Beddowee.
n Moslem saint of great renown. He
was born at Fe: in a.n. 596 (a.o.
1900), and having passed through
Tanta, with all his family, on his way
to Mecca, established himself in that
place on his return, and was buried
there at his death.

These ﬂm are celebrated twice a
year; one at the beginning of March,
and the greater fits. during the inun-
dation, a little before the canals are
cut. Both are attended by an immense
concourse of Moslems, who perform
a sort of pilgrimage to the tomb of
this holy personage. Some have
stated their number to be ISQW;
and, as at the festival of Bubaatla, in
old times. a greater quantity of wine
