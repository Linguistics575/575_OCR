along the western face of the cliﬂ's,
you come to a tablet of Remeses ”1..
receiving the falchion from the hand
of the crocodile-headed god Sarah, or
Savak-Rgin the presence of Amun;
and.beyond this is a large oval, the
source of the same Pharaoh.

lteturning thence to the south side
of the isolated rock that stands above
the town, you perceive, at the upper
part of it, two figures in high relief,
each holding a horse. They represent
two Roman emperors (rather than
Castor end Pollux, as some have
imagined), and between them ap-
pears to have been another figure,
perhaps of a god.

The base of this hill is perforated
with tombs, some of which have Greek
inscriptions, with the names of their
owners. At the door of one I ob-
served a Roman ﬁgure standing be-
fore an altar, who holds in one hand
some twigs, and apparently presents
incense with the other. Within is
the same person and his son before
four gods, but without hieroglyphics;
and the architecture of the grotto is
more Roman than Egyptian. It was
closed as usual with folding-doors,
secured by a bolt. There is also a
ﬁgure of the god Nilus bringing
offerings and a bull for sacriﬁce.

In one of these tombs is an en-
chorial inscription much defaced;
and some have mouldings and orna-
mental devices of Roman time.

Near the abovednentioned grotto,
and below the isolated rock overhang-
ing the town, is a niche of Roman
time, with the remains of a mutilated
ﬁgure in relief within it; and on
either side of it is this Creek in-
scription, -—

which shows that people made mis-
takes in orthography in those times
as at the present day. About 700
feet to the south of this isolated met
one other gruttoes; then a small

mountain summit to the south-west,
you come to some curious trenches
and workings in stone. During the
ascent you pass some crevices in the
rock, incrusted with a thin deposit of
crystallised carbonate of lime, here
and there assuming astalaetitic form;
and besides the nummulitea that
abound there, I observed a nautilus
about six inches in diamcter, and
other fossils.

The trenches at the top of the hill
are curious, from their showing a
peculiar mode of opening a quarry,
and hewing square blocks of stone;
another instance of which is met with
near the N. W. angle of the second
pyramid of Geeseh. They began by
levelling the surface of the rock to
the extent admitted by the nature of
the ground, or the intended size of
the quarry, and this space they sur-
rounded by a deep trench, formin a
parallelogram, with one of its si es
Open, to facilitate the removal of the
stones. They then cut other parallel
trenches along its entire length, about
seven or eight feet apart, and others
at right angles to them, until the
whole was divided into squares. The
blocks were then cut off according to
their required thickness. One ofthe
quarries of Téhneh has been divided in
this manner, and the outer trenches
of two others have been traced, even
to the depth of 9| feetin parts, t
their direction is less regular than tn
the former. in this the trenches are
about i} and 9 feet broad, and the
squares measure from 6 to 7 feet 1
inch each way; the who e length of
the quarry bein 126 feet by 39 feet
in breadth; an so conveniently is it
pieced, that the stones, when separated
from the rods, were rolled down to
the valley beneath. without the trouble
of carriage. The division into squares
enabled them to take off a succession

‘ of blocks of the same dimensions;

and layer after layer was removed,

according to the depth of the quarry,

which continued to be worked down-

wards, as long as the rock remained
