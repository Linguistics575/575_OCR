against the Reba, and for the march
of Remeses to their country after the
defeat of that people; which might
at ﬁrst sight appear to present some
difﬁculty.

In the nest compartment, the king
distributes rewards to his victorious
troops; and then proceeding to Egypt,
he conducts in triumph the captive
Rebo and Tochati (Tokkeri?) whom
he offers to the Theban Tried, Amun,
Meat, and Khonso.

In the compartments above these
historical scenes, the king maltes
suitable oﬂ‘erin gs to the gods of Egypt;
and on the remaining part of the east
wall, to the south of the second pro-
pylon, another war is represented.

In the ﬁrst picture, the king
alighted from his chariot, armed with
his spear and shield, and trampling
on the prostrate bodies of the slain,
besieges the fort of an Asiatic enemy,
whom he forces to sue for peace. In
the next he attacks a larger town
surrounded by water. The Egyptians
fell the trees in the woody country
which surounds it, pt obahly to form
testudos and ladders for the assault.
Some are already applied by their
comrades to the walls, and while they
reach their summit, the gates are
broken open, and the enemy are
driven from the ramparts, or pre-
cipitated over the parapet by the
victorious assailants, who announce by
sound of trumpet the capture of the
place. In the third compartment, on
the north face of the ﬁrst propylon,
Remeses attacks two large towns, the
upper one of which is taken with
little resistance, the Egyptian troops
having entered it and gained posses-
sion of the citadel. In the lower one
the terriﬁed inhabitants are engaged
in rescuing their children from the
approaching danger, by raising them
from the plain beneath to the ramparts
of the outer wall. The last picture
occupies the upper or north end of
the east side, where the king presents
his prisoners to the gods of the
temple.

SecLIV.

OF T113338.

The western well is entirely covered
by a large hieroglyphical tablet, re-
cording various oﬂ‘erings made in the
diﬂ‘erent months of the year by
Remeses Ill. The head and tore-
part of several lions project, at in-
tervals, from below the cornice of
the exterior of the building. whose
perfOrated mouths, communicating
by a tube with the summit of the
roof, served as conduits for the rain
water which occasionally fell at
Thebes. Nor were they neglectful
of any precaution that might secure
the paintings of the interior from the
effects of rain, and the joints of the
stones which formed the ceiling being
protected by a long piece of stone,
let in immediately over the line of
their junction, were rendered im-
pervious to the heaviest storm. For
showers fall annuaﬂy at Thebes; per-
haps on an average, four or ﬁve in
the year; and every eight or ten
years heavy rains ﬁll the torrent beds
of the mountains, which run to the
banks of the Nile. A storm of this
kind did much damage to Belsoni's
tomb some years ago.

Square apettures were also cut at
intervals in the roofs, the larger ones
intended for the admission of light,
the smaller probably for suspending
the chains that supported lamps for
the illumination of the interior.
