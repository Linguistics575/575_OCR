which include breakfast, dinner, tea,
and a bedroom. A sittin -toom is
charged extra, as well as wines, beer,
wax candles, coﬂ'ee, &c. The cuisine
is good, and the landlord and atten-
dants civil.

The prices at the other hotel are the
aame. At Coulomb's you meet with
much civility ; and his rooms at the
Orient are by no means bad.

It is less easy to ﬁnd good rooms,
or houses “to be let," at Alexandria
than at Cairo; and they are much
dearer.

3. Sxavanrs. -- Native and other
servants may be engaged at Alex-
andria, or Cairo, for the voyage to
Upper Egypt, or for a residence at
those places, at the following rate :—

Turkish Cawass, or Kawias (Chow-
ish), improperly called Janissary, 1
dollar a day or 80 dollars a month;
Italian, French, German, or Greek
servant, 20 to 30 ; Maltese, 12 to 20.
Native servant speaking Italian, or
other Eumpean languages, 12 to 20;
Native man cook, 5; Cook and ser-
vant of all work. 6; Native servant
speaking very little Italian, 3 to 8;
Native servant speaking only Arabic,
from 55 to 60 piastres. (These are
all fed by their master.) Sci: (Siis)
or groom, 85 piastrea, and keeping
himself.

Turks and natives resident at A lex-
andria or Cairo pay much less, and
at the latter place they seldom give
their servants more than from 10, or
even less, to 20 piastres. But they
are very badly dressed, and have often
a miserable appearance, unless clothed
by their masters. (See Sxavart-rs at
Cairo, sect. 2. c.)

4. Boas-s. —- Boats are engaged at
Alexandria for the voyage to Cairo,
at from 225 to 275 piastres; with
a small fee to the captain. if he be-
haves well. When taken to Att'eh
only the price is about 100 piastres.
' Those who prefer the steamer, may
take a place from Alexandriato Cairo
for 31. 10s. ; but it only goes occasion-
ally. The voyage by a steamer cc.
