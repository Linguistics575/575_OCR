d. It takes from 32 to 38 hours to
go from Cairo to Sues on a camel,
and 14 to 20 on a dromedary; and
the ordinary time allowed for those
who are conveyed by the Company
(and now by the Egyptian Govern-
ment) is about 19 hours.

Vans go quicker, and in winter
those with 4 horses holdings persons,
or three with light carpet bags, take
from 14; to 16 hours. They profess

station, independent of the ﬁrst set of
horses taken from Cairo, and the
charge is 61. for each person, from
Cairo to Sues, including accommoda-
tion and provisions, without wine.
Donkeys, or donkey litters, take from
30 to 50 hours. The for a
litter with 3 donkeys and men is 300
piastres, or 3!. 3 a donkey is rated at
16a., and camels or dromedaries are
charged 12s., or 60 piastres each.

Between Kalaiat Raiin and Wadee
Halasénee is much petriﬁed wood.
I observed a palm tree from 25 to 80
feet long, and other wood in the sand-
stone rock. The Wadee Halasonee,
or the “ valley of snails,” is so called
from their abounding there, as indeed
throughout this part of the desert.
But they are not found to the south
of let. 99° 20’.

The small Acacia tree, called Dar
el Hamra, “ the red house," or Om e'
Sharaméet, “ the mother of rags," is
the spot where the pilgrims rest on
their way to Agerood; and near this
is the principal station (No. 4.) of
the passengers by the overland route.

Eobbet e' Takréore is a tomb built
by the friends of an African stranger
who died there, and a little beyond it
is Beer el Batter, a “ well ” only in
name, having no water, though many
attempts were made to ﬁnd it there
some years ago.

There is no fresh water on the Sues
road, except after abundant rains in
the Wadee Gendelee, { a mile to the
left of the road, and alsoin the Wadee
Jaffra, into which the Gendelee runs
not far from where the road crosses
it. Near Beer el Batter the lime-
stone roclrs reappear, and the petriﬁed
wood ceases with the sandstone.

The plain of El Muggreh is the
highest part of the road. To the east-
ward of it all the vallies flow towards
the sea, and to the westward towards
the Nile; and here the Derb e’ Tara-
been joins the “ road of the Pilgrims."
About 8 miles further, and about 2
miles short of El Muktala, is the
course of an ancient road, the stones
