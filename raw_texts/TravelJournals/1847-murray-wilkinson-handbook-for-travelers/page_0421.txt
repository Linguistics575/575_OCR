have supposed; but of the countries
mentioned in the sculptures. it is
auﬂiciently interesting to ﬁnd asub-
ject illustrating so completely the
description of the Jews and their
taskmaaterv, given in the Bible; with-
out perverting the truth, to give them
additional importance.

Othersare employed in heating a
liquid over a charcoal ﬁre, to which
are applied,on either side, a pair of
bellows. These are worked by the
feet, the operator standing and press-
ing them alternately, while he pulls
up each exhausted skin by a string
he holds in his hand. in one in-
stance the man has left the bellows,
but they are raised, as if full of air,
which would imply a knowledge of
the valve. Another singular fact is
learnt front these frescoes—their»
quaintance with the use of glue—
whieh is heated on the ﬁre, and
spread, with n thick brush, on a level
piece of board. One of the work-
men then ap lies two pieces of diffe-
rent colou wood to each other, and
this circumstance seems to decide
thatglue is here intended to here-
preseoted, rather than a varnish, or
colour ofany kind.

On the opposite wall the attitude
of n maid-servant pouring outsome
wine to a lady, one of the guests. and
returning an empty cup to ablark
slave who stands behind her, is ad-
mirably portrayed; nordoes it oﬂ'cr
the inE' position of an Egyptian
ﬁgure. And the manner in which
the slave is drawn, holding a plate
with herarm and hand reversed. is
very characteristic of a custom pecu-
liar to the blacks. The guests are
entertained by music, and the women
heresit apart from themen. Several
other subjects are worthy of notice
in this tomb; among which may be
mention a garden (on the right
hand wall)whera thepersonageofthe
tomb is introduced in his boat. towed
