Berenice, and to Philaters, just men-
tioned; one from Contra Apollino-
polis (opposite Edfoo).to the emerald
min- of Gehel Zahara; and another
from Philotera along the sea-coast to
the Leucos Portus, Necbesia, and
Berenice, which continued thence
southwards in the direction of Sowe-
kin. There was also one, which left
the Nile near Contra Apollinopolis.
and taking a southerly direction, ran
probably to the gold mines (of Gebel
Ollagee). mentioned b Agatharcides
and other authors, a subsequently
by the Shereef Edrisi and Aboolfeda.
They were generally furnished with
stations, built at short intervals, where
a supply of water could always be ob-
tained, by means of large well: sunk
within them to a great depth, and
frequently in the solid rock. From
these spacious cisterns were ﬁlled, as
well for the use of the soldiers quar-
tered there,as of those who passed;
and hence the name of “Fons,” or
Hydra-o."

The gold ntincs lie some distance
to the south of the Ababdeb deb
aert, in the territory of the Bisha-
ré'eh. They are,as Edrisi and Abool-
feds observe, in the land of Beggs,
the Bisharee country; and, as ep-

from two of the Arabic funeral
Inscriptions found by Mr. Bonomi
and Monsieur Linant, were worked
in the years 339 a. n. (95l a. 1).),
and 378 s. u. (989 A. n.), the former
being the ﬁfth year of the Caliph
Mostukfee Billih, a short time before
the arrival of the Fatemitcs in Egypt;
and the other in the fourteenth year
of El Ase-es, the second king of the
Fate-mite dynasty. Certain it is, how-
eeer, that they were also mined pre-
vious and subsequently to that period,
though there are no other epitaphs
with dates.

The stations on the road m Cup-
tos to Bernice have a pecu iar inter-
est, from being mentioned by Pliny,
and the Itinerary of Antoninus.

The above distances of one station
to another agree pretty well with the
measurements I took, in surveying
this part of the country, as may be
seen in my mapof Egypt, which ea-
tends to about thirty miles south of
Berenice. Besides all those stations
mentioned in the Itinerary, an inter-
mediate one between Didyme and
Afrodito is metwith. on the direct
road from Coptos to Berenice, about
four and it half milesto the north-
ward of the latter. At Afrodito I
found a Latin inscription, on turning
over the fallen lintel of the door,
which begins with a date. unfortu-
nately erased; and I found that the
llydreuma and Vicus Apollinis were
distinct, standin a short distance
from each other, It different of
the valley. The Norum an Vetus
Hydreuma are the last stations before
reaching lierenice, tbelatter being out
ofthe read. about four miles up a
valley.
