my people at ill-st; once 1 conqne them
and they did me honour, and I made peace
with them, and they swore to me by their
idols. and I believed their oath that they

There was also a Latin inscription,
on a stone lying amidst the rains in
the area, but now removed, I believe,
to England. It was an acrostic re-
cording the name of "Julii Faustini ;"
but notnithstanding its mention of
Apollo, Minerva, and the Muses, was
evidently written in defiance of " gods
and columns.”

A short distance from the temple,
towards the north-west, are the sand-
stone quarries, from which the stone
used in building its walls was taken ;
and on the hill behind it are found
the scattered bones of mummies. In
the village are the remains of walls,
and among some fragments there I
observed a Dot ic frieze, with ox's
heads in the metopes, and a cornice
of Roman date.

The ancient town stood on the
north and south of the temple, and
extended along the hill towards the
Bayt el Wellee, which is strewed
with bricks and broken pottery.

It is not without considerable
satisfaction that the Egyptian anti-
qunry turns from the coarse sculp-
tures of the Roman era to the chaste

tures of Remeses II. at the Baytel
Wellee, “ the house of the saint,” I.
small but interesting temple excavated
in the rock, and dedicated to Amunre,
with Kneph, and Anouke. It con-
sists of a small inner chamber or
adytum; a hall supported by two
polygonal columns of very ancient
style, which call to mind the sim-
plicity of the Greelt Doric; and an
area in front. At the upper end of
the hall are two niches, each contain-
ing three sitting ﬁgures in high re-
lief; and on the walls of the area,
outside the hall, are sculptured the
victories of Remeses ; casts of which
are in the British Museum.

The sculptures telate to the wars
of this Pharaoh against the Cash or
Ethiopians, and the Shorii, an East-
ern nation, apparently of Arabia Pe-
traea (certainly not the “ Bishari ”);
who having been previously re-
duced by the Egyptian monarchs,
and made tributary to them, rebelled
about this period, and were recon-
qucred by Osirei and the second
Remeses. On the right-hand wall
the monarch, seated on a throne un-
der a canopy or shrine, receives the
offerings brought by the conquered
Ethiopians, preceded by the Prince
of Cush, Amunmatapé, who is at-
tended by his two children, and is
introduced by the eldest son of the
conqueror. Rings and bags of gold,
leopard-skins, rich thrones, ﬂabella,
elephants' teeth, ostrich-eggs, and
other objects, are among the presents
placed before him; and a deputation
of Ethiopians advances, bringing a
lion, oryx, oxen, and gaselles. The
lower line commences with some
Egyptian chiefs, who are followed by
the prince of Cush and other Ethio-
pians, bringing plants of their coun-
try, skins, apes, a cameleopard, and
other animals. Beyond this is repre-
sented the battle and defeat of the
enemy. Remeses, mounted in his
car, is attended by his two sons, also
