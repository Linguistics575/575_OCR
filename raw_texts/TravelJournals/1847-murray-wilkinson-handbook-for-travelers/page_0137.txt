Necmpolia. Pocoche observed in it 1
four rows of columns from 8. to W.,
and onerowontheother sides; and
here, he says, it is supposed that the
church of St. Mark once stood;
where the patriarch formerly lived;
and where the Evangelist is reported
to have been put to death. This
church was destroyed by the Moslems
in the reign of Melelt el Kernel, the
son of Meleh Adel, in 12l9, whilst
the Crusaders were besieging Dami-
etta. for fear that they might surprise
Alexandria and make a fortress of its
solid walls; and no oﬂ‘ers on the part
of the Christians could induce them
to spare this venerated building. The
other great mosh is called ofSt. Atha-
nasius, doubtless, as Pococke absence,
from having succeeded to a church
of that name. It is from this that
the nrcophagus, called the “ tomb
of Alexander,” was taken, which is
now in the British Museum.

has a small theatre. The actors are
Eumpeans, and all amateurs, with
the exception of the priraa doaaa.
Tickets of admission may be ob-
tained by strangers, not residents,
gratis, as at Cairo.

During the carnival. many private
and public balls are given ; the latter
at the Casino. There is also a read-
ing-room, with a library. at the cor-
ner of the Frank square, to which
access may be had, on application to
a member.

Few objects worthy of a visit can
be mentioned in the modern town.
Thosewho are interested in Egyptian
antiquities will he gratiﬁed by seeing
the collection of S. D'Anastasy. the
Swedish consul-general, and a smaller
one with some rare medals belonging
to Mr. Harris. As they are both
strictly private, an introduction is
required to obtain permission to visit

The former is approached through a
small garden; and, after ascending a
substantial staircase in the Turkish
style, you reach the upper rooms.
which are occupied by the Pasha
during his residence in Alexandria.
They are not remarkable for any
splendour, and the whole is ﬁtted up
in a simple manner. partly Turkish
and partly European. The large
circular room is handsome. with an
English chandelier suspended in the
centre, over a round table. Though
the Pasha's bed-room partakes of an
European character, he prefers his
old custom of having his bed upon
the ﬂoor, to what we should consider
the more comfortable mode of raising
it on a bedstead. It is in the middle
of the room, and a frame-work sur-
rounding it supports a mosquito cur-
tain.

Near this is an Italian drawing-
room, and in another are the portraits
of Ahmed Bey, ason of Ibrahim Pa-
sha, and of the three younger sons of
Mohammed Ali. The dining-room
is small, with an inlaid wooden ﬂoor.
The bath is neatly titted up with mar-
ble. There is a billiard-room, where
the Pasha frequently amuses himself
by playing. and by seeing the suc-
cess or disappointment of others, In
which he appears to take great de-
light. The rooms and passages are
covered with ﬂoor-cloth of ordinary
quality, made in the arsenal. The
view looking over the portis striking.
and particularly so when the ﬂeet is in
harbour, which is best seen from the
balcony.

The arsenal is only interesting to
those who wish to see the manner in
which that and similar establishments
are conducted in Egypt; but a visit
to some of the ships of ear would re-
pay any one, whois curious about the
rapid formation of a ﬂeet and navy,
with the imperfect means afforded by
the country. On going to the Pasha‘s
