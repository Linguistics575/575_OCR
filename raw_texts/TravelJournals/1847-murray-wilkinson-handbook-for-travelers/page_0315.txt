alter the Trojan captives of Menelaus,

with what probabili it is dimcult
now to decide; some ancient
Egyptian name of similar sound is
as likely to have been changed by the
Greeks and Romans into Troja, asby
the modern Arabs into Toora. The
mountain to the eastward is evidently
the Troici lapidis mans, or 1'

ms of Ptolemy and Strabo; and
from it was taken the stone used in
the casing of the pyramids. It is totbe
some mountain that Herodotus and
Diodorus allude, when they say the
stone for building the great pyramid
came “ from Arabia," or the eastern
side of the Nile. ‘

The quarries are of great extent;
and that they were worked from a
very remote period is evident from the
hieroglyphic tablets and the names of
kings inscribed within them. Those
to the north, to which a railway has
been laid down by the Pesha, are
sometimes distinguished by the name
of the quarries of Toora, those to the
south, of Miserah. At the former
are tablets bearing the names of
Amun-E-gorimf Amunoph ll. and
UL, and of Neco: at the latterare
those of Amea. Amyrtzus, Acoris
(llakori), and Ptolemy Philadelphus
with Anino’é; and some have the
ﬁgures of deities, as Athor and Thoth,
and the triad of Thebes—Amun,
Maut, and Khonso—without royal
ovals. in one of the tablets at the
quarries of Migarah, sculptured in
the 22nd year of Ames or Amosis,
the leader of the lath dynasty, who
ascended the throne in 1575 a. c., is
the representation of a sledge hearing
a block of stone, drawn by six oxen.
The hiereglypbie inscription above
this is much defaced; but in the
legible portion. besides the titles of
the king and queen “beloved of
l’thah and Atmoo,” we read “in the
22nd year of his beloved mejeuy the

They ﬁrst began by a trench or
groove round a square space, on the
smooth, perpendicular face of the
rock; and having pierced n hori-
aontai shaft to a certain distance, by
cutting away the centre of the uare,
they made a succession of mllar
shafts on the same level, alter which
they extended the work downwards
in the form of steps, removingewh

reached the lowest part, or intended
door, of the q . A similar proce-
was adopted on the oppositeeide, in the
same face of the rock, till at length
two perpendicqu walls were lel't,
which marked thetestent of the quarry;
and here again, new openings were
made, and another chamber, connected
with the other, was formed in the same
manner; pillars ofrock bein lehhere
