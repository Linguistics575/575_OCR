learn from Arab writers that two
villages existed there, before the
time of Géher, one called el Malta,
where the Copt quarter now stands,
and the other Euttaeea.

The best way of going to the
Citadel is on asses, but ladies will
ﬁnd the sedan chairs at the hotel very
convenient for this excursion.

Besides the well just described, the
citadel contains several objects worthy
of a visit; among which may he
mentioned the Pasha's palace, the
new mosh, now building by Mo-
hammed Ali, the site of Joseph’s
hall, and the arsenal.

The palace contains some hand-
some rooms, and the view from it is
'very ﬁne.

The moslt is still far from being
ﬁnished. It consists of an open
squtne, surrounded by a single row
of columns, 10 on the N. and 8.,
18 on the W., and 12 on the E.,
where a door leads to the inner part,
or house of prayer; as in the Tay-
loon, and other moslts of a similar
plan. The columns have a fancy
capital supporting round arches, and
the whole is of Otiental alabaster,
with the exception of the outer walls.
Of the general appearance and effect
no Opinion can be formed fiom a
building in so unﬁnished a state; but
I fear it will not have the beautiful
character of the old masks of Cairo,
and that it will be rather admired
for the materials than the style of
its architecture. Beyond it is the
hareem of the Pasha, with a rden
on the aide nearest the mos . it
was to make room for this moslt that
Joseph’s Hall, a lofty building sup-
ported on numerous handsome granite
columns, was removed in 1829. But
it is to be regretted that the careless-
ness, or want of skill, in taking down
the columns, caused the destruction
of the greater part of them, being
thrown down at once, and mestly
broken by the fall. Some few are

still standing in their original p0.
sition, but will, of course, soon be
talten away, and probably share the
fate of their companions.

From the platform is a grand and
commanding view of the city and
the surrounding country, talting in
the arsenal immediately below, —-
the Roomaylee, and the splendid
moslt of Sultan Hassan, just outside
the gates of the citadel,—the nu-
merous minarets of Cairo, —attd, in
the distance, the Pyramids, — with
the valley of the Nile, to Sakhﬁra on
the south, and to the point of the
Delta on the north.

Parts only of the old citadel walls
now remain, the others having been
replaced by bastions and curtains of
European construction; and, what
strikes a stranger, the portion most
strongly and regularly fortiﬁed is that
least open to foreign aggression, the
town side. A great patt of the walls
was blown up by the explosion of the
powder magazine, in 1823, but all was
restored the same year, and since that
time some additions have been made
to the works.

The spot a little to the north of
the Rooméylee gate is where Emin
Bey escaped, during the well-known
massacre of the Memloolts, by leaping
his horse over a gap in the then
dilapidated wall. But independent
of that opening, a large mound of
rubbish had accumulated below from
the fallen materials, and it is to this
that his safety must principally be
attributed.

On the western wall of the citadel
is an eagle in high relief, supposed to
be an emblem. or banner, of Kara-
ltoosh, the minister and buﬂ‘oon of
Yoosef-Salah e’ deén, whose name
signiﬁes itt Turkish, “eagle " (or
“ black-bird ”). It has no inscription,
but is evidently of the same date as
the wall into which it is built; and
the credulous believe that it formerly
uttered a cry when any calamity was
about to happen to the city.

Behind the citadel is a fort upon a
