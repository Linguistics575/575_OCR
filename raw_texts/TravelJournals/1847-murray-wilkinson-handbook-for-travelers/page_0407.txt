figures in the lower line are of the
god Nilus.

In the succeeding chamber are
rudders and sacred emblems; and
the principal ﬁgures in the last are
two harpers playing on instruments
of not inelegsnt form before the god
A0, or Hercules. From these the
tomb received its name. One (if not
both) of the minstrels is blind.

Each of these small apartments has
a pit, now closed, where it is pro-
bable that some of the oﬂicers of
the king's household were buried;
in which case the subjects on the
walls refer to the station they held;
as, the chief cook, the superintendent
of the royal boats, the armour-
hearer, the stewards of the house-
hold. and of the royal demesne, the
priest of the king, the gardener,
hierephoros, and minstrel.

The subjects in the ﬁrst passage,
after the recess to the right, are
similar to those of Net l7., end are
supposed to relate to the descent to
Ameuti ; but the figure of Truth, and
the other groups in connection with
that part of them, are placed in a
square niche. The character of the
four people, in the ﬁrst hall, differs
slightly from those of the former
tomb; four blacks, clad in African
dresses, being substituted instead of
the Egyptians, though the same name,
Brit, is introduced before them.

Beyond the grand hall of the ser-

sages, in the last ofwhich are benches
intended apparently for the same pur-
pose as those of the lateral chamber
