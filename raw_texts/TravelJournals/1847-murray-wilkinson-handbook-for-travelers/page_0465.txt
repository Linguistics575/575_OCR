This extensive building consists of
e neos, portieo, end eres. The neos
is divided into three successive chem-
bers, -—the edytum, e hell supported
by two columns, end e third room
opening on the portieo, which hes
twelve columns, three in depth and
four in breedth, the front row united
byscreens on either side of the en-
trenee. The eree is termineted by
the pyremidsl towers of the propylon.

two wells of circuit, both of which
ere joined to the propyion. The
spece between them is occupied by
sererel chambers. end et the upper
extremity is a smell building with
columns, forming the eree to e cine.

Though the introduction of the

end other pieces in Nubie, would
eﬂ'ord little interest to the
reeder, end would perheps be outol’
piece in e work like the present, I
think the ﬂourish of King Silco too
curious to be omitted.

The Greek of King Sileo is not
very pure, nor very intelligible; some

I therefore leere the lee reeder
