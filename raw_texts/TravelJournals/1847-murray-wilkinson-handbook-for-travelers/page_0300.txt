behind of crude briclt, stuccoed and
painted in squares and ﬂowers. Nine-
teen paces in front of it is a stone
gateway, the entrance to the area in
which it stood. There are also some
large crude brick buildings orna-
mented with pilasters, apparently of
Roman-Egyptian time; within which
are vaulted chambers of sandstone.
Many of the houses of the town re-
main, mostly vaulted and stuccoed;
and the streets may easily be traced.
A little more than one mile from this
are other ruins, called E1 Easr e1
Aréeseb.

Near Ballat is a ruined town called
Beshéndy. The houses were vaulted
and stuccoed, and the principal build-
ing seems to have been a temple, of
crude brick, with the Egyptian ovals
and cornice. The doorway is arched,
and it is evidently of Roman time.
Teneéda is a ruined village of Arab
time, which has long been deserted:
but, as the land about it is very good,
serious thoughts are entertained by
the people of Ballat of colonising it,
and rebuilding the houses.

The condition and population of
this Oasis are very superior to those
of the other two; and in spite of the

better inhabited than the second," or
Web e’ Dalthleh, it is erident that
the latter was always more populous.
and always contained a ter num-
ber of villages. Indeed in the Oasis
Parva there are only 4 — Zubbo,
and Mareeh, or Mendeesheh, El
liar, and Bowitti ; whereas Dakhleh
contains 11, and a pnpulation of
more than 6000 male inhabitants.
The remains, too, of ancient towns
and villages far exceed any that the
former can boast, and prove its supe-
riority in this respect at all times.

Dakhleh abounds in fruits, par-
ticularly olives and apricots; but
dates, as in all the Oases, bring the
principal revenue to the district. At
El gear is a warm spring, whose
copious stream supplies several baths
attached to the moslt, for which its
temperature of 102° Fah. is well
adapted. The people are hospitable,
anal consequently differ from those of
the Oasis Parva; nor are they so
ignorant and bigoted as the latter, or
as those of Farafreh.

The general position of the Oasis
of Dakhleh is N. and S. in the di-
rection of a line passing through Bl
Kasr to Kalaméon, and thence E.
towards Ballat; its extent north-
wards measuring about 15 miles, and
E. and W. about 28. Much rice is
grown in this, as in the other Oases,
particularly about Mootand Misarah:
but it is very inferior to that of the
Delta, the grain being small and
hard.
