already reached a warmer climate.

On several ofthe heights aresmall
towers. particularly on the east bank;
and here and there are quarries of
sandstone once worked by the ancient
Egyptians.

About a quarter of the way from
Ombos to Asouan, some maps mark
Roman ruins on the east bank.

The junction of the enadetoae and
granite is observed about two-thirds
of the way from Ombos to Asouan,
in the vicinity of El Khattara; from
which point the former continues at
intervals to present itself over the
syenite, and other primitive beds, as
at Asouan and in Nubia.

Three miles south of this village,
and on the west bank. is an isolated
hill, in which are a few quarries; and
near the river are the remains of a
staircase, and vestiges of building.
