Lethyrus have usurped a place among

the sculptures of the
monarch.

Passing these towers, you enter
another court, 60 feet long, on either
side of which stood a row of nine
columns, with a lateral entrance to
the right and left. The jambs of one
of these gateways still remain. They
are of red granite, and bear the name
of Petamunap, who, if he be the same
whose extensive tomb lies in the
Assaseef, probably lived under the
twenty-sixth dynasty, and was a per-
son of cat consequence and un.
usual agileuoe, of the priestly order,
and president of the scribes. He was
deceased at the time of its erection.

The corresponding door is, like
the rest of the ediﬁce, of sandstone,
from the quarries of Silsilis. This
court may be called the inner vesti-
bule, and to it succeeds the original
ediﬁce, composed of an isolated sanc-
tuary, surrounded on three sides by a
corridor of pillars, and on the fourth
by six smaller chambers.

The original founder of this part
of the building was the monarch who
raised the great obelisk of Karnak;
Thothmes 11. continued or altered
the sculptures; and Thothmes ”I.
completed the architectural details of
the sanctuary and peristyle. To
these were afterwards added the
hieroglyphics of Remeses Ill. on
the outside of the building, to con-
nect, by similarity of external ap-
pearance, the palace-temple of his
predecessors with that Ire erected in
its vicinity. Some restorations were
afterwards made by Ptolemy Phys-
con; and in addition to the sculp-
tures of the two front doorways, he
repaired the columns which support
the roof of the peristyle. liakdris,
second king of the twenty-ninth
dynasty, had previously erected the
wings on either side, and with the
above-mentioned monarchs he corn-
pletes the number of eleven, who
have added repairs or sculptures to
this building.

turns to the north along the east face
of the mounds, and appears to have
enclosed the whole of the m
surrounding the temples, and to bare
united to the east side of the front
tower of the great temple. Close to
the tank is a brolten statue, bearing
the ovals of Remeaes IL, and of
Taia, the wife of Amunopb lll.,
his ancestor; and several stones, in-
scribed with the name of this Re-
meses, have been used in the con-
struction of the gateway of Lathyrus
and the adjoining towers.

Great Tanpfs at Hdeéut Hana.—
l nest proceed to notice the great
temple-palace of Renreaes Ill. The
south part consists of a building once
isolated, but since united by a wall
with the towers of the last-mentioned
temple, before which two lodges form
the sides of its spacious entrance. In
front of this stood a raised platfortt'r:

similar to those met with before the
dromos of several Egyptian monu-
ments. Aﬂer passing the lodges
you arrive at a lolly building, re-
sembling a pyramidal tower on either
hand, between which runs an oblong
court,terminated by a gateway, which
passes beneath the chatnbers of the
inner or north side. The whole of
this ediﬁce constituted the pavilion of
the king; and in addition to several
chambers, that still remain, several
others stood at the wings, and in the
upper part.which have been destroyed.

private apartments are the more inte-
