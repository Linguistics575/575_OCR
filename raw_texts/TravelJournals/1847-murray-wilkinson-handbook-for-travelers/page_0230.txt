Egyptian. Pliny says it measured
from the belly to the highest point of
the head 68 feet, its length was 143,
and the circumference of its head
round the forehead 102 feet; all cut
out in the natural rock, and worked

In the perpendicular face of the
low rock, behind the sphinx, are the
remains of tombs, one of which, dis-
covered in 1820, by Mr. Salt, had
an interesting representation of Osi-
ris and its deceased inmate, named
Pet-pasht, or Petuhastes.

About 180 feet behind this rock
is a very curious tomb, discovered
by Colonel Howard Vyse, and called,
aﬁer our consul-general, “ Campbell's
tomb.” It consists of a large square
pit out in the rock to the depth of
53 feet 6 inches, and measurin 30
feet 6 inches east and west, an 26
feet 8 inches north and south. The
massive circuit of rock, in which the
pit is cut, is surrounded by a large
trench 68 feet square, and 73 feet
deep; and in the space between the
trench and the pit are a passage lead-
ing to the latter, and two other small
pits, from one of which a sarcopha-
gus, now in the British Museum, was
taken. The large pit is not in the
centre, that is, equidistant on all sides
from the trench, but about 2] feet
from it on the south, about half that
on the north, and about 9 feet on the
east and west. In the large pit is a
cofﬁn of black basalt, still in its place,
covered with a stone case or sarco-
phagus; over' which was raised a
stone arch of the time of Psamaticus
IL, which I regret to say has been
taken down, as I was told, by the
Shekh of Kerdassy, to build a water-
wheel. or some equally important work.
The whole of this tomb was very cu-
rious, and one feature was remarkable,
that thewalls ofthe arch stood onabed
of sand, about 2] feet thick; but for

In the high plain between this
and the great pyramid are several pits,
where sarcophagi are found, frequently
of black basalt; one of which, with a
lid in the form of the dwarf deity of
Memphis, Pthah Sokari, is still lying
on the ground above. Near it is the
pit where a gold ring, bearing the
name of Suphis, was ound, which is
now at Cairo, in the possession of Dr.
Abbott.

On three sides of the great pyramid
are the tombs of private individuals,
which Mr. Salt supposed to be of
the chief people of Heliopolis. They
are most numerous to the westward:
and in one of them marked Q, in my
plan, near the extremity of this ceme-
tery, are some interesting sculptures.
Trades, boats, a repast, dancing,
agricultural scenes, the farm, the
wine-press, and other subjects, are
there represented; and it is worthy of
remark that the butchers slaughtering
an as sharpen their red knives on a
blue rod, which would seem to indi-
cate the use of steel at this early pe-
riod. The name of Suphis (b) and an-
other Pharaoh occur in the sculptures,

There are also these names at the
tombs here, the ﬁrst of which (a)

Many of the
tombs have false
entrances, and
several have pits

tomb, as in the larger ones to the
