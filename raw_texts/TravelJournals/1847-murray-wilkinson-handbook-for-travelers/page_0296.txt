known as the Web el Mendéesheh,
and the Wah el GMrbes, though this
last is properly its “western” division.
The Arabic name Wall is the same as
the ancient Egyptian Ouah, Ana, or
0a, which with the Greek termina-
tion formed Auasis, or Oasis, and is
the Comic Ouahe.

The only ancient stone remains
are a small ruin near Zubbo, and a
Roman building in the town of El
Igasr, which has thence derived its
name, signifying “ the palace.” This
was once a handsome editice, well
built, and ornamented with Doric
mouldings; and its arch, with the
niches at the side, has still a good
eﬂ‘ect. The Easr el Alam, about ll
mile to the west of El Kasr, is an
insigniﬁcant crude brick ruin: there
is another about three quatters of a
mile to the south-west of the same
town, and to the east of Zubbo are
some rude grottoes.

The Little Oasis has several springs
of warm water, which, when left to
cool in porous jars, is perfectly whole-
some and palatable, though some say
it disagrees with strangers in the sum-
mer. The most remarkable are at
Bowitti and El Kasr, the former
having a temperature of 27° Reaum. ;
the latter, whose stream is converted
into a rude bath, of 27‘0 Reaum., or
about 93g° Fahr. With regard to the
real and apparent warmth of the water of
some of these springs, an idea may be
had from a pond formed by them at
Zubbo, whose water soon after sunrise
(Feb. 8.), the exterior air being 8&0
Reaum., was 18?, and quite warm
to the hand; at mid-day, the exterior
air being 15°, it was 21°, and cold to
the hand; and in the evening, at 9
r. at., the exterior air being MP, the
water was 20F, and consequently
warm to the hand ; explaining the ex-
aggerated phenomena of the fountain
of the Sun, in the Oasis of Ammon.
But I may add, that the pond, which
is about 30 feet wide, is not more
than 5 or 6 feet in depth. It is the
one mentioned by Belsoni.

In this Web are grown a variety of
fruit trees, much liquorice, rice, bar-
ley, wheat, doom, clover, wild cotton,
and most of the usual productions of
the Nile ; but the principal source of
wealth here, as in the other Oasis, is
the date tree, which yields a very su-.
perior quality of fruit.

The dates are of four kinds: the
Soltanee, the Saidee, which are the
best, the Kaka, and the Ertob (rot-
tub); but those of the Séewah are
even better. The proportion of fruit
tile? is also much greater than on the

t e.

A conserve of dates, celled Ag'weh,
is made by pounding them in a mass,
and then mixing whole dates with
it. The Sa'idee are preferred for this
purpose, and are preserved in earthen
jars, and kept by the natives'for their
own use; but some, which they put
into baskets, are sent to the Nile,
where they are highly and justly es-
teemed. They are very sweet and
rich, unlike any produced in Egypt,
and are sold at 5 or 6 dollars the
l_r_.antar.

They make no brandy from dates,
but extract a palm wine, called Lowb’-
geh, fiom the heart of the tree,—
an intoxicating beverage, of which
they are very fond. It is thus made:
in the summer, when the sap is up,
they cut 03' all the geré'ets (palm
branches), except three or four in the
middle; and then, having made inci-
sions in every part of the heart, at the
foot of those branches, they stretch it
skin all round, to conduct the juice
into a jar placed there to receive it.
Some palms till a jar in one night,
holding about six pints. It is sweeten-
ed with honey, and drunk as soon as
made; and its taste and effect are
very much like new wine, with the
ﬂavour of cyder.

The heart of the palm tree is also
cut out and eaten. But this, like the
process of making the wine, spoils
the tree. The people of the Nile,
therefore, never taste the former un-
less a tree falls, as they cannot afford
