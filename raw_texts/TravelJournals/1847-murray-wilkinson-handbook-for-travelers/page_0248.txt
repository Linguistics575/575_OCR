of communication with the Red Sea,
but at a subsequent period it fell into
disuse. and being neglected, was
choked up with sand, in which state
it continued till re-opened by the
Arabs in thecaliphate of Omar. This
prince was induced to send orders for
repairing it, on ﬁnding that the Holy
Land of Arabia had only been rescued
from the miseries of a famine by op-
portune supplies of corn from Egypt;
and Omar, to prevent the recurrence
of a similar disaster, resolved on re-
establishing this means of communi-
cation with the Red Sea. His anxiety
for the welfare of the Holy Cities was
welcomed with unbounded demon-
strations of gratitude from all ranks
of Moslems, as well as from the peo-
ple of Arabia itself; and Omar re-
ceived the ﬂattering title of “ Prince
of the Faithful" (Ameer el Mo-
meneén), which was thenceforward
adepted by his successors in the ca-
liphate. One hundred and thirty-four
years after, El Munsoor Aboo Gafer,
the second caliph of the Abbaside
dynasty, and the founder of Bagdad,
is said to have closed this canal, to
prevent supplies being sent to one of
the descendants of Ali, who had re-
volted at Medeeneh. Since that time
it has remained unopened; though
some assert that the Sultan Haltern
once more rendered it available for
the passage of boats, in the year a. n.
1000, after which it became neglected
and choked with sand.

But thou h the passage of boats
was imped , and it was no longer
of use for communication with the
Red Sea, some portion still contained
water during the inundation, until
closed by Mohammed Ali; at which
time it is said to have ﬂowed as far as
Shelth Haniydig and the bitter lakes.

With regard to the respective levels
of the Nile, the Red Sea, and Me-
diterranean, it has been ascertained
by the French thatthe Red Sea, at low
tide, is now 14, and at high tide 9
feet lower than the Nile at Cairo
during its inundation, and 30; feet

higher than the Mediterranean. But
besides therise'and fallof a tide of
fromst feet,“ must alsohe re-
membered that the Red Sea is some-
what lower in summer aﬁer the vernal
equinox than in the winter months.
when the prevalence of the south wind,
after the month of September, causes
a certain rise of its level.

ROUTE 8.
came 10 noun strut.

For the journey to Mount Sinai it
will be necessary to engage some of
the Tor Arabs, who will supply
camels, and act as guides through their
desert. As usual in these excur-
sions, one of them is to he the shelth
or chief of the party, the director of
all relating to the Arabs, and re-
sponsible for the protection of the
traveller.

To give some idea of the charges
ﬁ'equently made for camels, I will
give a few items of an agreement
made at Cairo, for the journey to
El A’lgaba.

“ I. From Cairoto El A’lpba, each
camel 21. 10s., or 250 piastres.

2. From El A’lgaba to Sues, 150
piastree.

3. From Sues to Daharé'éh, 150
piastres.

4. All the camels going to El
A’l_t_al1a to be paid for their return to
Sues.

5. The whole to be paid at Cairo
for the journey to El A’l_t_aba.

6. On returning to Sues, the
journey from El A’gaba to Sues to
be paid for there.

7. At Daharéiih the camels hired
at Sues to be paid for their return
thither.”

I must, however, observe, i. That the
charge for the camels is far too much,
and the payment beforehand should
never be a condition. But the Tor
Arabs have been spoilt by Euro-

eans; and the above hire of a camel
