Ethiopia; and this being hard and
diﬂcnlt to work, rendered its con-
Irnction more expensive. It is said
he the tomb of a courtesan, built
her lovers, whom Sappho the
calls Doricha, the friend of
brother Charasus,at the time that
he traded in wine to Naucratis.
Others call her Bhodope, and relate a
story that when she was bathing, an
min carried 03' one of her sandals,
having ﬂown with it to Mem-
phis, let it fall into the lap of the
king as he sat in judgment. Struck
by this singular occurrence, and the
buuty of the sandal, the king sent to
every partofthecountry to in nine for
its owner; and having foun her at
Nnucratis, he made her his queen,
and buried herat her death inthis
sepulchre." This Cinderella tale was
probably an invention of the Greek
quarter, after the time of Herodotus.
The geographer then mentions the
mounts of stone resembling lentils
barley (which he thinks very
likely tobe remainsof the workmen's
food), and the quarries of the Trojan
mountain, whence the stones were
broughttobuild the yramids. Close
to these quarries an to the river, he
adds, was “a village called Troja,
the ancient abode of the Trojan cap-

some state the reason of their erection
to have been either to deprive succeso
son or ambitious competitors of the
money, or to prevent the people be-
coming idle. Nor was this vanity
conﬁned to one person, and the traces
of many begun and leh unﬁnished

which bah ﬁlled the whole world
with their renown, are seen from a
greet distance by those who navigate
the river. They stand on the barren
rocky eminence on the Africanahore,
between the city of Memphis and
what is called the Delta, less than 4
miles from the Nile, and 6 from
Memphis, close to a village called
Busiris, where the people live who
are in the habit of climbing up them.
Before them is the Sphinx, even
more wonderful, and having the apo
pearance of a local deity of the nei h.
bouring people. They suppose ktng
Amasis was buried within it, and that
the whole was brought to the place
where it now stands, though in reality
it is cut out of the natural rock, and
worked smooth. The circumference
of the monster’s head is 102 feet
across the forehead, its length is 148,
and its height from the belly to the
highest point of the head 63 feet.

“ The largest pyramid is built of
stones from the Arabian quarries;
366,000 men are said to have been
employed for 90 years in its con-
struction; and the three were all
made in 68 years and 4| months.
Those who have written about them
are Herodotus, Euhemeruv, Duris of

temidorus, Alexander i’olyhlstor,
Butorides, Antisthenes, mmettius,
