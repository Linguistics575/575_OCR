by the Egyptians, though it is a sin-
gular fact that granite and other stone
used in their monuments, being gene -
rally coloured, could not be distin-
guished. The walls in the grottoes
at Beni Hassan are prepared as
usual for receiving the subjects re-
presented upon them by overlaying
them with a thin coating of lime, the

where the rock was defective
being ﬁlled up with mortar. But
they were contented to paint without
sculpturing the principal part of the
ﬁgures and hieroglyphics; and some
of the latter, in a long series of per-
pendicular lines round the lower
part of the walla of the second tomb,
are merely of one uniform green
colour. In each grotto are pits, in
which the dead were deposited, and
which are properly the tomb, the
upper part being rather the chamber
attached to this repository of the
body. Some of them are open, and
their position is fnguently pointed
out by a tablet o hieroglyphics,
placed immediately above, on the
side wall.

It is not my intention to give a
detailed account of the different
scenes introduced in these interesting
tombs; I shall therefore conﬁne my-
self to a few general remarks, be-
ginning with those to the north.

In the ﬁrst are represented various
trades; watering the ﬂex, and its em-
ployment for the manufacture of
linen cloth; agricultural and hunting
scenes; wrestling; attacking a fort
under cover of the testudo ; dancing ;
and the presentation of offerings to
the deceased, whose life and occupa-
tions are also alluded to. In one
place scribes register their accounts;
in another the bastinado is inﬂicted
unsparingly on delinquent servants;
nor is it conﬁned to men and boys,
but extended to the other sex, the
diﬂ‘crence being in the mode of ad-
ministering the stripsa. The former
were thrown prostrate on the ground.
and held while punished; the latter
sat, and were beaten on the shoulders.

With regard tothascribes, it may be
observed, that they are not, as gene-
rally supposed, taking an inventory
of the property of the deceased after
his denth,‘ but are represented en-
gaged in his service durin his life-
time; and his steward requently
presents him with the list ofthese
accounts, after they have been ar-
ranged by the scribes. Here his
We transﬁx, with stone-tipped
arrows, the wild animals of the
desert, and the mountains are re-
presented by the waved line that
forms the base of the picture. Some
are engaged in dragging a net full of
ﬁsh to the shore, others in catching
geese and wild fowl in large clap-
nets; in another part women play
thebarp; and some are employed
in kneading pasta and in making
bread.

In the next tomb the subjects are
equally varied, but the style of the
ﬁgures is very superior and more
highly ﬁnished; and it must bend-

the north corner, and particularly the
ﬁgure is spadiee, holding noon!
the anima s by the horns, are di

of the formality of an Egyptian draw-
ing; and the ﬁsh on the wall op-
posite the entrance are admirably ex-
ecuted. It is remarkable that the
phagm, or eel, is there introduced,
and apparently the two other sacred
fish, the oxyrhinchus and lepidotua.

A singular procession of strangers
occurs on the upper pant ofthe north
wall, who, from the hicroglyphlca
above them, appear to be captives.
M. Champollion supposed them to
be Greeks; but this opinion he af-
terwards renounced; and I only
mention it, as the authority of so dis-
tinguished a person is likely to mis-
lead. But who were they? Were
they Jews? and does this represent
the arrival of Joseph's brethren ? for
Joseph was, as I suppose, a con-
temporary of Osirtasen, in whose
time these tombs were excavated. I
do not pretend to decide, nor do I
