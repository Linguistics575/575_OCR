chambers below the front propyla
(B, 9.), and the small but complete
temple on the west side of this area
(marked 9.); the latter by Remeses
111., the former by his second pre-
decessor, Osirei ll.

Several sculptures were added,
during the twenty-second dynasty,
at the western corner of the same
area; and on the exterior wall, near
the doorway, are the names of the
captive towns and districts, which
the ﬁrst Sheshonlt (Shishah of the
Scriptures) boasted to have taken, in
his expedition against Jerusalem, ac.
97!. Among them is the Yooda-
Melchi, “ kingdom of Judah,"dis-
covered by Champollion.

The columns in this court, one
alone of which is now standing, hear
the name of Tirhska, Psamaticus 1.,
and of Ptolemy Philopator; and
the gateway between them and the
grand hall having been altered by
Ptolemy Physcon, additional sculp-
tures, bearing his name, were inserted
amidst those of the second Remeses
(at 6 and 7). On the left, as you
enter, he wears a Greek helmet.

These co umns, twelve in number,
stood in an avenue, six on each side:
we may however conclude, from the
breadth of the intercolumniations,
and the prOportionate smallness of
the columns, that they were never
intended to support a roof, nor even
architraves, but rather to bear hawks
or similar emblems.

0f the other monuments, origi-
nally detached from the main body of
the temple, the most ancient are the
south-west propyla, and a temple of
Amunoph III. (K), on the north-
east of the great enclosure. Other
names, in the different parts of this
building, are of Pthahmen, Remeses
IV., Amyrtaeus, Haltt'iris, and some of
the Ptolemies. It was once adorned
with elegant sculptures and two gra-
nite obelisks, but is now a confused
heap of ruins, whose plan is with difﬁ-
culty traced bieneath its fallen walls.

Sect. IV.

0" THEBBB.

In front of it stands a well-pro-
portioned pylon, bearing the names
and sculpturesof Ptolemi’ﬁuergelea
with Berenice, and of 'lopator;
beyond which an avenue of sphinx-
extends to a raised platform at its
north-east extremity. The pylon,
which was of a much earlier data than
the sculptures it bears, having attach-
ed to it the statues of Remeses IL,
is the only portion of this building
which has escaped the fury of the in-
vader; and though we may with rea-
son attribute a considerable part of
the destruction of Thebes to the Per-
sian conquest, the names on this
pylon, and many Ptolema'ic ad-
ditions to the temple of Amun,
fully prove that its capture by La-
thyrus was not less detrimental to
this city, than the previous invasion
of Cambyses.

A protracted siege of three years
had exasperated the Ptolema'lc con-
queror against his rebellious subjects;
and he sought, by the destruction of
Thebes, to wound the pride of its in-
habitants, w hi le he wrested from them
for ever the means and prospect of
future resistance.

The feeling which induced the Per-
sians to deface its monuments was of
a different nature. They had become
masters of Egypt; they were not
more inimical to the Thebans, than
to any other of the inhabitants of the
country; the destruction of the sta-
tues or the sanctuaries was prompted
by a contempt for their votaries, not
by the fury of an injured master; and
the pillage of all that was capable of
being removed, and the burning of a
captured city, were rather the custom
of the day than any extraordinary
severity exercised by the conquering
enemy. The Persians were hostile
to Egypt; Lathyrus was solely en-
raged against the Thebans ; and on
them the whole weight of his ven- ‘
geance naturally fell. And the sni-
mosity of civil war, inﬂamed by jea-
lousy against a neighbouring rival,

 

h prompted the Egyptian victors to de-
