having two entrances, one at the‘

pylon of Isis, the other at that be-
fore the great temple.

About 930 paces in front of the
pylon of Athor is an isolated hy-
pwthral buildin , consisting of H
columns, unit by intercolumnar
screens, with a door-way at either
end; and a shott distance to the
south are indications of an ancient
reservoir. A little to the N. E. of
it are other remains of masonry; but
the rest of the extensive mounds of
Tentyris present merely the ruins of
crude brick houses, many of which
are of Arab date.

Five hundred paces east of the
pylon of Isis is another crude-brick
enclosure, with an entrance of stone,
similar to the other pylons, bearing
the name of Antoninus Pius. Over
the face of the gateway is a singular
representation of the Sun, with its
sacred emblem the hawk, supported
by Isis and Nephthys. These two
“ sister goddesses" represented “the
beginning and the end," and were
commonly introduced on funereal
monuments, lsis on one side, Neph-
thys on the other of the deceased,
which might lead us to suppose this
enclosure to have been used for se-

ulchral purposes. The area within
t measures about 155 paces by 265 ;
and at the 8. E. corner is a well of
stagnant water.

The town stood between this and
the enclosure that surrounded the
temples, extending on either side, as
well as within the circuit of the
latter; and on the N. W. side ap-
pear to be the remains of tombs.
They were, probably, of a time when
Tentytis ceased to be a pepulous
city, and when a deserted part of it
was set apart for the burial of the
dead; a custom not uncommon in
Egypt, instances of which I have
already noticed at Bubastis and other
places.

of Dendera are some old quarries.

hill, about a mile to the N.W.of
them, in which are sunk numerous
tombs or the inhabitants or Tentyris.

It was in going over the Edger, or
plain of the eaert, in this direction,
that I observed numerous primitive
stones, evidently rounded by rolling,
and which, from their numberand the
extent of the space they are scattered
over, could not have been brought by
thehandofman; thou hmanyhare
been arranged in lines or some pur-
pose. They are of granite, porpbyry,
and other primitive substances, which
are only found in the interior of the
opposite eastern desert; and if not
brought by man, they must have been
carried across the present bed of the
river, and up the slope of tbewest-
erndesert, byarushofwatercoming
from the valley which opens upon
Keneh, and which, rising in the pri-
mitive ranges, hascut its way through
secondary hills, that border the valley
of the Nile. They are therefore
worthy the attention of the geologist.

Between the town and the edge of
the sandy plain to the south is a low
channel, which may once have been
a canal; and it is not improbable
that it was to this that the Tentyritee
owed their insular situation men-
tioned by Pliny.

The Tentyrites were profe-ed
enemies of the crocodile; and Pliny
relates some extraordinary stories of
their command over that animal.
The truth, indeed, of their courage,
in attacking so formidable an enemy,
appears to have been satisfactori y
ascertained; and Strabo afﬁrms that
they amused and astonished the Ro-
mans by their dexterity and boldnem,
in dragging the crocodile from an
artiﬁcial Ialte, made at Rome for this
purpose. to the dry land, and back
again into the water, with the same
facility. Other writers mention the
remarkable command they had over
the crocodile; and Seneca accounts
