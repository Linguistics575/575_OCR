 

XXX INTRODUCTION.

headless ﬁgures discovered there (now preserved in the Govern-
ment library at Valetta) in no way aid in solving the question.

In 6020 is another ruin called Torre dei Giganti, “ the Giants‘
Tower," inland on the eastern side of the island. which is on a
grander scale than the ruins of Crendi, though of similar construc-
tion, and evidently the work of the same people.

Rowing and sailing boats go over to 6010 from Valetta daily,
and sometimes a small yacht may he hired for the occasion, which
ls cleaner and more comfortable.

Valetta has a small theatre, where Italian operas are performed
during the season. Many public and private halls are also given,
particularly in the winter.
