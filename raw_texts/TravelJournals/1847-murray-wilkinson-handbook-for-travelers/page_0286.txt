Aﬂer passing Shebrement you fol-
low the ed of the desert, leaving
the pyrami of Abooseer, Sakkara,
and Dashoor on the right. El Kafr
is the best place to sleep at. A wealthy
ahekh lives there, called El Kitebeéree,
his ancestor having been the guide
(khehcer) to Sultan Selim, when
he conquered Egypt. Next morn-
ing you cross the low Libyan
hills to Tomfé'lt. 0n the east side
of that town is a ravine called El
Botts, 314 feet broad, dyked across
by a strong wall, which retains a
large body of water above it to the
south, for the purposes of irrigation.
Many dyltes existed there before,
all successively broken down by the
weight of the water, the ruins of
which are seen in the ravine below.
Some are apparently of Roman time.
About a mile from Tomé‘éh to the
south on the kanlt of this reservoir, is
Khm e’ Toob, “ the mount of brick."
It has no ruins except of crude brick
walls.

At Kafr Moltfoot, 4 miles from
Tomé'éh, on the road to Senoéris, are
some fragments of granite columns,
cut into mortars and millstones by
the Arabs, amidst whose deserted
huts the lie.

S is occupies the site of an
ancient town, but has no ruins.

Near Biahmoo are some curious
stone ruins. They consist of two
buildings, distant from each other 8!
paces, measuring 45 in breadth, and
about 60 in length, the southern end
of both being destroyed.

They stand nearly due N. and 8.,

and at the centre of the E. andW.
face is a doorway. In the middle of

each is an irregular mass of masonry
about 10 paces square, and about 20
feet hi having ten tiers of stone
remaimng in the highest part; and
at the north-east corner of the eastern
building the outer wall is entire, and
presents a sloping pyramidal face,
having an angle of 67°. Some have
supposed them to he pyramids, and
have seen in them the two mentioned
by Herodotus.

Much of the large Cyperus dives,
called by the people gush (Gush) or
Dees, is grown about Biahmoo, as in
many other parts of the Fyoém, for
making coarse mats and baskets. I
believe it is the largest species known
in Egypt, growing to the height of 5
or 6 feet, and has sometimes been
mistaken for the papyrus.

(At Medeeneh, called also Medeeaet
cl Fyoom, or Medeenet el Fires, are the
mounds of ArsinoiiJorinerly Crocodi-
lopolis, but no remains of buildings;
and the only variety to the desolate
heaps of rubbish are a gunpowder ma-
nufactory, a gihbet, and some Arab
tombs, all strangely connected with
death, on a desolate spot, once the site
of a populous city. I looked in vain in
some of the moslts at Medeeneh forre-
mains of sculpture or inscriptions : a
few columns of Roman time were all
they contained; hut in one of the
streets I saw a block with rich Ara-
besque scrolls, once belonging to some

man monument, and over it the
acanthus leaves of Corinthian pilssters.
On a red granite column, now the
threshold of a door, were two lines of
hieroglyphics, containing the name
of a town, and part of an inscription

that probably extended around the
shaft.

Medeeneh is a town of some im-
portance, and the residence of the
governor or nizer. It has the usual
bazaars of Egyptian provincial towns,
caravansarais, and baths, with a mar-
ket-day every Sunday. Leo Africa-
nus says, “ the ancient city was built
