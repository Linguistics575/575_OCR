another tomb, as also between Nos.
14. and 15.

No. 14. is of king Pthah-se-pthah,
or Pthahma Se-pthah, who seems to
have reigned in right of his wife, the
queen Taosiri; as she occurs some-
times alone, making oﬂ'erings to the
gods, and sometimes in company with
her husband. This catacornb was
afterwards appropriated by lting
Osirei II.,and againb hissuccessor,
whose name is met with throughout
on the stucco which covers part of
the former sculptures, and in iataph'o
on the granite sarcophagus in the
grand hall. In the passages beyond
the staircase the subjects relate to the
liturgies of the deceased monarch, and
in the side chamber to the left is a
bier attended by Anubis, with the
ratesof the four genii beneath it. In
the ﬁrst grand vaulted hall, below the
cornice which runs round the lower
part, various objects of Egyptian fur-
niture are represented. as metal mir-
rors. boxes and chairs of very ele-
gant shape, vases, fans, arms, neck-
laces, and numerous insignia. In
the succeeding passages the subjects
resemble many of those in the un-
ﬁnished hall of No. 17. The sculpo
tures are in in lie; but whenever
the name of the 'ing appears it is
merely painted on the stucco; and
those in the second vaulted hall are
partly in intaglio and partly in out-
line, but ofa good style. 'Ihe sarco-
phagus has been broken, and the lid,
on which is the ﬁgure of the king in
relief, has the form of a royal name
or oval.

This tomb was open in the time of
the Ptolernies. Its total length is
863 feet, without the ltyplthl'll en-
trance. but it is unﬁnished; and be»
hind the ﬁrst hall another large cham-
ber aith pillars was intended to have
been added.

No. 15. is of Osirei II. 'Ihe h-
gures at the entrance are in relief.
and of very good style. Beyond this
pauge it is unﬁnished. Part ofthe
broken sarcophagus lies on the other

side of the hall. It bears the name
of this monarch in intaglio; and lie
ﬁgure on the lid, a ﬁne specimen of
bold relief in granite, is raised nine
iaches above the surface. This esta-
oomb was open at an early epoch.
In total length is 236 feet.

No. lzis unsculptured. Itreachee
only toadistance of 179 feet, buthas
several side chambers at the upper
end. The last room crosses over
No. 9. It was probably known to
the Greeks and Romans.

No. 10., adjoining the Harper's
tomb, presents the name of Amun-
meses,whoseessctera,aswellas
that of the two queens who are intro-
duced in the inner part of this cata-
comb, is uncertain. It is, however,
probable that he lived in the 91st
dynasty. This was alsoopen at an
early period. It is now closedafter
the distance of about 950 feet.

No. 16. isof Remeses,or Remeaso
I., the father of Osirei, and
father of Reason 11.; being the
oldest tomb hitherto discovered in
this valley; and is amon the num-
ber of those opened by Be aoni. The
sarcophagus within it bears the same
name.

No. 18. is of Rcmcsee X., but is
almost entirely tilled up. It was
probably one of those open in the
time of the Ptolemies.

No. 5. is nearly closed. Its plan
differs very widely from those of the
other tombs. Neither of these are
deserving of a visit.

No. 19. is a small catacornb, which
presents the name of a prince Runes,
or Remeseo-Ma . . .,
features are very peculiar. He was
a royal scribe and commander of the
troops, and appears to have been heir-
apparent at the time of his death. it
is only open to the distance of about
65 feet.

No. 20. is a long passage, of which
only 170 feet have been explored, deb
scending to depth of 76 feet 3
pendicu ar. It was supposed to
