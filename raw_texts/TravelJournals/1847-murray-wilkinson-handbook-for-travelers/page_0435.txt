Arabs with their camels for the

journey had perhaps better be en-

at Keneh.

re is nothing worthy of remark
on the Moayléh road. There are
some Ahabdeh Arabs settled near this
and the Derb E’ Ruseafa. from whom
milk may sometimes be obtained;
and camels, laden with corn for Are-
bia, are occasionally met on their way
to gossayr.

The most interesting read is the
Derb E‘ Rusaefa; from the ancient
Roman stations met with at intervals,
and from its having been the old road
from Coptos to Philoteras Portus.
There are eight of these stations. or
H some of which are distant
from each other only 6, others from
Bto 19 miles; besides the wells of
El Eghay’rta, which were also known
to the ancients. The ﬁrst station,
whose site and plan is less easily
traced than the others, was distant
from COptos only 9 miles, and was
probably common to the Philotera
and Berenice roads, though not given
in the lists at Pliny or the Itinerary
of Antoninus.

Breech: Quentin—Near the large
wallof Hammam‘t, on this road, are
the quarries of Breecia Verde, from
which so many sarcophagi. fonts,
(use. and other ornamental objects
made of this beautiful stone, were
cut by the ancients, both in Pharhonic
and Roman times. The valley of
the quarries is called Wadée Peak-
heér. from the quantity of pottery
(Fo‘htir) found there. It is also re-
markable for the number of hiero-
glyphic inscriptions on the rocks, of
very early time. for the number of
huts of worltrnen who lived there.
and for the remains ofa small Egyp-
tian temple of the time of Ptolemy
Energetes l. The inscriptions on
the rocks are interesting from their
antiquity, some being of very ancient
Pharaohs.
