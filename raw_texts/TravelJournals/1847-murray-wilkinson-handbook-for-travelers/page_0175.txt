There are few streets in Cairo of
snthient breadth to admit carriages,
without great inconvenience to foot
passengers, if the changes now taking
place in the East introduce their use.
Here and there, however, streets are
met with broad enough to allow
them a free passage ; and the Pasha's
carriage goes from the citadel to the
gates without difﬁculty. Carts, indeed,
employed in carrying rubbish from
some of the fallen houses, are often
seen in the larger thoroughfares; and

though there are few where two.

esrrtages could pass each other, it
may be said that nearly all the prin-
cipal streets are sufﬁciently broad to
admit one. Here and there a gate-
way or e sharp turning would be a
serious obstacle; the unfortunate foot
passengers would be occasionally
crushed; and the projecting fronts of
shops would inevitably be carried
away; but these last incumbrances
have latcl y been partially removed, and
the most intrusive have withdrawn to
the line ofthe houses, upon which like
a fungus they had previously grown.

The by-streets, and those in the
quarters of the interior, are very nar—
row; and in consequence of the

muons — carts.

Cairene mode of building houses. each
story projecting beyond that imme-
diately below it, two persons may
shake hands acroasthe street from the
upper windows. This narrowness of
the streets is common to many towns
in hot climates, having for its ob-
ject greater coolness; and so small
a portion of blue at is sometimes
seen between the projecting sneaks-e-
bélu, or the approaching tops of the
houses, that they might give a very
suitable answer to the lines in Vir-
gil,_

Some of the headers are covered over
to protect those seated in the shopshe-
low from the sun; and where the
coverings are of wood, the appearance
of the street is not injured by the
eﬂ'ect; but when of mats or a mere
owning, their tattered condition, and
the quantity of dust they shower down,
during a strong wind, upon those be-
low, tend little to the beauty of the
street, or to the comfort of the people,
for whose beneﬁt they are intended.
The streets of the heaters are also
kept cool by watering ; which, though
it may contribute to that end, has a
very prejudicial effect; the vapour
constantly arising from the damp
ground in a climate like Egypt, tend-
ing greatly to cause or increase oph-
thalmia; and to this may, in a great
degree, be attributed the startling fact
that one out of sis among the tube-
bitants of Cairo is either blind, or has
some complaint in the eyes.
