stance of the internal decorations of
an Egyptian palace. Here the king
is attended by his liar-59m. some of
whom present him with ﬂowers. or
wave before him fans and ﬂabella;
and a favourite is caressed, or invited
to divert his leisure hours with a
game of draughts; but they ate all
obliged t'o stand in his presence, and
the king alone is seated on an elegant
fauteuil, amidst his female attendants,
—a custom still prevalent throughout
the East. The queen is not among
them; and her oval is always blank,
wherever it occurs, throughout the
building.

The same game of draughts is re-
presented in the grottoes of Beni
Hassan, which are of a much more
early period than the era of the third
Remeses, and date about 1700 a. c.
in the time of Osirtasen, the cotem-
porary of Joseph. That it is not
chess, is evident from the men being
all of similar size and form, varying
only in colour on opposite sides of
the board. I have sometimes seen
them with human heads; and some
have been found of a small size, with
other larger pieces, as if there was a
distinction, like our kings and com-
mon men in draughts.

On the front walls the conqueror
smites his snppliant captives in the
presence of Amunre, who. on the
north-east side, appears under the
form of Re, the physical Sun, with
the head of a hawk. An ornamental
border, representing “ the chiefs " of
the vanquished nations, extends along
the base of the whole front; and on
either side of the oblong court, or
passage of the centre, Remeses oﬁ'ers
similar prisoners to the deity of the
temple, who says—“ Go, my che-
rished and chosen, make war on
foreign nations, besiege their forts,
and carry oﬂ‘ their people to live as
captives."

Here ornamented balustrades, su p-
ported each by four ﬁgures of African
and Northern barbarians, remind us
of Gothic taste; and the summit of

the whole pavilion was crowned with
a row of shields, the hattlements of
Egyptian architecture. Hence a
dromoa of 965 feet led to the main
ediﬁce on the N.W., whose front is
formed of two lolty pyramidal towers,
or prupyla, with a pylon or doorway
between them, the entrance to the
ﬁrst area or propylcurn.

The sculptures over this door refer
to the panegyries of the king, whose
name, as at the palace of Remeses 11.,
appears. in the centre. Those on the
west tower represent the monarch
about to slay two prisoners in the
presence of Pthah-Soltari, others
being bound below and behind the
ﬁgure of the god. In the lower part
is a tablet, commencing with the
twelfth year of Remeses; and on the
east tower, the same conqueror smites
similar captives before Amunre. Be-‘
neath are other names of the con-
quered cities, or districts, of this
northern enemy; and at the upper
part of the propylon, a ﬁgure of
colossal proportion grasps a group of
suppliant captives his uplifted arm is
about to sacriﬁce. Amunre, under
the form of Re, holds forth the sword
of vengeance, and addresses the king
in a long speech (contained in nine-
teen lines), announcing that the Gen-
tiles, or foreigners of Libya, are beaten
down beneath his mighty feet; that
the god has come to give him the
chiefs of the Gentiles of the South,
to carry away them and their children,
. . . the goods of their country, . . .
and smite them with his swond, . . .
that he gives the North countries.

. . and to reduce the land of . . .
under his powerful sandals; . . . that
the god gives him the nations . . . to
bring to the land of Egypt . . . the
gold and silver to serve for the deco-
ration of the temple (he erected) . . .
that he gives him dominion over the
East . . . and the land of Pount, . . .
that he gives him dominion over the
West . . . and other countries, whose
names I have not been able to ascer-
tain. Such, however, is the form of
