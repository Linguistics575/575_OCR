condition of the stone, has the ap-
pearance of still greater age than
those of Beach. It stands on a
ridge of hills. that altirt the desert
behind Kth, and forms the
southern side of a large valley, a
branch of the Bahr e1 Fargh, which
I shall have occasion to mention pre-
sently. The pyramid itself has only
about 5 or 6 courses of stone re-
mainin . and contains nothing but
an nmfergrsund chamber, to which
a broad inclined passage, 160 feet
long, descends at an angle of 22°
35’, on the north side. These are
the measurements given by Colonel
Vyse, who calculates the base of the
pyramid to be 820 feet square, and
the chamber 40 by 15, with smaller
apartments over it, as in the great py-
ramid of Geeseh.

Near the pyramid to the westward
is another stone ruin; and a cause-
way 30 feet broad leads up to the
height on which they both stand,
from the northward; the length of
which is said by Colonel Howard
Vyse to be 4950 feet. A great quan-
tity of granite is scattered around
the pyramid, mostly broken into
small f ments, with which (if ever
ﬁnished) t was probably once cased.
From the hill is a ﬁne view over the
valley of the Nile; and being much
higher than that of the great pyra-
mids, it commands them, and has
the advantage of showing them in
an interesting position, with those of
Abooséer, Sakhdra, and Dashéor, in
the distance. This view is also re-
markable from its explaining the ex-
pression “ peninsula, on which the
pyramids stand," used to denote the
isolated position of the hill. It is the
same that Pliny applies to the isolated
rocky district about Syene.

At the eastern extremity of the
hills of Abooroﬂsh are some massive
crude brick walls, and the ruins of
an ancient village, with a few unin-
teresting tombs in the rock; and in
the sandy plain to the south of them
is the tomb of the shelth who has given

A little more than one-third of the
way from the pyramids of Geeseh to
Abooroiish, you pass, some way inland
tothe right, the ﬂea doaslm'dyucf
several arches built by the Arab sul-
tans. They have each two Arabic
inscriptions, mentioning the king by
whom they were built, and the date
of their erection. The westernmost
of the two has on one side the name
of Naser Mohammed, the son of
Ka-laéon, with the date 716 a. s.
(131748, a. 1).); and on the other
that of El Ashraf Abool Nugr Ka'éd-
hay e' Zaheree, with the date 884 am.
(a. n. I480). The eastern bridge
has the name of the latter hing on
both sides, and the same date of 884
a. a. when they were both completed
or repaired.

Half way from the pyramids to
Aboaroiish are the remains of an old
village on the edge of the desert, now
a heap of pottery and bricks.

ﬂ. BUSIRIS.

Close to the pyramids was an an-
cient village called Busiris, from which
the people used to ascend them, being
paid, no doubt, by visitors, as the
peasants are by travellers at the pre-
sent day to go over the casing to the
top of the second pyramid. The
steps said by Diodorus to have been
cut in the face of that pyramid, were
probably similar to those used by the
maple who ascend it in moderntimes,
being merely small holes sufﬁciently
deep and broad to place the feet and
hands. The same kind of rude steps
were probably cut in the faces of the
great pyramid also, before the casing
was removed, which, if we may be-
lieve Abd e’ Latif, did not happen till
a late time. .

The village of Busiris may have
stood on the site of one of those
below the pyramids: that called El
Hamra, “ the red, ” or, more com-
monly, E1 Kbm-el-Aswed, " the black
