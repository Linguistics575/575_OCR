than two thirds of the value of the

tom 2. Inthisasineverypartof
the country, it may be observed as a
general ru e,that you are never ex-
pected to supply, or pay for, the food
of the camels, or the provisions of the
Arabs under any plea whatever; any
oﬂ'er of the kind would infallibly lead
to imwdtions born the very persons
it was intended to befriend, and every
attempt on their part to make such a
demand should be ﬁrmly resisted.
This I urge the more strongly, as
some have been very improperly ad-
vised to provide beans for the camels,
on the plea of having them for their
return to El A’gaba, oron some other
excuse. 3. You should always en

the Sinai Arabs and their came s at
Cairo, end not be persuaded to go
by water from Sues to Tor, where,
having you in their power, they may
demand whatever they choose, with-
out leaving you any alternative but
that of returning to Sues end aban-
doning your intended journey.

Another observation 1 may also
make about the tricks upon travellers
practised by the Arabs, particularly
in 8 ria, which should not be tole-
re . it sometimes happens that a
traveller is stopped on the road, by
what is said to be a party of hostile
Arabs. end obliged to pay a sum of
money, as he supposes, to save his
life, or to secure the continuation of
his journey in safety.

Every body who knows Arab cus-
toms must be aware that no one of a
hostile tribe can ever enter the ter-
ritory of any other Arabs, without
the insult being avenged by the
sword; and it is evident if no resist-
ance is made on the part ofthoee who
conduct the traveller, that the attack-
ing party are either some of their
own, or of a friendly, tribe, who are
allowed to spoil him by the very per-
sons hcpa s toprotecthim; for an
Arab wou rather die than suﬂhr
such an affront from a Mile tribe in

not ﬁght on the occasion, he may be
sure it is a trick to extort money: he
should, therefore, usenoarms against
the supposed enemies, but afterwards
punish his faithless guides by deductn
ing the sum taken from their pay;
and it is as well, before starting, to
make them enter into an engagement
thatchey sreablsaswellaevilliag to
protect him.

I should add, that on starting it is
very necessary to see that ev camel
has its proper and full load; if not,
the Arabs will put a few things on
each, and go away pretending they
are loaded, their object being to get
as many engaged as poan'ble.

The ehckhs of the Tor Arabs, who
generally accompany Europeans to

ount Sinai,are Twayleb, Romain.
and Baharah, of the Welad Sieed.
There is no objection to them, except
perhaps their having been spoilt by
Europeans, and taught to be exor-
bitant; but they have no very great
inﬂuence in their tribe, and are not
the principal shekhs. Care should
therefore be taken to ascertain if they
have sumcient authority to prevent
any disputes in the desert; and par-
ticularly if any quarrel has lately hap-
pened with the Mesayneh tribe, who
possess the district between Mount
Sinaiand El A’k_sba. lndeed,thesafest
mode would be to agree with a ahekh
of the latter for safe conduct through
that portion of the desert, if desirous
ofgoing to El A’yba, and in crossing
from that place to llebron, the He-
wat, or Heywdt A’rabs are the in-
ﬂuential tribe. The Tor Arabs, or
tribes of the peninsula of Mount Sinai,
are, according to Burclthardt, —

who live to the west of Mount
Sinai, and are subdivided into the
