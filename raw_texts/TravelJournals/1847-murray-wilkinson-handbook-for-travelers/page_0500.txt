J. P. S H E A’S

ENGLISH HOUSE-AGENCY OFFICES,
14 AND 15, PIAZZA DE srAGNA.

 

THE only practical establishment of the kind ever known here,
where the comforts and requirements of a family are thoroughly
understood, and the interest of employers properly attended to.

The undeniable improvement which J. P. S. has in a short
time eﬂ'ected in the system of House Letting, and the satisfaction
”pressed by those who have patronised him, will, he hopes,
recommend him to Visitors requiring large or smell Furnished
Apartments.

Experience enables J. P. S. to hold himself responsible for the
correct execution of any commission sent by letter, wherein
requirements are prOper'l y speciﬁed.
