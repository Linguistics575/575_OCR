Bohr e1 Far-git, or, as it is sometimes
called. Bohr-below, runs tost the
Widee e' Soom‘r (or El Maghra), on
the road to Sée'wsh on one side, and
to the back of the mountains on the
west of the Birket el Korn in the
Fyéom on the other; another branch
divergin towards the east, and com-
munica n with the valley of the
Nile a li e below Abooro°a'sh, about
ﬁve or six miles north of the pyramids
of Geexeh. The hills that border it
are of irregular form, its bed is varied
by numerous elevated ridges, and
depriving it of all the character of
a river, which many suppose it
originally to have been. Some have
even claimed it for the Nile, as an old
bed of that river, seeing in the petriﬁed
wood within its bed and on the adja-
cent hills the remains of boats that
navigated this ancient channel. But
instances of similar hollow valleys are
not wanting in the Oases and other
parts of the limestone regions, both
in the western and eastern deserts.

From El Ehah the salt water is
taken to Alexandria, and used as

The most usual and perhaps the
best route to the Oasis of Ammon is
from Cairo by Teraneh (as above);

Sect-II.

Baratoon; another from Tertneh by
Baratoon; and a third from the
Fyoom by the Little Oasis.

a. The road from Alexandria goes
by the seapcoast as far as Baratoon,
the ancient Par-tonium, and then
turns south to the 86ewah. It was
the road taken by Alexander. Browne
went by it in 1792, and reached
Séewah in 15 days. At Baratoon
are some ruins of Parctonium, which
Strebo describes as a city, with a
large port, measuring 40 stadia acrom.
By some it was called Ammonia.

b. That from TerAneh goes to
Hammim, and thence b Baratoon
to the Séewah; but itis a ong round,
and there is no good water except at
Hammim.

c. For the road than the Fyéom
to the Little Oasis, see Route 18.

From that Oasis to the Séewah,
they reckon 7 days, making only a
total of 10 days from the Fyoom ;but
the journey from the Nile may be cal-
culated at II} or 12 days, which is the
distance given by Pliny from Mem-
phis. In going from El Kasr, or from
Bowitti in the Little Oasis, they
reckon 4 days to Suttra, a small
irrigated spot with salt water, but
without any palms; then one day
and a half to Ar’rag, where are palms
and springs of good water; to the
north of which, and separated from it
by a hill, is Bahrayn, a valley with
palms and water. This is out of the
road. From Ar’rag to Mcrtesek is
one day. It has a few palms, and
water under the sand. Thence to
Séeweh is one day.

The Arabic name of the “ Oasis
of Amman," Siwah, or See-toot, is
doubtless taken from the ancient
Egyptian. It consists of two parts,
the eastern and western district; the
former the most fertile, and abound-
ing in date trees. According to
Browne, it is 6 miles in length, and
from 4} to 5 in breadth ; but from the
irregular form of all these valleys it
is diﬂicult to ﬁx the exact size of any
one of them; and this measurement
