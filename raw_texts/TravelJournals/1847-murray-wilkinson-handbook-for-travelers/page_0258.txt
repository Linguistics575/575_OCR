Arabs; but taking advantage of the
position of the traveller in these
lonely regions, who must pay what-
ever they choose to ask, or give up his
journey, their demands have become
so exorbitant, that few will feel dis-
posed to take this route; and it is far
better to go from Hebron.

There are two roads from He-
bron to Petra (Wadee Moose); the
eastern one by the south end of the
Dead Sea, occupies 44 h. 50:11.;
the western road. 42h. 10m. From
El Algaba to Hebron, or El Khaleel,
is 71b. 45 m.; El Akaba to Jeru-
salem, 80h.; but the best road to
Syria is from Cairo, or from Sues, on
returning from Mount Sinai.

The road passes a short way to the
south of Heliopolis, and of the Bir-
ket el Hag, over the plain where
Toman Bey was defeated by Sultan
Selim. After leaving the Menace
road you turn round the eastern cor-
ner of the large sand hills of Und-
tham. Um-Gummal is high land,
and from the summit the pyramids
are seen to the west, and Gebel
Attaga. near Sues, to the east. About
5 miles further you cross the Wadee
Jaﬂ'ra, which runs down to Belbays,
about 9 miles to the left. In the

ancient canal of Arsino’é you pa-
near the mounds of an old town,
called Tel e’ Rigabeh. Aboutemiles
to the east of it is another old town
called Abookesh‘yd, or e’ Sigheea
(see Route 7), on the and also. There
are the mounds of another town on
the south bank before you descend
into the canal, about three quarters of
a mile from Tel e’ Rigabeh, and 8
miles after leaving the canal are the
hills called El Beeud, “ the white.”

Salahé'e'h was probably either '1' -
sarta, or Sile, of the Itinerary of An-
toninus. One of the roads is more
direct than this, and leaves Salahéiil't
considerably to the left. Several
mounds of ancient towns are seen in
the distance; and Tel Defenneh,
which is neatly in a direct line be-
tween Salahé'éh and Pelusium,matks
the site of Daphne, the Tehaphnehes
or Tahpanhes of the Bible, which was
a fortiﬁed outpost of Pelusium, and
distant from it 16 Roman miles. At
Tahpanhes the Egyptian king is said
by Jeremiah to have had a palace. .
(Jeremiah liii. 9.)

Pelusium lies considerably to the
left of the road. The remains there
consist of mounds, and a few broken
columns. It is difﬁcult of access,
and is only approachable during the
high Nile, or when the summer’s
sun has dried the mud that is left
there by the inundation. It stands
near the sea-shore. It is now called
Iecneh (Tineh), which seems to
indicate the muddy nature of the soil
in the vicinity, for which some sup-
pose it was indebted to its ancient
appellation Pelusium, peIos being the
Greek for “ mud." lts ancient name
probably resembled the Peremoun or
Pheromi of the Copts, and the latter
is the origin of the Farama of the
Arabs. by which it is still known;
though Savary states that “ Farama
was founded to the E. of Pelusium,
which was a win in the 13m cen-
tury."

Pelusium in former times was a
place of great consequence. It was
