of no great height; they are all bmlt
with their sida inclinin inwards to-
wards the top,as isusu in E tian
buildings; and we may conclu e that
while the smaller tombs belonged to
private families or individuals, the
large once served as public burial-
niaces for the less wealthy classes.
Two to the 8. E. of the south-east
angle of the pyramid have a few
hieroglyphics. In the westernmost
one is the name of a very old king
over a false door above a pit,

and in the other a funeral inscription
over a similar false door; on the wall
opposite which are some herons and
animals of the country.

In the eastern face of the rocky
hei It on which the tombs and pyra-
mi s stand, are other tombs containing
sculpture, and the names of Shofo
(Sophie), and other ancient kings.
One of them,nearly in a line with the
8. E. angle of the great pyramid,
contains a curious and satisfactory
specimen of the Egyptian numbers,
from units to thousands, preﬁxed to
goats, cattle, and asses, which are
brought before the scribes, to be re-
gistered as part of the possessions of
the deceased.

This inventory of stock alludes to
the weekly, monthly, or yearly census
made for theowner of the estate, dur-
ing his lifetime, and not, as might be
supposed from being in a tomb, after
his death, he himself being present to
receive the report. The subjects m
latin to the manners and customs of
the gyptians, so common in their
tombs, are intended to show their
ordinary occupations. and are a sort

conﬁned exclusively to the occupant
of the tomb.

On the wall opposite the entrem
are three false doorwa of a style
rarely met with, except in the vicinity
of the pyramids, not very unlike those
at the end of the Egyptian gallery
in the British Museum, which came
from a tomb near the spbina. In the
door before each is a pit, where the
bodies were buried; and I have gene-
rally observed, that a pit me be
looked for beneath these false oors,
as before the stein in the walls of
tombs, at Beni Hassan and other
places.

Some sculpture and bierogl hics
may also be found in tombs un er the
brow of the rock, near the northern
causeway; some of which have are“
roofs of stone. But the most curious
orclted tomb is that to the N. of the
supposed temple on the B. side of the
second pyramid, which I have already
noticed. It has columns before it, and
is of the time of Psamaticus, in the
7th century a. c.

The southern muse“, I have ai-
read mentioned, in speaking of the
thi pyramid, to which it seems to
have been intended to convey the
stones up the hill ﬁom the plain,after
having been brought from the river.
I stated it was broken; but at the
base of the rocky height, to the south
of thewell and palm trees, thecon-
tinuation of it appears, with an open-
ing in the centre, forthepaasageof

travelling by the edge of
the desert during the high Nile. 'Ihe
stones were, no doubt, carried on

ram ds. t ofthe greet pyramigis
described by Herodotus as 5 stadee
long, IO orgyes (fathoms) broad,and
8 high, of polished stones adorned
with the ﬁgures of animals (hiero-
glyphics), and it took no lea than l0
years to complete it. Though the
