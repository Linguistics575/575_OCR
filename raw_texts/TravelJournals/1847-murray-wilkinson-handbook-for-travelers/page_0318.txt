of Leo Africanus, when it supplied
the whole of Egypt with ties, and ea-
ported great quantities to Tunis and
other parts of Barbary. A market is
held at Benisooef every week, but it
is badly supplied ; and the town can-
not boast even the common Eastern
comfort of a bath, which at Minieh,
and other large towns of Egypt, is

ordinary scenes common to all the

etrllting of which are, numerous boats
tied to the shore,- buil'aloes standing
or lying in the water,— women at
their usual morning and evening oc-
cupation of ﬁlling water-jars and
washing clothes, —- dogs lying in holes

newly arrived European stranger with
the odious word “ baitshish." This
is followed by the equally odious
“ Ya Hewigee," by which the Franks
are rather contemptuously designated;
and the absurd notion of superiority
over the Christians affected by the
Moslems is strikingly displayed in
these as in many other instances.

The village of Dayr Byad, in an
island opposite Benisooél', so called
from a neighbouring convent, is in-
