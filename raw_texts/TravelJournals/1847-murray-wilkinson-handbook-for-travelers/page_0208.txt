near the palace, is another kiosk,
called e’ Gabel, “ the hill," to which
you ascend by ﬂights of steps on two
sides, and which orms a pretty sum-
mer-house, risingas it does above a
series of terraces planted with ﬂow-
ers, and commanding a view over
the whole garden, the Nile, and the
hills in the distance. It consists of
one room paved with Oriental ala-
baster, having a fountain in the
centre.

The palace itself has nothing to
recommend it, but the view hem the
windows. The aviary is neat, sur-
rounded by Ionic columns of wood ;
bttt it is not overstocked with birds,
and in the cages outside one is sur-
prised to see a retirees and a nisr, the
two vultures of E y t, which are too
common to merit tﬁe r imprisonment.
Near this are some weeping willows,
whose bright green is very agreeable
in this hot climate, where they thrive
remarkably well.

Outside the gardens are the stables
of the Pasha, seldom containing any
horses worth looking at; and the cu-
riosity of strangers is expected not to
wish for more than an elephant, a
glrail‘e, and some gaselles kept in the
adjoining yard.

the pyramidsare a stockofprovisiolla,

some genitalia or water-binds, a sup-
ply of candles, a lanthorn, mats, and

carpet; and, if the traveller intends
passing the night there, a mattress and
bedding, and a broom for sweeping
out the tomb, where he is to take up.
his abode. A ﬂy-iiap is also neces-

sary, and, in hot weather, a mosquito

curtain. If he wishes to visit the

rooms discovered by Colonel Howard

Vyse over the king‘s chamber, he

must take arope-ladder, or a wooden

ladder in short pieces, to enable it to

be carried into the upper passage.

Chairs and tables are provided by
the shekh who lives there, whom he
will ﬁnd civil and obliging. Most
strangers complain of the torment of
the people of the village, who collect
about him like a swarm of ﬂies, forcing
their troublesome services upon him
to his great discomfort and incon-
venience. In order to avoid this, on
arriving at the ﬂight of steps leading
to the enclosure before the tombs, he
had better call for the shekh, and re-
quest him to appoint 3 or 4 guides,
who will act as guards at night, and
attend him during his stay, to the en-
tire exclusion of every other person.
On leaving the pyramids, he may pay
them at the rate of 5 piastres a day,
if for 3 or 4 days, or rather more if
for l day, or when they have had much
trouble in assisting him into the up-
per chambers of the pyramid ; the
shekh himself receiving about the
same for the use of his tables and
chairs. Nothing, on any account,
should be given them when in the py-
ramids, and all attempts at esaction
should be ﬁrmly resisted.

The time occupied in going to the
pyramids depends on the season of the
year. When the lands are free from
water, the road is direct from Geeseh,
a distance of about 5 miles; but,
during the inundation, it follows the
gisr, or dyke, and is a great détovr,
being double that distance. It then
passes by the village of Shebrnmént,
which is half-way between the pyra-
