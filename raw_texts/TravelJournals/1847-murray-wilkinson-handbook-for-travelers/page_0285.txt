some are covered with arches, over
which part of the dwelling-rooms ere
built.

Married people alone are allowed to
inhbit the upper town, and there no

are admitted. Nor is a
native bachelor tolerated there: he is
obliged tolive in the lower town, and
Is thought unworthy to reside in the
nose quarter as his married friends
until he has taken a wife.

He then returns to the family
house, and builds a suite of rooms
above his father’s; over his again, the
second married son establishes him-
self, and the stories increase in pro
portion to the size of the family. This
suches to account for the height of
many of the houses at ‘Séewah. A
similar regulation seems to have been
observed in ancient times; and Q.
Curtius says the ﬁrst circuit contains
the old palace of the kings (shelths);
in the next are their wives and chil-
dren. as well as the oracle of the god ;
and the last is the abode of the guards
and soldiery.

The Séewah was first brought
under the rule of Mohammed Ali,
and attached to Egypt, in 1820. It
was then invaded and taken by Has-
san Bey Shamashirgee, who has thI'
since received the revenues, as well
as those of the Little Oasis and
Farifreh, which he also annexed to
Egypt. 15' Dakhleh belongs to Ibra-
him Pasha. and the Great Oasis pays
its taxes to the overmnent treasury.

of revenue, as already stated. is de-
rived from dates. The people have
few manufactures beyond those things
required for their own use; but their
skill in making wicker baskets ought
not to pass unnoticed, in which they
far excel the people of the Other
Oates.

As I did not visit the Séewah
I am indebted to other travellers
for the foregoing short notice of it,
and to some Seewee people I met
at the little Oasis for the peculiar
customs l have mentioned; to which
I will only add this advice to travel-
lers who go to the Séewah, that
they provide themselves beforehand
with letters and good guides.

a. Roads to the Fyoém. 6. Dis-
tances from Cairo to Medeeneh,

a. Many roads lead from the val-
ley of the Nile to the Fiodm, which
is only separated from it by the low
range of the Libyan hills. Some go
from the neighbourhood of the pyra-
mids, and others from El Kafr. (our
Dashoor), from Kafr-el-lyit (Aiat),
from Ogsyt, from Benisooef. and from
nearly every place between Kerdsssy
and Bchnesa. The best roads are
from Cairo by I'll Kafr, and from
Benisooef; and as the mostconvenient
way of visiting the I-‘y‘oom is to gofrom
Cairo, and send up your boat to Beni-
tooef and join it there, I shall give
the route by El Kafr to Medeeneh,
and from Medeeneh to Benisooef.
Those who merely wish to make a
rapid excursion to the Fy‘oom may go
from Benisooef, and back again.
