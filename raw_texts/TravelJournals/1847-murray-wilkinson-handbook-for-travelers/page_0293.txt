Herogzue: says, the lower under-
ground chambers were set apart " for

the sepulchres of the sacred crocodiles,
and of the kings who founded the
monument.” The crocodile was the
sacred animal of the nome, and gore
its name to the city of Crocodilopolis;
and it was the hatred of the inhabit-
ants of the neighbouring province of
Heracleopolis for this animal that
caused the destruction of the laby-
rinth. De Pauw makes a judicious
remark respecting its worship, which
will apply to that of the eel at Phra-
groriopolis, and of other ﬁsh in differ-
ent parts of Egypt; that the towns
where it was sacred always stood at
some distance from the Nile. in or-
der to ensure the maintenance of the
canals which conducted the fresh
water to those places, without which
the crocodile could not live.

Near lllahoon is another crude
brick pyramid; and a short distance
to the S. W. of that town, at the vil-
lage of Hawara. are the great stone
dyke and sluices. mentioned by Abool-
feda, that regulate the quantity of
water admitted into the Ffoém. Some
remains of older bridges and dykes
swept away by various irruptions of
the Nile are seen there, and to the
west is a dylte, serving as a cnmmu—
nication with the high land at the edge
ofthc desert during the inundation.

From the branch of the Bahr Yeo-
sel', which runs from the bridge of
lllahoon to Medeéneh, numerous
canals conduct the water to serious
parts of the province, the quantity
being regulated by sluices. according
to the wants of each. One goes lront
the bridge of lllahoon along the edge
of the southern hills to El (Sheet-h and
Nealeh; another by the labyrinth to-
wards Tomé'e'h; ten others between
ﬂowers and Mcdeéueh; and the

same number from the west side of
Medeéneh to the central villages of
the Ffoém. As of old, they still
offers more interesting specimen of
irrigation than any other part of
Egypt; and were it properly ma-
naged, there is little doubt that this
province would enjoy its former repu-
tation for fertility, notwithstanding
the injury done to many parts by the
increase of nitre in the soil.

About 2 miles to the south-west of
the bridge of lllahoon are the mounds
of an ancient town, called Toma,
which, from its name and position.
probably marks the site of Ptolema'is,
the port of Arsino'e. It may be
seen on the way to Benisooel'.

There are two main branches from
the Bahr Yooset' that conduct the
water into the Pyoom, and during the
inundation sereral smaller canals that
oblige you to malte a long detour in
going from lllahoon; the distance
from which, in a line, is only about [4
miles. To the right you see the lofty
mounds of Anasieh, the ancient Hera-
clropolis, which stood in an island
formed by the canal. The mounds
of Noayteh, Bsheh, Beshennee, Bi-
liﬂieh, Kom Ahmar, and others also
mark the sites of old towns.
