Wadee Ghomyer (or el Gbomeir)
opens upon the Nile at E‘Snf on the
east bank. By this valley runs the
southernmost of the roads across the
desert to Sues.

W.S.W. from Rigga; on the op-
posite bank, is a pyramid, called by
the Arabs “ Hdm d Mb,” or the
“ false pyramid,” from the erroneous
idea that the base is merely roclt, and
that it doesnotform part of the build-
ing itself. It is built in stories or
degrees, and is remarkable for the
position of the stones, which lie nearly
at tire of the exterior angle,
and not horizontally, as in other
monuments.

At Atfé'e'hare themoundsof Aphro-
ditOpolis, or the city of Athor, the
Egyptian Venus. it pnesents no
monuments. The Coptic name is
Tpéh, or Petpieh, easily converted
into the modern Arabic Atfé'éh. It
was the capital of the Aphroditopo-
lite name, and noted, as Strabo tells
us, for the worship of a white cow,
the emblem of the goddess.

At Maydoon, which stands on the
canal, Opposite the false pyramid. are
lofty mounds of an ancient town;
and opposite Zow'ych, at the north
corner of the low hills overlookin
the Nile, is Broombel, where man
marks the site of an old town, pro-
bably Ancyronpolis. That city is
supposed to have owed its name to
the stone anchors said to have been
cut in the neighbouring quarries.

Zow’yeh appears to be iseuln, in
Coptic Neesi, the cit of Isis, which
stood near the canal ceding to Pou-
siri, or Nilopolis, and thence to the
Crocodilopolite name. This canal
on the north, with part of the pre-
decessor of the Bshr Yoosef on the
west, and the Nile on the east. formed

it was the capital. And this agrees
with the position of Anesieb, or Om
ei Keemen, “the mother of
mounds," as it is often called by
Arabs, from the loﬂy mounds of
old city, which are seen inland
twelve miles to the wutward of Be-
nisooef.

Nothing of interest is met with on
the Nile between Zow’yeh and Be-
nisooef.

south-west of the former is Abooaeer,

situated far from the river.

Zaytoon has succeeded to an ancient
town. called in Coptic Phennigéit.
it was in the district of Poushin, the
modern Boosh, which is distant about
three miles to the south, and is
marked by lofty mounds. It is re.

the old name Pha-ii-ni-ghit, “the
place of olives,” probebl given it to
show a quality of the and, which
differed from the rest ofthe Heracleo-
polite nome.

Dallas, about a mile to the 8. W.
of Zaytoon, appears to be the Tgol (or
Tlog) of the Copta; and at Shenowe'e'h.
close to Boosh. are mounds of an
ancient town, whose name is un-
known.
