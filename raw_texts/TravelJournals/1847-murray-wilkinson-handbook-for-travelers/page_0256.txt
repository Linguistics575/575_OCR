of Wadee Arraba are maintained by
the convent of St. Antony.

The Gebel Moose consists of two
parts; the lower portion has been
called Mount Horeb, and the name of
Mount Sinai has been applied to the
highest peak, which stands upon the
elevated platform of Hersh.

I do not venture, nor do I feel
myselfauthorised, to give an opinion
respecting the disputed c aims of
Gebel Moose and Mount Catherine to
the sites of Sinai and Horeb of Scrip-
ture. Nor'will I enter into the
question of Horeb being the name
used to denote “ the whole wilderness,
including the lower group, called
Gebel Serbal, as well as the upper
group of Mount Sinai," or of Sinai
being, as Mr. Kinnear supposes,
" the general names for the whole
cluster,” which is the Opinion of Dr.
Robinson. I may, however, observe,
that Horeb is sometimes mentioned
as “ an individual mountain," in the
same manner as Sinai, and is deno-
minated “ the mount Horeb." (Esod.
xxxviii. 6. 3 Dent. i. 6.)

The stone which is supposed by the
monks to have been the one struck by
Moses, and from which the water
gushed out in chhidim, is a piece of
the granite rock which has fallen from
the mountain above, and lies in a
hollow recess at the place where it
was stopped in its fall. It is remark-
able for an unusual appearance in the
centre of one side, which the credulous
have converted into the marks of
falling water.

On the top of Sinai is shown a
ﬁssure in the rock, where Moses is
supposed to have retired when the
glory of the Lord passed by 5 which,
ike all other localities, has been long
looked upon with undoubting faith
by the monks, and has been often
questioned by sceptics. I do not
pretend to enter upon these and other
controverted points ; but I cannot help
expressing a re which all must
feel, that though many have visited
this desert, we are still without an

\ From estothe'town of Tor the
rocks are limestone; the primitive
range extends thence neatly to Rae
Mohammed, the headland at its
southern extremity, at the point of
which the limestone again appears,
and runs to the eastward, or north-
east, along the coast to a little beyond
e’ Shurm, where the primitive rocks
again advance to the sea.- All the
mountain ranges about Gebel Moose
and the convent are primitive, and
stretch thence in a north-easterly di-
rection to Sarabut el Khidem, where
the secondary sandstones begin, in-
tervening between the primitive and
the limestone strata, and extending
thence on the west nearly to the town
of Tor, and on the east in the direc-
tion of El Alpha.

The town of Tor is not worth
visiting. It is a mere seaport, in-
ferior to Sues, and about 40 miles
from the convent.

It was probably founded originally
by the Phoenicians. and appears to
have been called Pltmnicon by the
Greeks, though its real name was per-
haps taken from the mother city
Tyre, Toor, or Tsur.
