spaces of the uppermost degrees.
This is preferable to my own interpre-
tation of the expression seam, which
I supposed to refer to the removal of
the projecting angles of the steps, to
form the slope of the pyramid.

Many of the stones, particularly in
the tombs, and the small pyramids,
are not in the same horizontal straight
line, and some of the joints arbitrarily
incline one way, some another, as in
many buildings of early Greek time;
a style which is looked upon as the
tranaitlon from Cyclopean and Pelas-
gic, to the perfect mode of building
in Greek architecture, where the
stones break joint, and the coursesare
all regular, as at the present day.
But the inclination of the stones in
those pyramids is irregular, and not
with any other object than to ﬁt the
stones to their accidental shape, and
may be attributed to the caprice of the
builders. Some have even fancied
that the courses of stones in the great
pyramid are slightly arched, or convex
upwards, like the stylohates of Greek
temples; but this is an error.

The outer layers. or casing, of the
third pyramid were of granite, many
of which still continue in their origi-
nal position at the lower part; nor
can we doubt the justness of Pliny’s
remark, when he says “ the third,
though much smaller than the other
two,” was “ much more elegant, ”
from the “ EthiOpian stone," or gra-
nite of Syene, with which it was
clothed. Herodotus and Strabo say,
this casing, which the latter calls
“black stone,” only extended half
way up; and Diodorus says to the
15th tier. It was let! unﬁnished in
consequence of the king’s death ; but
“the name of its founder was written
on its northern face. " Following
Herodotus, he calls him “ Myceri-
nus; or, as some say, Mecherinus.”
The stones of the casing have bevelled
edges; a style of masonry common
in Syria, Greece, and Rome; but
round the entrance their surfaces are
smooth, and of a lower level than the

Herodotus, after telling us it was
built by Mycerinus, the son of Cheops,
and not by Rhodopis, gives some
curious anecdotes of several
among whom are Esop and Sappbo;
but the conjecture mentioned by Dio-
dorus, that it was founded by Inaron,
is very far from the truth, if that king
was the same as Inarus; be having
lived (a. n. 463) as late as the reign
of Artaserxes Longimanus, 3 years
aﬂer Herodotus visited Egypt.

The measurements of the

Present base was 3330 feet by
measurement.

Present height perpendicular was
203 '7 feet by calculation with angle of
