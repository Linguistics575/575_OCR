when entire, nearly three times the
solid cont-13s of the great obelisk of
Karnak, weighed about 887 tone
5} hundred weight.

No building in Thebes corresponds
with the description given of the
tomb of Osymandyas by Hecatcus.
Diodorus, who quotes his work, gives
the dimensions of the ﬁrst or outer
court, two plethra, (181 feet 8 inches
English.) agreeing very nearly with
the breadth, but not the length of
that now before us; but the succeed-
ing court, of four plethra, neither
agrees with this. nor can agree with
that of any other Egyptian edifice,
since the plan of an Egyptian build-
ing invariably requires a diminution,
but no increase of dimensions, from
the entrance to the inner chambers;
and while the body of the temple,
behind the portico, retained one uni-
form breadth, the areas in front, and
frequently the portico itself, exceeded
the inner portion of it by their pro-
jecting sides. The peristyle and
“ columns in the form of living

beings,” roofed colonnade, sitting'

statues, and triple entrance to a
chamber supported by colurn ns, agree
well with the approach to the great
hall of this temple: and the largest
statue in Egypt can only he in the
building before us. Yet the sculp-
tures to which he alludes remind us
rather of those of Medeénet Haboo;
and it is possible that either Hecatcus
or Diodorus may have united or con-
founded the details of the two ediﬁces.
I have therefore introduced the ac-
companying plan of the Metnnonium.

The second area is about HO feet
by 170, having on the south and north
sides a row of Osiride pillars, con-
nected with each other by two lateral
corridors of circular columns. Three
ﬂights of steps lead to the northern
corridor (which may be called the
portico), behind the Osiride pillars,
the centre one having on each side a
black granite statue of ltetneses ll.,
the base of whose throne is cut to ﬁt
the talus of the ascent.
