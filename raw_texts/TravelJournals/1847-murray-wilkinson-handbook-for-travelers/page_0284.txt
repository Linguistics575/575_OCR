nothing, which is conﬁrmed by M. w

The productions of the Séewah are
very similar to tho.e of the Little
Oasis, but the dates are of very su-
perior quality, and highly esteemed.
They are of six kinds: 1. The Sol-
tinee; 2. The Sa'idee; 8. The Fri.-
hee; 4. The Kaibee; 5. The Gha-
salee; 6. The Roghm—Gbasalee.
The Frahee are the most esteemed.
They are s small white date, when
dry, and in 1824 they sold at from 5
to 8 dollars a camel load of 80 ad,
or rash (8* ardeb), in the Séewah, and
in Alexandria at from l5 to 20.

The people of Séewah are hos-
pitable, but suspicious and savage in
their habits and feelings. Strict in
the outward forms of religion, even
beyond those of the Little Oasis, they
are intolerant and bigoted in the ex-
treme; and like all peeple who make
a great outward display of religion,
are more particular about the observ-
ance of a mere form, or the exact
hour of prayer, than the life of a
human being.

They have a form of government
as well as a language peculiar to
themselves, which is in the hands of
several shelths, some of whom hold
the oﬂice for life, and others for 10
years. They are called elders or
senators, and are always consulted by
the shekhs of the villages on all matters
of importance. They dispensejustice,
and maintain order, in the province;
and the armed population is bound
to obey their commands for the de-
fence of the town and villages against
the Arabs or other enemies.

The Bayt-cl-mal, " house of pro-
perty," is a depét of all property of
persons dying without heirs, of ﬁnes
levied for various offences against the
state, as not going to prayers at the
stated times, and other crimes and
misdemeanors. The sums thus col.
lected are employed in charitable pur-
poses, repairing moslts, entertaining

strangers, or in whatever manner the
Diwan may think proper.

They have a curious custom in re-
ceiving strangers: as soon asany one
arrives, the shelth el Khabbar, “ sheila
of the news," presents himself, and
aﬂer the usual tokens of welcome,
proceeds to question him respecting
any sort of intelligence he may be able
to give. As soon as it has been ob-
tained from him, the shekh relates it
all to the people; and so tenacious
is he of his privilege, that even if
they had all heard it at the time from
the mouth of the stranger, they are
obliged to listen to it again from this
authorised reporter.

They understand Arabic; but have
a peculiar language of their own, of
which a native gave me the follow-
ing words: —

Tegmirt, a horse.
Dalghrﬁmt, camel.
Zeetun, donkey.
Shéha, goat.
Ragéwen, dates.
Esdin, wheat.
Tineeﬁ’tyn, lentils.
Roos (Arabic), rice.

Though the shelths pretend to great
authority over the people, they are
unable to prevent numerous feuds
and quarrels that take place between
different villages, and even between
two gear (families) in the same town.
These generally lead to an appeal to
arms, and ﬁerce encounters ensue,
oﬂen causing the death of many per.
sons on both sides, until stopped
by the interference of the fekgeés
(priests). Each party then buries its
dead, and open “war is deferred till
further notice.

The town of Séewah is divided into

-an upper and lower district. It is

defended by a citadel, built on a rock,
and surrounded by strong walls,—a
perfect protection against the Arabs,
and formidable even to better armed
assailants. The streets are irregular
and narrow, and, from the height of
the houses, unusually dark; and
