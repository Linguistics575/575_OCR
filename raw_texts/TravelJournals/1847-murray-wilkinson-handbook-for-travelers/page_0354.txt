called Medeenet Atreeb, and the
ruins in its vicinity may be the re-
mains of an old town; but the real
Atreeb or Athrihis stood about half
an hour's ride to the southward,
where a ruined temple and extensive
mounds still mark its site. I had
perceived them on goingtothe White
Mon ; and it was with great
satisfaction I found, on examination,
that they presented the unquestion.

Mia or Crocodilopolt's.

In the midst oftnounds of pottery
lie blocks of limestone, M to
15 feet longby s. and 5 feetthick, the
remains ofa temple 200 feet by 175,
facing the south, and dedicated to
the lion—headed Thripbis.
One block alone, the lintel of a door-
way, remains in its original place:
the rest are all thrown down, and I
could only discover the traces of one
column. Over this door is a king
oﬂ'ering to Leontocephale, Kbem,
and other deities, over whom is the
name of Ptolemy the Elder, son of
Anletes; and it is probable that the
foundation of the building is even of
a still earlier date.
the name of“ Kaisaros"(Casar), pro-
bably Augustus; and on a stone, at
the southern extremity of the ruins,
which covered the centre doorway or
entrance of the portico, are names
arranged on either side of a head of
Athor, surmounted by a globe con-
taining the mysterious eye, with two
up: wearing the crowns of Upper
and Lower Egypt, the whole group
being mmpleted by two sitting
deities. 'Such are the ornamental
devices of cornices and architraves on
temples of the time of the empire, as at
Dendera and other places. On the
soﬁt of the same were the ovals of
Tiberius Claudius Kaiaaros (Caesar)
Germanicns (2’) ; and on the other
side a Greek inscription accompanied
by the ovals of Claudius Caesar Ger-
manicns. The lower end of the block

Athribis, are the quarries from which
the stone of the temple was taken;
and below are several small grottoea
that have served for tombs, and were
once furnished with doors, secured,
as usual, by a bolt or look. On the
lintel of one of them is a Greek in-
