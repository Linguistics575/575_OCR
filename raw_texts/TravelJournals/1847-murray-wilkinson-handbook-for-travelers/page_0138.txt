palace and the arsenal, from the Frank
quarter, the road lies through the
principal streets of Alexandria; but a
walk should be taken in the bazaars,
in order to obtain a better idea of the
Turkish part of the town, though the
tortuous narrow streets, or rather un-
paved lanes, will not give an exalted
notion of this dirty quarter. The
stranger may, however, ﬁnd amuse-
ment in the novelty and dtollery of
many a scene witnessed there ; amidst
the confusion of camels carrying large
burdens through these narrow pas-
sages, the hurry of donkeys driven at
fu l trot or gallop, amidst a crowd of
pedestrians, and the more serious in-
convenience of a carriage. This last
can only pass through the principal
thoroughfare; and many an impre-
eation is whispered against so trouble-
some an intruder, which, before the
Pasha introduced his own, was un-
seen in Alexandria.

On leaving the Rosetta gate of
Alexandria, the toad runs for half a
mile over the mounds of the ancient
city, when it crosses the old wall, on
which the French lines were raised,
and descends into a plain. now partly
cultivated by order of Ibrahim Pasha.

old wall, two granite statues were dis-
covered by Mr. Harris, apparently of
one of the Ptolemies, or of a Roman
emperor, with his queen, in the Egyp-
tian style. One has the form of
Osiris, the other of Isis, or of Athor.
Other granite blocks and remains of
columns show that this was the site
of some important building.

About 2 miles beyond the French
lines, or 2; from the Rosetta Gate, is
a Roman station, called Caesar’s, or
the Roman, camp. It marks the site
of Nicopoh's, or J uliopolis, where Au-
gustus overcame the partisans of An-
tuny; and is the spot where, 1839
years after, the English and French
armies engaged. '

A few small monuments to same of
our countrymen who fell there may
still be seen outside the walls, on one
of which I observed the name of
Colonel Dutens. It had been thrown
down, and we once more put it up,
with a faint hope of its being left in
that position. Here fell the gallant
Abercromhie, on the memorable 21st
of March, lSOl.

The “ Camp ” resembles the Myos
I-Iormos, and the fortiﬁed stations or
lag/dreams in the deset t; but is strong-
er, larger, and better built. It is
nearly square, measuring 291 paces
by 266 within, the walls being from
5 to 5] paces thick. It has four en-
trances, one in the centre of each
face, 15 paces wide, defended by round
or semicircular towers, 18 paces in
diameter, or 12 within. On each face
are 6 towers, distant from each other
33 paces; those of the doorway ex-
cepted, which are only 15 paces apart.
Those at the 4 comers are larger than
the others, having a diameter of 99
paces. The whole was surrounded
by a ditch, apparently ﬁlled from the
sea, which is close to the N. W. face:
and a short way from the S. W. gate
are the remains of the aqueduct that
supplied it with water; probably part
of the one seen to the north of the
Mnhmoodéiih, about 8 miles from
Alexandria. The walls are of stone,
