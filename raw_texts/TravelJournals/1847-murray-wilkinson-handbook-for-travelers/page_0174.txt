The greater part of these tombs
stand outside the town, a short dis-
taneeto the Ed the Bab e‘ Nusr.
They are frequently called by Euro-
peans “ of the caliphs,” as above
stated, but are better known to the
Cairenesas El gaitbay (grease); a
name taken from that of the prin-
cipal building, which is of El Ashraf
Aboo-l-Nusr imam e’ Ziheree, the
19th Sultan of this dynasty, who died
and was buried there in 1496 a.n.
The minaret and dome of his moslt
are very elegant, and claim for it the
ﬁrst place among these splendid monu-
ments, though some others may be
said to fall little short of it in
beauty; and those of El Bérkool;
and El Eshraf have each their re-
spective merits. El Bérkook or E'-
Zaher Berhook was the ﬁrst sultan of
this dynasty, and was renowned for
having twice repulsed the Tartars
under Tamerlane in 1893-4.

To each of these tombs a moslt is
attached, as to the others already
mentioned in Cairo; and in the latter
place it may often be doubted whether
the tomb has been attached to the
mask, or the moslt to the tomb.

It is much to be regretted that these
interesting monumentsare suffered to
fall to decay: the stones have some-
times even been carried away to serve
for the construction of other build-
ings; and there is reason to fear that
in another fifty cars they will be a
heap of ruins. in their architecture
they resemble some of the moslts of
Cairo: and the same alternate black
and white, or white and red, courses
of stones occur, as in those within the
city, which call to mind the same
peculiarity in some of the churches of
Italy. The stone of which they are
principally built is the common stone

of the neighbouring hills. The black
limestone is brought from the vicinity
of the convent of St. Antony in the
eastern desert; but the red bands in
the masks of Cairo are merely painted
on the originally white surface.

There are other tombs called “of
the Memlooks,” to the south of the
city, usually designated by the Cai-
renes as the Imam e' Shatfaee, from
the chief of that branch of Moslems
whose tomb there forms a conspicuous
object. It is easily recognised by its
large dome, surmounted by a weather-
cock in the form of a boat. It is
said to have been built by Yoosef.
Salah-e’ deen (Seladin), from which
it received, according to Pococlte, the
name of e' Salahe'e'h. Near this is
the sepulchre of Mohammed Ali and
his family, consisting of a long corri-
dor and two chambers, each covered
by a dome, in the inner one of which
is the tomb intended for the Pasha
himself. The others are of Toossoom
and Ismail Pashas, his sons; of Mo-
hammed Bey Defterdar; of Zéhla
Pasha, his sister; of his ﬁrst wife;
of Mustafa Bey Delli Pasha, his
wife's brother; of Ali Bey Sslonilt-
lee, and his wife, a cousin of the
Pasha; of Toossoom Bey, Shereef
Pasha’s brother, and his wife; of
Hossayn Bey, the nephew; of the
younger children of the Pasha; and
of Ibrahim Pasha’s sister, Tal'éedeh
Hanem, the wife of Moharrem Bey.
Many of the tombs near to the city
on this side are also curious. and offer
interesting subjects for the pencil of an

Many of the Sibeéls or public foun-
tains in the city merit admiration, as
curious specimens of the peculiarities
of Oriental taste, abounding in great
lusuriance of ornament. The most
remarkable are of Toossoom and I email
Pashas, the sons of Mohammed Ali;
and some of older date in the centre
of the town.
