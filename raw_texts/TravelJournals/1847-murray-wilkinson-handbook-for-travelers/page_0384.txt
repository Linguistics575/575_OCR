from the stamp on the bricks them.
selves, was erected during the reign
uf'lhothmea III. The total ruin of
these buildings may be accounted for
from the smallness of their size, the
larger ones being merely defaced or
partially demolished, owing to the
great labour and time required for
their entire destruction.

Below the squared scarp of the
rock to the west of this, are other
traces of sandstone; and at the south,
lie taco broken statues of Ammwph 111.,
which once faced towards the palace
of Remeses II. They stood in the
usual attitude of Egyptian statues, one
leg placed forward, and the arms ﬁxed
to the side. Their total height was
about 35 feet. They either belonged
toan avenue leading to the temple at
Kom el Hettan, or to the ediﬁce at
a short distance beyond them, which
was erected by the same Amunoph,
as we learn from the sculptures on its
fallen walls. These consisted partly
of limestone and partly of sandstone;
and, to judge from the execution of
the sculptures and the elegance of the
statues once standing within its pre-
cincts, it was a building of no mean
pretensions. Two of its sitting colossi
represented AmunOph I l 1.; the others,
Pthahmen, the son and successor of
Remeses I I. These last were ap-
parently standing statues in pairs,

two formed of one block, the [mud of
one resting on the shoulder of the
other; but their mutilated condition
presents our ascertaining their exact
form, or the other
in these groups. But an idea may
be given of their cola-l siae by the
breadth acro- the shoulders, which is
ﬁve feet three inches; and though the
sitting statues of Amuuoph were
much smaller, their total height could
not have been less than ten feet.
About 700 feet to the south of
these ruins is the Ke- el Heads,“ the
“ mound of sandstone,” which marks
the site of another palace-temple of
Amunoph 111.; and, tojudge from ‘
the little that remains, it must have
held a conspicuous rank among the
ﬁnest monuments of Thebes. All
that now exists ofthe interior are the
bases of its columns, some broken
statues, and Syenite sphinxes of the
king, with several lion-headed ﬁgures
of black granite. About 200 'feet
from the north corner of these ruins
are granite statues of the asp-headed
goddess, and another deity, formed of
one block, in very high relief. In
front of the door are two large tablets
(stelm) of gritstone, with the usual
circular summits, in the form of
Egyptian shields, on which are sculp-
tured long inscriptions, and the ﬁgures
of the king and queen, to whom
Amunre and Soltari present the em-
blems of life. Beyond these, a long
dromos of 1100 feet extends to the
two sitting colossi, which, seated ma-
jestically above the plain, seem to
assert the grandeur of ancient Thebes.
Other colossi, of nearly similar
dimensions, once stood between these
and the tablets before mentioned;
and the fragments of two of them,
fallen prostrate in the dreams, are
now alone visible above the height-
ened level of the alluvial soil.
