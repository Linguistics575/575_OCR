dykes. Ithasheeuerroneously called
a lake.

The Inhabitants are principally of
the Howaynlt, or Owaynat tribe,
ones Arabs, and nwﬁwdimﬂlry
have possessed the for ass
70 years, and are now aided in tilling
it by another tribe, the Samaloos,
about thirty of whom reside in the
town, and the rest in tents in the
nei hbourhood.

it El Benian, “ the buildings,” to
the N. E. of El Ghércls, are an old
doorway, broken shafts, and capitals
of Cotlnthian columns of Roman
time, built into a shekh’s tomb; and
at Talcét and Shekh Aboo-Hamed,
to the eastward, are the mounds of
two other towns. These indeed
occur in many parts of the Pyoom;
and though we cannot credit the tra.
dition of the people that it formerly
contained 366 towns and villages, it
is evident that it was a populous
name of ancient Egypt; and that
many once existed both in the centre
and on the now barren skirts of the
Fyoom. Indeed the cultivated land
extended formerly far beyond its
present limits: it great portion of the
desert plain was then taken into cul-
tivation, and I have seen several
places where canals and the traces of
cultivated ﬁelds are still discernible
to a considerable distance E and W.
of the modern irrigated lands.

given way to the eastward. To
north of Hawara is a crude brick py-
ramid, which is highly interesting
from its marking the site of one (1
the most celebrated monuments of
ancient Egypt, the Labyrinth, at
whose northern extremity it stands.
When I visited it, the extent of that
buildingcould with diﬁculty be traced;
but it has since been excavated by Dr.
chsius. 80$cient,however,nemain—
ed above ground to show the extent
of the area it occupied, which mea-
sured 580 feet by 271 feet, within the
mounds raised round it, and whidl
separate it from the pyramid, distant
80 feet. The pyramid when entire
was 848 feet square; but it is much
ruined. The style of its building in
degrees, or stories, to which, sloping
triangular sides were afterwat ds added,
is very evident. The bricks are of
great size, and appear to be of very
great age. Strabo gives 4 plethra
(400 feet) for the length of each face,
and the same for the height, which
Herodotus calculates at 50 orgyies
(300 feet). From Colonel Howard
Vyses's account it appears to cover a
rock, which rises to the height of about
40 feet within it. Several stone walls
intersecting it in regular lines, act as
binders to the intermediate mass of
brickwork, built in between them;
and the outside was coated with a
stone casing.

Close to the west side runs asmall
modern canal; and on the opposite
bank, as well as on the east side, are
the fallen walls of crude brick houses,
mostly of late time.

I observed amidst the ruins of the
labyrinth some broken columns of
line red granite, in the old Egyptian
style, with the bud capitals, 4 feet 7
in., and 3 feet 5 in. in diameter, frag-
