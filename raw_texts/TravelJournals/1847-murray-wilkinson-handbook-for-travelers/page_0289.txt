union of these two branches that the
sluices for irrigating the Arsino'ite
name were ﬁxed; and the northern
was the only one opened during the
low Nile.

At all events, the account of the
water returning from the lake to the
Nile, on the retiring of the inunda-
tion, is totally inapplicable to the
Bit ket el Earn, the level of its sur-
face being about 190 feet lower than
the bank of the river at Benisooef;
which, making every allowance for
the rise of the bed of the Nile, and
the proportionate elevation of its
banks, could never have been on a
level, even in Herodotus’s time, with
that lake; and consequently no re-
turn of the water could have taken
place from it to the Nile. And that
the surface of the lake is about the
same now as formerly is evident,
from our ﬁnding ruins on its shores
at the water‘s edge; and its acciden-
tal and temporary rise, which hap-
pened some years ago, was merely
owing to the bursting of the great
dyke at Tomé'éh.

The Bthen of D'Anville is purely
imaginary.

The ruins of Kant Wrseént or Kora
Wesltefm—el-Ifnggar, are little more
than 5 miles from the eastern end of
the lake, and 4 from ToméEh, close
to the road leading to the pyramids.
They consist of extensive mounds,
and below them are remains of crude
brick houses on stone substructions.
amidst which may be traced the di-
rection of the streets of a town. On
the mounds the remains seem to be
chieﬂy, if not entirely, of tombs, in
some of which animals were buried.
I observed a few granite blocks, and
others of a compact shell limestone.
Some of the former had been cut
into millstoncs. I also found frag-
ments of glass, and Ptolema‘ic coins
badly preserved, which, together with
an arched room, prove these ruins to
be of late time. Beyond the town to
the north-east are numerous large
round blocks of stone, extending to a

great distance along the plain, which
has given the epithet El Beggar to the
place; but they arenot hewn stone.and
have not belonged to any monument.

At El Ramadan, by the water's
edge, at this end of the lake, are the
remains of “ both," and a few other
ruins of no great interest, broken am-
phorae, glass, and other fragments.
A little above was the town to which
they belonged.

There is another place called “the
baths." with still fewer remains of
burnt brick, on the south side of the
lake; and to the east of this, at the
projecting headland below Shekh Abd
el ljadee, are a few more vestiges of
brickwork. The tomb of the Shekh
also stands on the site of an old town,
on the way from Senhoor to the Lake.

Nearly opposite these southern
“baths" are the ruins of Dir-dyer
Nrrba, a large town, distant about 9
miles from the lake.

0n the way from the usual place
of landing, below Dim‘y, you pan
several large blocks resembling broken
columns, but which are natural, as at
Kom Weseém.

A raised paved dromos leading di-
rect though its centre, to an elevated
platform and sacred enclosure, forms
the main street, about 1290 feet in
length, once ornamented at the upper
end with the ﬁgures of (ions, from
which the place has received the name
of Dimiy (or Dimeh) e' Saba. This
remarkable street, which recalls the
paved approach to the temple of Bu-
bastis, the lions, and the temains of
stone buildin s, prove the town to

. have been of ar greater consequence

than Korn Was-em. The principal
edifice. which is partly ofstone, stands
at the upper end of the street, and
was doubtless a temple: it measures
about l09 feet by 67, and is divided
into several apartments, the whole
surrounded by an extensive circuit of
crude brick, 870 feet by 970. An
avenue of lions was before the eu-
tranca of this sacred enclosure (or ta-

ster-ea). 07 feet in length, connecting
