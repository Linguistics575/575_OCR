The manna is still found in the
desert, yet it is rarely met with. Dr.
Robinson says, “ it is not produced
every year, sometimes only after 5 or
6 years, and the quantity in general
has greatly diminished. It is found
in the form of shining drops, on the

' and branches (not upon the
leaves) of the Turfa, (Theta-i: Gul-
lien metfm of Ehrenberg.) from
which it exudes in consequence of the

ore of an insect of the Coccus
' Coccas manipam of the same
naturalist.” It is white, of the site
of a very small pea, and “ what falls
upon the sand is said not to be ga-
thered. it has the appearance of
gum, is of a sweetish taste, and melts
when exposed to the sun, or to a ﬁre."
In Arabic it is called urea, and is sold
by the dru gists of Cairo. This
name is simi ar to the old Hebrew,
men or min, by which it is mentioned
in the Bible, and which was given it
in consequence of the uncertainty of
the Israelites about this unknown
substance, who called it raea ( “ what ")
“ for they whist not that it was."

Quails, which also served the is-
raelites for food in their wanderings
here, still frequent this desert, but
they are in very small numbers, and
always single birds.

Had I not been prevented visiting
Mount Sinai, and fulfilling m in-
tention of surveying that part J the
country, I might have spoken with
more conﬁdence of the ourneyings of
the israelites, and o the different
places where they encamped, during
their long sojourn there, as well as of
the objects must worthy of a visit in
this desert. But for all that portion

ance of some friends who have visited

After passing round the gulf, the
road crosses “ the track leading from
the ferry of Sues to the fountain of
Nibs, or, as it was called by the
Arabs, El Ghurkudeh, from which
that town is supplied with water for
drinking. From this point the foun-
tain is apparently three miles dis-
tant," and after an hour‘s march
along the coast you come to the Ain
Moose, or “ fountain of Moses.”
Here are some wild palm trees, and
a small spot of land irrigated by the
brackish water of its springs, and
cultivated by a few feilalu from Sues.
Some broken pottery, and a low
mound of rubbish. mark “ the site of
aformer village." In Wadee Sudr
are the head quarters of the Tarabeen
Arabs. t' who claim the whole terri.
tory from Opposite Sues to Wadee
Ght’trundel ;" and at the head of it is
the isolated pealt of That §udr,
which is a conspicuous point on the
road from Sues, and is seen from
the interior of the Egyptian desert.
Ain Howﬁrah is supposed to be the
Marsh of the lsraelites, where they
found “bitter" water, “ therefore
the name of it was called Ma-
ralt.” The water is brackish. and
“ somewhat bitter," and though no
stream ever ﬂows from the basin,
“ there are traces of running water
round about.”

Much has been said of the supposed
nature of the tree, which, when‘
Moses “ had cast into the waters ” of
Marsh, they “were made sweet ;“
and some have imagined it to be
the GhardeL, or GhurLud, which
abounds in these deserts. The red
irony of that bush is eaten, but is not
supposed to have any virtue in sweet-
ening water; though there is a tree
called yen-r, common in the Massee
desert, the seeds of whose long pods,
when eaten before drinkin , render
the taste ofwater peculisry sweet.
