have been founded by Menes, and
was enlarged and beautiﬁed by suc-

monarcha. Maris erected
themathern vestibule; and Seaostris,
besides the colossal statues above
mentioned, made considerable addi-
tions with enormous blocks of stone
which “ he employed his prisoners
of war to drag to the temple." Phe-
ron, his son. also enriched it with
suitable presents, which he sent on
the recovery of his sight, as he did to
all the principal temples of Egypt,
and on the south of the Temple of
Pthah were added the sacred grove
and Temple of Proteus. The west-
ern vestibule, or propylaum, was the
work of Rhempsinitua, who also
erected two statues, 25 cubits in
height; one on the north, the other
on the south ; to the former of which
the Egyptians gave the name of
summer, and to the latter winter.
The eastern was the largest and most
magniﬁcent of all these propyhea,
and excelled as well in the beauty
of its sculpture as in its dimensions.
It was built by Asychis.

Several grand additions were
afterwards made by Psamnticus, who,
besides the southern vestibule, erected
a large hypcthral court covered with
sculpture, where Apia was kept, when
exhibited in public. It was sur.
rounded by a peristyle of Osiride
ﬁgures, I? cubits in height, which
served instead of columns; similar
no doubt to those in the Memno-
nium at Thebes. l have endeavoured
to give an idea of the interior of this
court of Apis in my “ Manners and
Customs oi' the Ancient Egyptians.”

Many other kings adorned this
magniﬁcent temple of Pthah, with
sculpture and various gifts; among
which may bcmentioned the statue of
Sethos, in commemoration of his vic-
tory over the Assyrians, holding in
his hand a mouse, with this inscrip-

tion, “ Whoever sees me, let him he
pious.’ ’Amasis, too, dedicated a re-
cumbent colossus, 75 feet long, in
this temple; which is the more ain-
lar as there is no instance of an
.gyptian statue, of early time, in
that position.

According to Herodotus. “The
team or sacred grove of Proteus
was very heautifhl and richly orna-
mented. Some Phanicians of Tyre
settled at Memphis, lived round it,
and in consequence the whole neigh-
bourhood received the name of the
Tyrian camp. Within the tea-sacs
was the temple of Proteus, which was
called ‘0! Venus the stranger;"'
whence the historian conjectured that
it was of Helen, who was reported
to have lived some time at the court
of the Egyptian king. This is of
course an idle Greek story; which,
like so many others, shows how ready
the Greeks were to derive every thing
from their own country.

Strabo, in speaking of Memphis,
says, “ Near to the pyramids is Mem-
phis, the royal residence of the
Egyptians, distant three schemes from
the Delta. It has a temple of Apia,
who is the same as Osiris. Here the
bull Apis is kept in an enclosure, and
treated ass god. He has a white
mark on his forehead, and other small
spots on his body. the rest being
black ; and when he dies, another is
selected, from having certain si a,”
take his place. Before the cor osure
is a court, and another for the mother
of this bull. lie is permitted to go
out occasionally into the court, par-
ticularly when any strangers are de-
sirous of seeing him (at other times
being only seen through the windows
of his abode); and after he has
played about a little he is taken
back.

“The temple of Apia is close to
that of Vulcan (l'thah), which is
very magniﬁcent, both in size and
other respects. Before the drolaoe lies
a colossus of a singlestone; and in

,this space it iscustomary to have
