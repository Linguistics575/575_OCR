Eoorneh ; and to ascertain this fact,
Mr. Burton cleared it to the above-
mentioned distance, but he was
obliged to abandon his researches
owing to the danger of the mcphitic
air, which extinguished the lights.
It does not however appear, ft om the
direction it takes, to pass through the
mountain; nor is the spot one that
they would have chosen for such a
communication.

No. 21. is a small tomb without
sculptute, and unworthy of a visit.
F iagments of alabaster vases are met
with in one of the chambers

It appears that these open in the
time of the Ptolemies were Nos. 1, 2,
3, 4, 6, 7, s, ,9, 10, 11, 12, 14,
15, and 18, fourteen out of the
seventeen mentioned by Diodorus;
so that the three others have been
again closed since that epoch, unless
some of the unsculptured ones may
be admitted to complete the number,
which, from their being nnwonthy of
a visit, were also unworthy of an in-
scription to record the fact of their
existence. As that writer says, that
of the 47, only 17 were open in the
time of the Ptolemies, it appears that
more are now known than at that
period ; and I think I have observed
several places where other tombs
might be found in various parts of
this valley.

12. rue was'taax VALLEY.
There are four other tombs in the
western valley, behind that containing
these sepulchres. If the traveller is
pressed for time, he need not visit
them; but they are curious to those
who are interested in the foreign
kings of the family of Atinre- Bakhan.
One is of considerable size, but the
line of direction varies in three differ-
ent parts, the first extending to a dis-
tance of 145 feet, the second 1 19, and
the third 88, being a total of 352 feet
in length, with several lateral cham-
bers. The name is of Amunoph

Sect. IV.

111., of the vocal statue; and. con-
sequently, it is the oldest catacomb
ltilhEtiO discovered in these valleys,
except that marked W, 9. Towards
the end of the hut line of ditection is
a well now nearly closed, intended to
prevent the ingress of the rain-water
and of the too curious visiter; and
this deviation may perhaps indicate
the vicinity of another tomb behind
it.

It is perhaps in this valley that
other of the oldest royal catacombs
may some day be discovered, and it
certainly is singular that none have
been yet met with of the first kings
of the 18th dynasty.

There is one remarkable fact con-
nected with the tombs in the westetn
valley, that they are of kings who
appear to have belonged to a foreign
dynasty; the last of whom was Amu-
noph lll., who became one of the
Theban line, perhaps by right of
marriage, or by some patticular fa-
vour. That in features he was un-
like an Egyptian is evident; his re-
semblance to the strange kings, n hose
monuments are found at Tel el
Amarna and some other places, is
very striking; and the researches of
M. Prisse, at Karnalt, seem to de-
cide that he was of that family. The
discovery of the tombs in the western
valley would therefore be of great
interest; and it would perhaps give
some useful information respecting
the history of Egypt, and this most
culious point in the succession of the
Pharaohs.

W, 2. is 205 feet in length, in-
cluding the entrance, and contains
a broken sarcophagus, and some bad
fresco painting of peculiarly short
and graccless preportions. Of the
era of the king whose name here
occurs, I have only been able to as-
certain that he was prior to Remeses
IL, and probably by several reigns.
He appears to be called Eesa, or, as
some suppose, Shai. (See his namein
p. 393. Nos. 14, 15.)

The others are not worthy of notice.
