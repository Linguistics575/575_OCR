road also led from the upper part of
the Theba‘ld. The third station pre-
sents nothing of interest; and be-
tween it and the emerald mines no
other ruins occur, though several
wells once aﬂ‘orded a supply of
water to those who on the
road. This road which leaves the
Nile, nearly opposite Edfoo, is per-
haps the best for a visit to the sme-
rald mines and Berenice, especially
as the Ababdeh Arabs live there, who
are not to be engaged at Thebes, and
other places to the north.

The Bisharé'eh Tribe of Arabs. —
To the south of the Ababdeh Arabs
are the Bisharéﬁh, who, like the
Ababdeh, wear long hair, and have
the same wild appearance as the
Nubians and many other people of
Ethiopia. They have a peculiar lan-
guage, and call themselves desendants
of Kooks, who was both their god
and their ancestor; but they are
now Moslems. The Ababdeh had
also their own language formerly,
but they now speak Arabic.

The arms of both these tribes are
the spear, knife, and sometimes the
shield, which they prefer to ﬁre-arms.
They are frequently at war with each
other; and it is therefore necessary, in
going into their desert, to apply to
some of their shekhs for pretection.
But there is little there worthy of a'
visit ; the gold mines are of no great
interest, and it is difﬁcult to obtain
permission to see their stronghold,
the isolated mountain, called Gebel
el Elheh.

0n quitting Thebes, the dratruins
worthy of nouce are those of Era-st,
the ancient Her-month's. The princi-
pal object is a small tesuplqwﬂeh
appears to have been the Wet,
or “ lying-in-house,” be to a
large temple now destroy ; where
lteto, the second member of the
triad of the place, gave birth to Her-
pi-re, the infant childot‘ that goddess
and of Mandoo. It was built by the
celebrated Cleopatra, who is there
accompanied by Neocasar, or Casa-
rion, her son by Julius Cesar, and
consists of an exterior court, formed
by two rows of columns, connected by
intercolumnar screens, a small trans-
verse colonnade, serving as a portion,
at right angles with the former, and
the nsos, which is divided into two
chambers. Ptolemy Neocesar and
his mother have both the titles gods
Philometores, Philopatores; but the
offerings are mostly made by the
queen Cleopatra, who is also repre-
sented adoring Basis, the hull of
Hermonthis. This sacred animal is
found on the reverse of the coins of
the Hermonthite nome. Its head is
depressed, while that of Apis on the
Memphite coins is raised, which may
serve as a distinguishing mark when
the legend containing the name of the
nome has disappeared. I need scarcely
add that these are of the Roman em-
pire, the ancient Egyptians under the
Pharaohs having no coinage.

Strabo says that Apollo and Ju-
piter were both worshipped at Her-
monthis, and that the hull was also
held sacred in this city; but by
Apollo he doubtless means Mandoo,
who was the plincipal deity of the
place; and Jupiter was the Amun of
the Theba‘id. 1n the sculptures at
the back of the was are the cameleo-
pard and several Typhonian ﬁgures;
and' those of the interior are interest-
ing in a mythological point of view;
but their style is very inferior, and
proves that Egyptian sculpture had
already approached the era of its
downfall. Near it stood the other
larger temple, long since entirely de-
