mounds and crude brick ruins, are all
that remain of the city. It stood on
the Tanitic branch, and was a town
a some consequence till a late time,
and an episcopal see under the Lower
Empire. It is still occupied in part
by the modern village, which has re-
tained the ancient name.

During the winter months, after
the inundation, the canal is open from
Harbayt to Tania, but in February it
is closed again, at Koféor-Nigm below
Herinyt, and the only way of going
to Tania by water is from Mensaleh.

Between Hathayt and T nnis, the
only place wotthy of notice is Tel-
Fakltéos, the ancient Phacosn.

The usual route from the Nile to
the valley of the Nation Lakes, or
Wadee Natrt'ron. is front Teraneh.
The journey to Zalteeh, or Zultooh,
the most northerly inhabited spot in
the Natrun valley, occupies about I!
hours on camels.

The road, on quitting the Nile, at
the distance of about l| mile from
Terineh, passes over the ruins of an
ancient town, which have of late years
been turned up in every direction
for the purpose of collecting the ultra

that abounds in all similar mounds
throughout Egypt. These ruins are
of great extent, and apparently, from
the burnt bricks and small decomposed
copper coins occasionall found amidst
them, of Roman time. me columns,
one of which is about 2‘ feet in
diameter, have also been met with;
but no object of value has presented
itself to indicates place of much con-
sequence; and it is therefore probable
that its size was rather owing to its
having been the abode of the many
persons employed in bringing the
natron to the Nile, than to the im-
portanoe it possessed as an Egyptian
town. This Opinion is in some de-
gree conﬁrmed by the appearance of
a large road leading to it from the 8.
end of the Natron valley, which is
still used by those who. go from that
part of the country to the Convent of
St. Macarius. Though Terineh has
succeeded to, and derived its name
from, T etenuthis, it is probable that
these mounds occupy the site of that
ancient toan, and that its successor
was built More to the E. in conse-
quence of a change in the course of
the river. Momemphis and Mcnela‘i
nrhs also stood in the vicinity of Te.
renuthis; and the ancient road to
Nitriotis is said by Strabo to have left
the Nile not far from those places.

According toe rough observation, I
calculate the bank of the Nile at Te»
rt‘ineh to be about 58 feet above the
village of Zilteek. or 86 feet above
the surface of the Natron laltes.

The village of Zikeélt occupies the
site of what is marked in Colonel
Leslie's Map of Egypt as an ancient
glass-house. This is still visible bet
neath, and close to the house built
about seventeen years since by some
Europeans, who there established
works for dr ing the natron, and who
then founded the village, which now
contains 50 or 60 huts. and about
900 inhabitants of both seses. 11s.

time. it is built of stone. and the
