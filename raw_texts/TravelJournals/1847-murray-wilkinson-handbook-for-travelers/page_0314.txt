“ the prophet? foatstep,” said to be
preserved there. A large sandbank
has now been formed before it, so
that boats only pass close to the
mask during the inundation. A
short distance inland, to the east-
ward, is a river of late time, at
the southern extremity of a low ridge
of hills, which has received the not
uncommon name of Stabl Antar.
Here a powder magazine has lately
been established by the pasha; and on
the low ground beyond it to the east
are the remains of an aqueduct of
Arab construction, probably the one
mentioned by Pococlte. A long
reach of the Nile extends from Attar
e’ Nebbee to the village of e’ Dayr
“ the convent,” inhabited by Copt
Christians; and inland to the east is
the village of Bussateen, once famed
for its “ gardens,” whence its name,
but now scarcely known, except as
the resort of a troblesome set of
Arabs, the N'éim, who encamp upon
the plains in the vicinity. Near it is
the burial ground of the Jews, in the
sandy plain below the limestone bills
of the Mokuttum. That range is
here rent asunder by a broad valley
called Babr-bela-me, “ the river
without water,” which comes down
from the eastward, and measures to
its head about 8 miles. It separates
that part, called Gebel e’ Jooshee,
from the rest of the Molguttum
range.

The name Babr-bela-me (or mm) is
applied to several broad deep valleys,
both in the eastern and western
deserts, the most noted of which lies
beyond the Natron lakes.

One of the Suez roads, called Derb e’
Tarabéen, passes over this part of the
Mokuttum, and comes down to the
Nile by this valley to the village of
Bussateen; and immediately above
the brow of the cliﬂ‘on its north side
is the plain of petriﬁed wood (already
mentioned), as well as an ancient road
that led from Heliopolis over the
hills to this part of the country. (See

seem to watch the departure of the
traveller when he quits the capital,
as they welcomed his approach ﬁom
the Delta; and those of Abooaeer,
Saggira, and Dashéor, in succession,
present themselves to his view, and
mark the progress of his journey.
A little below Tours, on the east
bank, are some low mounds of earth,
probably ancient walls of decayed
crude bricks, belonging to an enclo-
sure, once square, but now partly
carried away by the river; and to the
east of it is another long mound,
through which a passage led to the
plain behind. The name of Toora
signiﬁes “a canal,” but it is more
likely to have been originally derived
from that of the ancient village that
once stood near this spot, called Troja.
or Tro'icus pagus; the conversion of
an old name into one ofsimilar sound
in Arabic being of common occur-
rence in modern Egypt.

The wall stretching across the
plain to the hills, and the fort above,
were built by Ismail Bey, whose
name they bear. On the recovery of
Egypt by the Turks under Ijassan
Pasha, in 1787, Ismé‘il Bey was ap-
pointed Shelth-Beled of Cairo; and
Murad, with the other Memlook
Beys, being conﬁned to Upper Egypt
this wall was erected to prevent their
approach to the capital. But Ismé’il
Bey dying of the plague in 1790,
Ibrahim and Murad shared Upper
and Lower Egypt between them till
the Fiench invasion.

A short distance to the south
of the fort, on the top of the same
range of hills, are the ruins of an
old convent, called Dayr el Bughleh
which is mentioned by Arab writers,
and was discovered a few years ago
by M. Linant.

El Magmh, or Toora - Maseru,
about 1} mile further to the south,
claims, with Toora, the honour of
marking the real site of the Tro'icus
pages, which, according to Strabo,
stood near to the river and the quar-
ries. Strabo and Diodorus both re-
port that it was built and named
