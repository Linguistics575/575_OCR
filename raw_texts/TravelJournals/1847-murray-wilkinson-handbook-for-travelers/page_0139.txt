The most remarkable town on this

road, in old times, was Canopus. The
zine on the way were Elcusis, a
'ttle to the south of Nicopolis, Ze-
phyrium, and Taposiria Parva. A
short distance beyond, totheeastof
Blends, was the canal that led to
Behedia; and on a promontory at
Taposiris was a chapel dedicated to
Venus Arsinoe.

In this place the town of Thonis
was reported to have stood. whose
name was detived from Thonis, the
king (or governor?) who entertained
Monelaus and Helen.

Pococke thinks the island a short
distance from the coast, to the east of
Abookir, is the promontory of Ta-
pairis, the successor of 'l‘honis, the
land having sunk and admitted the
sea, aoas to convert it into an island ;
and be there perceived some ruins,
the traces of subterraneous passages,
ands fragment ofa sphins. He also
mentions the ruins of an ancient tem-
ple under the water, about 2 miles
from Alexandria. whith he conjectures
to have belonged to Zephyrium. or
some other place on the road to Nico-
polis.

Canopus was 12 M.P., or accord-
ing to Strabo, 120 stadia (nearly H
En lish miles) from Alexandria, by
land. It stood on the west of the
CanOpic month, between which and
that town was the village of Hera-
cleum, famed for its temple of Her-
cules. The Greeks and Romans
imagined it to have been called after
Canopus, the pilot of Menelaus, who
was buried there; but its Egyptian
name Kahi-noub, or the “ golden
soil." and its high antiquity. suﬂlce to
show the folly of this assertion; which
is one of many instances of their mode
of changing a foreign name, in order
to connect it with, and esplain it by,
their own history. Canopus had a
temple of Serapis, who was the deity
worshipped there with the greatest re-

spect; and it is worthy of remark
that Mr. Hamilton discovered, amidst
the ruins of Alexandria, a Greek in-
scription in honour of “ Serapis in
Canopus.” The deity was supposed
to answer by dreams to the prayers of
his votariea, and persons of all ranks
consulted him, respecting the cure of
diseases, and the usual questions sub-
mitted to oracles. Many other tem-
ples also stood at CanOpus, as well as
numerous spacious inns for the re-
ception of strangers; who went to
enjoy its wholesome air, and, above
all, the dissipation that recommended

ments. Thither they repaired in
crowds by the canal for that object.
Day and night, the water was cos-er-
ed with boats, carrying men and wo-
men, who d:mced and sang uith the
most unrestrained licence. Arrived
at Canopus, they repaired to booths
erected on the banks, for the express
purpose of indulging in scenes of dis-
sipation. The immorality of the
place was notorious, and It is this
which led Seneca to say, “ no one in
thinking of a retreat would select
Connpus, although Canopus might
not prevent a man being virtuous."
