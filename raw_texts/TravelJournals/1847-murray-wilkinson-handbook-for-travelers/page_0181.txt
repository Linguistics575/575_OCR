The vvhole team is divided into
quarters, separated from each other
by gates, which are closed at night.
A porter is appointed to each, who is
obliged to open the door to all who
wish to pass through, unless there
is suﬁcient reason to believe them to
be improper persons, or not furnished
with a lamp, which every one is
obliged to carry after the E’slter.
The majority of these quarters consist
of dwelling-houses, and are known
by a name taken from some public
building, from some individual to
whom the property once belonged, or
from some class of persons who live
there: as the "art e‘ Suggain,
" quarter of the water-carriers ; " the
"art e’ Nassau, or "art el Kobt,
“ the Christian," or “ Capt, quarter ; "
the H art el Yehéod, “ Jews' quarter; "
the "art el Frang, “ Frank quarter,"
and the like.

The Capt quarter occupies one side
of the Ushekéih. It is built much on
the same principle as the rest of the
town ; but some of the houses are very
comfortably titted up, and present a
better appearance than is indicated by
their exterior. it has a gate at each
end, and others in the centre, tivo

of which are on the UabekéESh; but
these last are not opened, except as a
favour, to any one after the E'aher,
or ll hour alter sunset. The
quarter stands on the site of the old
village of El Make.

The cha’ quarter consists of nar-
rovv ditty streets or lanes, vrhile many
of the houses of the tvro opposite
sides actually touch each other at the
upper stories. The principal reason
of their being made so narrow is
to aﬂ'ord protection in case of the
quarter being attacked, and to faci-
litate escape when the houses have
been forced.

The Front quarter is usually known
to Europeans by the name of El M6s-
kee, supposed to be corrupted ﬂ‘om
El hliskavvee. This last is said to
have been given it in very early times
(according to some, in the reign of
Moes. the founder of the city). in
consequence of its being the abode of
the ureter-carriers ; and, according to
the same authority, when the city 'as
enlarged, and their huts were re-
moved to make way for better houses,
the streets, which extended through
this quarter (from what is new the
Derb el Barabra to the Iiornaowee
still retained the name of Beth e
Miskasree. This, liovvever, appears
not to have been the real origin of
