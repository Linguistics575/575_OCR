only 20 feet by l6, and it consists of
but one chamber. Re is of course
the principal divinity; and the God-
dess of Justice holds the most con-
spicuous place among the contemplar
deities.

The excavated temple was conse-
crated to Lucina by Physcon or Ener-

lI., the courts in front having
been built at a later period by Pto-
lemy Alexander I. ; who, with his
mother Cleopatra, added some of the
sculptures on the exterior of the sub-
teranean chamber. The front court
is composed of columns united by in-
tercolumnar screens, and opens by a
pylon on a staircase of considerable
length, having on each side a solid
balustrsde of masonry; and on the
face of the rock, to the east of the in-
ner court, is a tablet of the time of
the second Remeses, who presents an
offering to Re and Lucina.

I have been told by M. Prisse,
that on a rock beyond these two tem-
ples is another tablet, bearing the
name of lting Papi.

The temple of Amunoph III.
stands about a mile from these to the
eastward, in the same valley, between
two and three miles from the river.
And, from the circumstance of these
rttins being but little known to tra-
vellers who visit El Kab, it may not
he amiss to observe, that this building
hears about 70° east of north from the
ruined town of Eilethyss, and that
the two above mentioned, lying close
to the left of the road, may be visited
on the way.

This temple was also dedicated to
the goddess of Eilethyas. It consists
of a single chamber supported by four
columns, measuring 1 1 paces by 9, with
a paved platform on three sides, and
an open area in front, 8 paces by 17,
formed by columns and intercolumnar
screens; to which the pylon, con-
nected with the body of the temple
by a double row of columns, forms
the entrance.

The subjects of the interior are
mostly offerings made by king Amu-

nom 29.-—ms 10 seems.

and beyond, on the outside wall, is a
tablet of the forty-ﬁrst year of Reme-
ses IL, in which the fourth son of
that Pharaoh, a priest of Pthsb, is
attending his father in the capacity of
fan-bearer.

On returning from this ruin, and
following the bed of the valley, nearly
opposite the sons of Remeses, the
geologist may examine the numerous
ponds, on whose brink is found na-
tron, or subearbonate of soda.

Of all that Eilethyas now presents
to the antiquary, nothing can equal,
in point of interest, the grottoes in
the mountain to the north of the an-
cient town.

The ﬁrst sculptured tomb to the
eastward isthe most curious as a chro-
nological monument, since it con-
tains the names of several monarchs
who reigned at the commencement
of the eighteenth dynasty, from
Amosis to Amunoph 11.

Above it is a larger grotto, still in
good preservation, containing colour-
ed drawings relating to agricultural
and other occupations of the early
Egyptians. But the outlines of the
figures, and the subjects here de-
tailed, though so bigbly praised by
many travellers, are 0 a very inferior
style, and do not deserve similar en-
cominms when compared to those in
the private tombs of ﬁnerneh. They
are, however, highly interesting.

In the ﬁrst line of the agricultural
scene, on the western wall, the pea-
sants are employed in ploughi and
sowing; and from the car which is
seen in the ﬁeld, we are to infer that
the owner of the land (who is also
the individual of the tomb) has come
to overlook them at their work. In
the second line they reap wheat,
barley, and doéra ; the distinction
