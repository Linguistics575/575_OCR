the boy, who was ordered to look
stedfastly into the ink and report
whatever he should see. I begged
the magician to speak slowly enough
to give me time to wt ite down every
word, which he promised to do, with-
out being displeased at the request;
nor had he objected, during the pre-
liminary part of the performance, to
my attempt to sketch him as he sat.
He now began an incantation, call-
ing on the spirits by the power of
“ our Lord Soolaytnan,“ &c., with the
words tuyursltooa and hadderoo (be
present), frequently repeated. He
then muttered words to himself, and
tearing apart the different sentences
he had written, he put them one after
the other into the ﬁre together with
some frankincense. This done, he
asked the boy if any body had come.
—- Bor. “ Yes, many."—Maotcun.
“ Tell them to sweep."— B. “ Sweep."
— M. “ Tell them to bring the ﬂags."
— B. “ Bring the ﬂags." -— M.
“ Have they brought any ?" —- B.
“ Yes.” -— M. “ Of what colour?”
_ B. “ Green." —- M. “ Say, bring
another.” —- B. “ Bring another.”
— M. “ Has it come?”— B. “ Yes,
_a green one." —- M. “ Another."
— B. “ Another.” — M. “ Is it
brought? ”—B. “ Yes ; another green
one —- they are all green.” — M.
“ What now ?”— B. “ Another; half
white, half red.” —M. “ Bring an-
other."—- B. “ Bring another.”—M.
“ Heh ?”—B. “ He has brought a
black one; all black."—M. “ An-
other.”--B. “Another; here it is;
there are ﬁve."-—M. “ Another."—
B “ Bring another; here it is, all
white."-—-M. “ Bring one more.”—
B. “ Bring one more.”—M. “ Well?”
—B. “ He has brought one more,
green."— M. “ Bring the sultan’s
tent.”—-B. “ They have brought it,
but have not yet put it up."— M.
“ Order them to pitch it and lay down
diwans.”— B. “ They have put it
up, and have brought diwans; here
Comes the sultan on a black horse, and
he alight: and sits on a throne."—

CAIRO. — THE MAGICIAN.

 

Sect. II.

Finding the boy very ready with his
answers, I said to him, “ Have I not
seen you perform before '1’” He said,
“ Yes, I have done it before often."—
M. “ What do you see now?"—-B.
“ He is washing his hands.”-—M. “ Is
a soldier before him ?”— B. “ Yes.”
— M. “ Have they brought coffee?”
— B. “ They have ; and he drinks—
put me some more ink.”

This being done, the magician asked
who would call for some one. Mr.
Lewis called for his father by name.
— M. “ Say to the chowish, ‘ Chowish,
bring Frederick Lewis before me that
I may see him ?' Well ! ”— B. “ Here
he is, dressed in black, short and fat,
of a white colour, with no heard, but
ntustaches, wearin a tarboosh and
red shoes.” The description of this
person was as unlike as the last part
to a European dress. The magician,
on being told this, said, “ Let him
go. " The boy repeated this order,
and said, “ I tell the truth as he ap-
pears.”

I suggested that the magician, hav-
ing once caused Shakspeate to be so
well desmibed, ought to have the
same power of doing it again with a
different boy, and I asked for him.
——M. “ Say, Chowish, bring Shak-
speare."-B. “ Bring Shakspeare.”
— M. “ Is he come ?"-— B. “ Yes;
he is short, fat, dressed in black, with
aehild standing by him; he has a
beard." Somebody asked if he had
any thing round his neck. B. “ Yes;
a handkerchief, red. He has a black
beard, no In ustaehes, a black high hat. "
Some one asked if it was like a com-
mon hat. B. “ A hat with a band
round it; he wears red shoes, has
nothing in his hand, Arab trowsers,
and a aizdm dress, and a black uizdm
coat, with a red shawl round his
waist, a stick in his hand, many peo-
ple near him, and a little boy dressed
in white, an Arab dress, tarboosh, and
red shoes."—M. “ Let him go—is
he gone?"—- B. “ Yes.”

Lord Anglesey was then called
for. The boy described him as “an
