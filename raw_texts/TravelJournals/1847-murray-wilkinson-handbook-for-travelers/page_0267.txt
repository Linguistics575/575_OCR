town of Mansoora. It is much nar-
rowertbsnthoseof Moiisand Kari-
nsyn, being only about 70 or 80 feet
broad, and in the neighbourhood of
Mensaleh much lcn. It winds very
much, which, if the wind is not
favourable, may delay a host along
time. both in going to and coming
from Mensaleh; and this perhaps
renders the route to Tanis by Zeke-
aeek and Bubastis preferable. (See
Route 13.) It contains water the
whole year; but after April is only
navigable as far as Tel e' Nassara.

The point of land on the N. of the
and, where it joins the Nile, oppo-
site Msnsoors. is memorable from
having been the spot where the Cru-
saders had their camp in 1221, and
again in 1250.

Near Alenger, a village ahout 2
leagues to the N. of Mansoors, a

Itaﬂet deoneh is. perhaps, the best
point of departure in summer for a
visit to the ruins of Tel et Mai in the
plain to the southward; and durin
the high Nile it may be approach
by water to within a short distance.

Tel ehMai occupies the site of
Thmuis; which is at once pointed
out by its Arabic name, as well as by
the Coptic Thmoui. A large mono-
lith is still standing on the site of
Thmuis. It is of granite. and mes-

and ll ft. 7 in. deep; and within. it
is l9 ﬂ. 3 in. high, ‘3 ﬂ. broad. and

mention seems to be made of the gods

says that Titus, on his way from
Alexandria to Judea passed by
Thmuis. lie went by land to Nico-
POIiO. and then putting his troops on
board long ships. went up the Nile
by the Mendesian province to the
city of 'l'hmuis.

nothing of interest. The only re-

of a few small broken columns, frag-

occurs between this and Mensaleh.
Mit e' Nasser-oh probably occupies
the site of an ancient town, judging
from its distinctive appellation "of

the style of its houses, its broken
