The succeﬁm of the in ﬁrst (A,

of Adore-Hakka (D) has been
ascertained, it appears to me that P
and G should follow them, the latter.

of Amuuoph III., and threfore the
last of those foreign princes. As 1

western valley of Thebes.

Nos. 90. and 9|. are uncertain.
The ﬁrst is from a ring belonging to
Mr. Burton, and theotberfromthe
handle of a vase I foundat Tel el
Amarna. Nos. 7. IO. 13. and 19.
are namesof queens belonging to the
kings they accompany, and 16. is
the square title or banner preﬁxed
to the oval of this king. A is
from the third propyla ol' Kamak,
and E from a grotto at Tel el
Amarna.

The interesting inquiry to which
the discovery of the above names has
led, induces me to mention them
more particularly, in order to invite
the attention of travellers to the sub-
ject, and to show the importance of
any observations they may have it in
their power to make, respecting the
succession and history of these stranger
princes; and no opportunity should
be allowed to pass of copying hiero-
glypbics that contain their ovals.

Other monarchs have added sculp-
ture to different parts of the two areas
before and behind these propyla ; and
we here ﬁnd the names of Remeses
II. and III., with some other early
Pharaohs.

To the south-east of them is a late
or spacious reservoir, lined with ma-
sonry, which still receives the water
of the rising Nile, as it oozes through
the ground; and on its banks are a
few small ruins, of the late epoch of
Pssmmouthis, of the 29th dynasty
(warm 25" 26., 27s).

The small ediﬁce attached to the
front area is of the second Amunoph,

The ruins within the crude-brick
enclosure of the other-meme labs,
are of various epochs; and among the
sculptors: are observed the names of
Thothmes 11L, Amunoph III., She-
sbonk 1., and Ptolemy Dionysus.
The temple ('1‘, 3.), and statues,
which once stood before it, are of
Remeaes II. ; and that on thevvesteru
corner of the lake, also adorned with
two granite statues, is o! Remeaas
Ill. Numerous ﬁgures of black
granite, representing the lion-headed
goddess, are deposited in the precincts
of the inner enclosure; and some ele-
gant androsphinxes, on the left of the
front door, are worthy of notice.

The water of this lake also receives
an annual supply, through the soil,
from the Nile; but being strongly
impregnated with nitre, and other
salts, and stagnant during the heat of
the summer, it is no longer drink-
able.

The sculptures of the pylon
(No. 21.), behind the great temple,
have never been completed. In the
doorway is the name of Nectaneho,
and on the upper part of the south-
east side those of Ptolemy Philadel-
phus, and of Arsiuo'e’, his sister and
second wife.

In the area, within this gateway,
are a few other remains, of the time
of Osirei, Remeses II. (No. 19.),
Tirhaka (No. 90.), Ptolemy Physcon,
Dionysus, and Tiberius. The com-
mencement of it, however, dates from
the earlier era of the third Thothmes,
as the statues placed against the wall
of circuit of the great temple have
the name of that Pharaoh (No. 18.).
By the same monarch was founded
the small ediﬁce on the east of the
