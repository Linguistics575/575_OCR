to a chamber near the adytum. They 1
are very singular. In the centre is a
sort of pillar, passing below the level
of the picture, which I could not
trace to the bottom, having come to
water after digging a few inches.
Another block is of some importance,
as it gives the deity of the place, who,
it is always supposed, had a lion's or
cat‘s head, and whose name
occurs so often on menu-
ments about the pyramids. -
The columns, at least in the

vestibule, had lotus-bud (or papyrus-

bud) capitals, in the ancient Egyptian

style; but close to the landing-place

is another, said to have been taken

many years ago from this temple,

which has the palm capital. This,

like the blocks in the temple, has the

ovals of Remeses the Great, over

which Osorkon has cut his name;

but what is singular, the goddess of

the city is nowhere mentioned upon

it; and the principal deity who gives

“ life" to the Pharaoh, is the square-

eared Omho, “the son of Netpe."

This column, when entire, was about

92 feet long, with a diameter of 9

feet 8 inches, and was probably in

the portico, or an inner part of the

temple. .

In these and other ruins of the
Delta certain peculiarities may be ob-
served, in which they differ from
those of Upper Egypt. In the latter
the walls of the temples are sand-
stone, and the columns built of several
pieces, and granite is conﬁned to
obelisks, statues, doorways, and to the
adyta of some remarkable monu-
ments: in the Delta the temples
themselves are in gleat part built of
granite, and the porticoes and ves-
tibules have columns of a single
block of the same materials; which,
as far as I remember, have not been
met with in any part of the upper
country.

The temple of Mercury is in a
still more ruinous state than that of
Pasht: afew red granite blocks are
all that remain of it, and one only

presents a few imperfect hierogly-

In the town, the plans of some of the
houses may be traced, as well as the
directions of some of the streets and
alleys, varying from 14 feet 6 inches,
to 7 feet; as the rooms of some
houses vary from 26 feet by 14, to 7
feet square. H ere and there are some
narrow chambers, or recesses, like
cofﬁns, which might be intended for
the sepulture of the sacred animals.
I looked in vain for the bones of cats;
but some human bones are met with
among the crude brick ruins to the
W. of the temple, where one small
building has the form of a pyramid,
either the work of man or worn into
that shape by the rain. On that side
is a large enclosure of crude brick,
268 feet square, with walls 90 feet
thick, which appears to have been a
fort, with one entrance on the temple
side., On the N. of it was a narrow
street. Many of the houses of Bu-
bastis have been burnt, as at Thebes,
Sa'is, and other places; and on the 3.
side are some large mounds reddened
by ﬁre, and fragments of pottery. On
the way you pass some very large cir-
cular pits, with square margins of
crude-bliclt.

To the N. E. a very large open
space lay between thew all of the town
and the houses, which is now a cul-
tivated plain; and at one end of it
stood the temple of Mercury.

At Zakaseeig are a bridge and
sluices, which require a change of
boats in going this way to Tanis.
Here too the present canal to Tel el
Wadee, once the famous canal of
Arsino'é, commences; and it is re-
markable that this, whose month has
been so often changed, and taken
more and more to the southward,
should return at last to the vicinity of
Bubastis, near which, Herodotus says,
it was ﬁrst opened.

to which it gave its name, is between
