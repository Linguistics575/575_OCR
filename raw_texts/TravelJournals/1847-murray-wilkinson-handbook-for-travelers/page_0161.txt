A cangia may he hired at from
1000 to 1300, which used to be the
price of a dahabéiih when the wages
of sailors were 25 piastrcs a month.
There is a entail kind of cangia, sel-
dom with more than one cabin, only
high enough to admit of persons
kneeling in it, which may be had at a
lower rate, perhaps 700 piastres a
month; but this implies a reduction
in the number of men; and it has
this discomfort, that no one can pass
from one side of the boat to the other
without making it heel over. It has,
however, the advantage of being easily
tracked, when the wind fails, and is
quickly rowed down the stream on
returning. Another species of cangis,
called sandal, with one mast and one
cabin, may also be rated at the same
price as the last mentioned.

The contracts are usually written
at the consulate, as few travellers un-
derstand suﬂicient Arabic, or the cus-
toms of the country, to do without a
translation, or to have it drawn up by
a public scribe. They are generally
worded like the following: —

" Taanstartort non 'rna Aaaalc.

“Saturday the 20th of the month
of Showal, of the year 1251 (4th Dec.
18“,) Mr. —, an Englishman, has
taken on hire from the réis (ryis)
of the town of ( Boolek belonging to
—-——), a cangia of about
ardebs burthen, for a voyage on the
Nile, during such length of time as it
may please the above to keep the said
boat. It is to be manned by
sailors, not including the reis, and the
sails, ropes, oars, &C. are to be in good
condition.

“ The hire agreed upon is—pias.
tres a month, without any further
charges, to begin from the date of
the present contract, which is in every
thing agreeable to law.

“ The rti’is and sailors are to he
obedient to the orders of the hirer,
during the night as well as the day,
but it is understood that they will not
be obliged to tow the cangia after
dark, unless necessity requires it.

 

 

 

BOATS.

“ The sailors are to be full—grown,
able-bodied men, understanding their
work, and two of them are to keep
watch during the night, when the boat
is at anchor. If the boat passes the
cataracts, the charges made for them
by the re'is of the cataracts will be
defrayed by the hirer.

“ This agreement is signed (one
month's pay having been given in
advance) by the two parties in pre-
sence of the witnesses.

It may be as well to make the refs
understand that he is not to take any
other passengers, or merchandise of
any kind, that the whole boat shall
be at the traveller's command, that
the sailors shall be obedient to orders,
and that no one shall quit the boat
on the pretext of visiting relatives, or
with similar pleas, without previously
asking permission.

Some abuses have crept in of late,
which ought to be put a stop to.
being unjust to travellers (who now
pay unheard-of prices for boats), con-
trary to the customs of the country,
and likely to pave the way for many
others. One is the attempt to make
the hirer of a boat responsible for any
accident that may happen on passing
the cataracts, which has even been in-
troduced into written contracts. This
is both unjust and absurd. It was
never heard of till of late, and no
Turk or native would take a boat
under such conditions. Besides, the
.as of the cataracts is placed there
on purpose to pass boats, and at his
risk; and certainly nothing can be
more ridiculous than for the traveller
to remove that responsibility from the
ré‘is of the cataracts, and nothing more
unjust than for any one to take ad-
vantage of his inexperience to put
him into this position. it should be
resisted by all means, and the boats
of those who refuse to allow them to
pass the cataracts should not be hired
at all, unlets they agree repay the hire
