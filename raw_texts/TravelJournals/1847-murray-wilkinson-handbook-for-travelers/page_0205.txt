The balsam plants are said to have
been brought from J udca to this spot
by Cleopatra; who. trusting to the
inﬂuence of Antony, removed them,
in spite of the opposition of Herod,
having been hitherto conﬁned to
Judaa. Josephus tells us that the
lands where the balsam tree grew
belonged to Cleopatra, and that
“ Herod farmed of her what she
possessed of Arabia, and those reve-
nues that came to her from the region
about Jericho, bearing the balsam, the
most precious of drugs. which grows
there alone." This is the Balm of
Gilead mentioned in the Bible. The
plants were in later times taken from
Mataré'éh to Arabia, and grown near
Mecca, whence the balsam is now
brought to Egypt and Europe, under
the name of Balsam of Mecca; and
the gardens of Heliopolis no longer
produce this valuable plant. In the
houses of the village are several frag-
ments of stone bearing parts of hiero-
glyphic sentences, which have been
removed from the old town or the
tombs in the vicinity; and many pieces
of petriﬁed wood lie scattered in the
ﬁelds, and at the edge of the desert,
