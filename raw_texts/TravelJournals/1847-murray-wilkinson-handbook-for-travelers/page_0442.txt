anus, occurring in the dedication 1
over the entrance; and those of Tra-
jan, Adrian, and Antoninus, in the
interior. Mention is also made of
Thothmes III., by whom the original
temple was perhaps founded.

0n the ceiling is a zodiac, similar
to that of Dendera; and upon the
pilasters, on either side of the front
row of columns, are several lines of
hieroglyphics, which are interesting
from their containing the names of
the Egyptian months.

Extensive mounds sumciently
prove the sire and consequence of
ancient Latopolis ; but no remains are
now visible, except the portico and a
stone quay on the east side. That
the latter is of Roman date may be
inferred from the st le of the build-
ing; and I may ad , in conﬁrmation
of this conjecture, that Mr. Bankes
is said to have discovered a Greek
inscription upon it, mentioning the
time of its erection.

Esné has become the place of exile
for all the Almelu, and other women
of Cairo, who offend againstthe rules
of the police, or shock the prejudices
of the Ulemas. The learning of these
“learned women" has long ceased;
their poetry has sunk into absurd
songs; their dancing would degrade
even the motes Janina of antiquity;
and their title Alma); has been changed
to the less respectable name of Choco-
dzee, or women of the Memloolts. In
1832 the Pasha permitted them pub-
licly to exercise their vocation in
Cairo, and the Almeh's dance was
allovted to satisfy the curiosity of
strangers, or the taste of the inhabi-
tants. But the doctors of Islam took
alarm, the goverment was obliged to
give up the annual tax levied upon
this class of the community, and their
dancing was forbidden. And such
is the consistency of these modern
Pharisees, that they, in the true spirit
of attaining at gnats and swallowing
camels, permit men publicly to as-
sume the dress of women, and dance

some 29. —- rmss 10 noon.

Wansleb mentions the tombs of
Christian mart who were buried

near Bane, an whom some suppose
to have been put to death during the
persecutions of Diocletian. But they
aredoubtless the same, who are re-
ported to have ﬂed from Medéenet
Haboo at the time ofthe Arab inva-
sion, and to have been overtaken end
and slain at this spot.

Near the village of El Hench. on
the opposite bank, stood the smell
townof Contra Locos, whose siteis
marked by a temple of the time of
Cleopatra Cocceand Ptolemy Lethy-
rus; but the sculptures were not
completed till the reigns of Aurelius
and Commodus.

It has a portico, 98 feet by 19, with
four columns in front, and two in
depth, beyond which are one central
and two lateral chambers, the former
10 feet by 16; and this last is suc-
ceeded by an inner room, probably
the sanctuary. But from the whole
of the back part being ruined, its ori-
ginal extent is now doubtful.

The subcarbonate of soda, natron,
is found in the vicinity of El Helleh.
The Ababdeh also bring from the
eastern desert a talcose stone, called
hm, for which there is a great de-
mand throughout Upper Egypt, being
peculiarly adapted to the manufacture
of the birém. or earthen vessels for
cooking, which have the power of
resisting a great degree of heat, and
are universally ustd by the peasants.
The hamr is ﬁrst pounded and sifted;
and, after being moistened and mixed
with brick-dust, is fashioned with the
hand, and baked in a kiln heated
to a preper temperature. But they
have not yet become acquainted with
the process of vitrifying their pottery,
and the glazed earthenware now used
in Egypt is imported from foreign
countries.

0n the west bank, seven miles
above Esné, are mounds of an old
town, now called Kom Ayr.

A short distance above El Kendn,
and about fourteen miles from Esné,
