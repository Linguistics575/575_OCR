The boats of the Nile are the djerm
(germ), the meadil, aggub (akigub),
maash or rahleh, dahabé‘éh, cangra
(gangeh), ky‘s (kyiselu) §£ndal, sefée-
nee, garib (kirib), and maadééh. The
lar t are the germs, which are only
it on the Nile during the inunda-
tion, or between Alexandria, Rosetta,
and other ports on the Mediterranean.
Theycarry from 800 to about 9000
ardebs; but four have been built at
Osioot which are rated at 4800
ardebs; and to give some idea of
their sise, a boat of 950 ardebs mea-
sures 85 feet in length and 10 or 12
in breadth. They have two masts
and large lateen sails, like the gene-
rality of the boats on the Nile. They
are only employed for carrying corn,
and during the summer are laid up,
covered with mate, to protect them
from the sun. The maidil, or, as it
is sometimes called, kyas, is of a very
similar construction, but smaller, car-
rying from 150 to 800 srdebs. The
aggub is only used for carrying stone,
and is singular among the boats of the
Nile for its square sail.

The last ﬁve are open boats. The
name of sandal is chieﬂy applied to
a small kind of cangia, and to ships'
boats, or those attached to the gun-
boats of the Nile; the garib is the
ﬁshing-boat, and the maadéiih the
ferry; but the maash, dahahé'éh, and
cangia, are the three peculiarly adapt-
ed for travelling on the river, being
furnished with cabins.

The maash, or, more properly,
rﬁhleh, is convenient from its large
and lofty cabins; but unless a tra-
veller has .plenty of time to spare, a
dahabé'éh is far preferable; and many
of these are now so large as to yield
very little to the rﬁhleh in the comfort
of their cabins, added to which they
are always cleaner. The traveller who
has time to spare, and intends making
a long sojourn at Thebes, may take
a rahleh to go up the Nile, send it

05' at Thebes, and write to Cairo for 4

a dahabé‘éh or cangia; or, if he does
not object to the expense, he may take
both with him, and, paying 03' the
rihleh at Asouan, use the smaller boat
to pass the cataracts and return to
Cairo.

The dahabé'éh differs only from the
cangia in its greater size, and in hav-
ing a plank, or gangway, at the side
of the cabin windows extending to
the steerage. They vary in size. The
large ones have generally two cabins
and a smaller room, called a bath, in
all which a short man may stand nearly
upright; and some persons have added
to the hei ht of the cabins b low-
ering the car. The large-sis daha-
bé'e'hs let at from 2000 to 8000 piastr'es
a month; smaller ones at from 1000
to 1350, which last is about the sum
paid for a large cangia. It is difﬁcult
to distinguish between the cangia and
dahabé’éh, as they are so very like each
other, when of the same size, that no
deﬁnite line can be drawn between
them; generally speaking, therefore,
the prices of all this class of boats
may be reckoned at from 1000 to
8000 piastres a month. In all cases
the price varies with the number of
the men, whose pay is as follows :—
