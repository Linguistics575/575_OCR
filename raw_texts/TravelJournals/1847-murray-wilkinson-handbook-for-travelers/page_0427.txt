Nopart, in my opinion, remeinsof
the earliest foundation of the temple;
but the name of Osirtasen suﬂces to
support its claim to an antiquity
surpassing that of every other build-
ing in Thebes. by at least one hundred
years. The original sanctuary.

doubtless existed in, and previous to
the reign of that monarch, and stood
on thesite ofthepresent one, (mar-led
9.)—-an opinion conﬁrmed by om
ﬁnding the oldest remains in that di-
rection, as well as by the propor-
tions of the courts and propyla, whose
dimensions were necessarily made to
accord with those of the previous
parts, to which they were united.
All is here on a limited scale, and
the polygonal columns of Osirtaeen
evince the chute style of architecture
in vogue at that early era. (See No.
19. of the ground plan.)

Subsequently to his reign were
added the small chambers of Amu-
noph I. —the obelishs of Tbothmes
I. —the great obelisks, and the
rooms near the sanctuary, of Amun-
neitgori (No. l9.)— and on the
corresponding side those of Thoth-
mes II.

They constituted the main part of
the temple at that period. The suc-
ceeding monarch, “othmes 1 IL.
made considerable additions to the
buildings and sculptures, as well in
the vicinity of the sanctuary as in the
hnck part of the great enclosure;
where the columnar ediﬁce above
mentioned, the side chambers, and
all the others in that direction, were
added by his orders.

The sanctuary destroyed It the
Persians, and since rebuilt by ilip
Arida-us, was also of the same Pha-
raoh; who seems to have been the
ﬁrst to build it of red granite; and a

The wall No.11. is double, the
inner part bearing the name of
Amunneitgori, the actual face that of
Thothmes “1., who presents to the
godof Thebesavarietyofoﬂ'erings;
among which are two ohelisks, and
two lofty tapering stal's, similar to
those attached to the propyla. At
the close of his reign the temple only
extended to the smaller obelislts; be-
fore which were added, by Amunoph
111., the p yla (D), whose re-

the north-west face.

The propyla to the south-west were
already erected in the reignsof the
Thothmes, as I shall have occasion
to remark presently.

In the third reign after Amunopb,
the grand hall (C) was added by
Osirei, the father of Remeses 11.,
about l380 s.c.; and besides the
innumerable has-reliefs that adorn its
walls, historical scenes, in the most
ﬁnished and elegant style of Egyp-
tian sculpture, were designed on the
exterior of the north-east side.

In thenest reign other grandad-
ditions were made by the son of the
last monarch, who completed the
sculptures on the south-west side of
the grand hall, and on the exterior of
the wall of circuit. llealsobuilt the
