part of the harbour, about due W.
and due N. of the Catacombs, is 10,
10}, and in one place 11 fathoms;
close in, to within 200 feet of the
shore, it is from 4 to 6; and under
the town itself, at little more than 1
cable’s length off, 8 and 4 fathoms.

The steamer anchors alongside a
large boat moored there as a coal
depot: and shoals of boats come off
to take the newly arrived strangers
with their baggage ashore. When
the packet is full of passengers, there
is frequently great confusion with
the lug e, which is piled up and
so mix in one general mass, that it
is diﬁcult for any one to ﬁnd his
own: a traveller should therefore
take care to have it all put together
when he embarks, particularly if he
has much; and should go, or send
his servant, a short time before he
reaches Alexandria, to see that it is
in one place and accessible, to escape
a disagreeable scramble at the last
moment.

If he has paid his passage at
the oﬂice, and arrangements have
been made for landing his things,
it is unnecessary to take further
trouble about them beyond seeing
that they are all safe: and the Carcass
employed by the Company will un-
dertake to pass them at the Custom
House.

When a passenger has paid before-
hand for the expenses of landing his
luggage and Custom House fees, the
Cavéss has no further claim on him;
but in order to give some idea of the
charges made in other cases by this
functionary, it may be said that the
ordinary sum paid him, for taking

the luggage of two persons from the.

vessel to the hotel, is 33 piastres,
which includes the host, one camel,
and the Custom House fee, and is
nearly twice as much as it ought
to be.

consequently no previous arrange-
ments have been made, or if he does

not apply to the Company’s Cawﬁss
for this purpose, the traveller will be
obliged to hire a boat for himself, or
with some other passenger, and go to
the Custom House, where a small fee
will enable him to pass his luggage
without examination 3 provided it has
the appearance of containing solely
personal eti‘ects, and does not consist
of large cases, which have the cha-
racter of merchandise. The hire of a
boat ought not to be more than 3, or
at most 5, piastres, though the boat-
men will not be contented with double
that sum; and the Custom House fee
may be from 6 to 10 piastres, accord-
ing to the quantity of things. Wine
and spirits pay a duty, as well as all
merchandise, but a small quantity for
private use is passed under the title of
luggage-

There is at present some difﬁculty
respecting the question of duties.
According to the treaty of Balta
Limﬂn, all goods are to pay 5 per
cent. 3 that is, 8 on entering the ports
of Turkey, and 2 on leaving them for
the interior; which of course exempts
them from further examination at any
inland towns. In virtue of this, wine
and spirits are free from every other
duty, hitherto levied upon them at
Cairo and other places. The treaty
is very explicit in its conditions
respecting the duties, the abolition
of monopolies and the right given to
all Europeans of purchasing the pro-
duce of the country, and exporting it
without impediment on the payment
of an ad calm-em duty; notwithstanding
which it is constantly evaded.

of human beings, in the shape of
donkey drivers. Their active little
animals may be called the cabs of
Egypt; and each driver, with vehe-
