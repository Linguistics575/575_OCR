dosed pa-age, or a pyramid covered
with a smooth inaccessible casing,
were intended for an observatory, yet
the form of the exterior might lead to
many useful calculations. They stand
exactly due north and south, and
while the direction of the faces,
east and west, might serve to ﬁx the
return of a certain period of the year,
the shadow cast by the sun atthe
time of its coinciding with their slaps,
might be observed for a similar pur-

pose.

The angle of the face was 52°, or,
according to Colonel Howard Vyse's
more minute measurement, 51° 50’;
and that the pyramids presented a
smooth exterior surface (generally,
though perhaps not quite correctly,
called the casing) is very evident, not

only from the portion that still remains .

In Pliny's time, both the pyramids
seem still to have had this exterior tier
of stones, which was probably not
stripped off until the time of the ca-
liphs; and according to the account
of ancient writers, the people of the
neighbouring village of Busiris were
paid by strangers for climbing them,
as the [elicits of El Kafr now are, for
going over the smooth art of the
second pyramid. Di orus also
speaks of rude steps, cut on the side
of that of Cephren, the whole, no
doubt, being then covered with a
smooth exterior; and if we may be-

It covered an area of about 57! '536
square feet.

Thelength of each face, when entire,
was 7560 feet by measurement.

Its perpendicular height, when en-
tire, was 4809 feet by calculation.

Its present base was 7890 feet by
measurement.

Present perpendicular height was
460'9 feet by calculation.

Present area was 535694 square
feet.

It has been said to cover the same
space as Lincoln's Inn Fields; which
is not far from the truth, judging
from a rough calculation of paces, by
which -I found the area of that place
to contain about 550,000 square feet,
the breadth being more one way than
the other. The solid contents of the
pyramid have been calculated at
85,000,000 cubic feet; and it has been
computed that there is space enough
in this mass of masonry for 3,700
rooms of the same site as the king's
chamber, leasing the contents of every
second chamber solid, by way of sepa-
ration. Colonel Howard Vyse gives
the following measurements: —

I am far from pretending that my
own measurements are more correct
than the above, which have been taken
with so much care, and by persons so
capable of the task; but such is the
diﬂiculty of measuring the ill-deﬁned
exterior of the pyramid, that no two
measurements a rec, and, if taken
along the groun , can seldom be de-
pended on. I may therefore state the
manner in which my measurements
