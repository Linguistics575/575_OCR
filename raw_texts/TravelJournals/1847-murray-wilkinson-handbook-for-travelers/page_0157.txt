loohed upon as a favour, and a re-
wud for good behaviour; and the only
thing required of the-master is a pair
of shoes everyithree months, if em-
in much out-of-doors service.
t is as well not to trust too much

to the honesty of servants.

Among the servants of Egypt,
some of course possess recommen-
dations, which make them preferable
for the traveller; as, besides honesty
and activity, a knowledge of Upper
Egypt, of the requisites for a jour-
ney, and of the habits and languages
of Europeans, are indispensable. It
cannot be supposed that all the com-
parative escellencies of each are sufﬁ-
ciently known, to enable me to point
out those who are positively the best ;
but without excluding others from the
merit of possessing proper qualifica-
tions, I may mention the names of
some, who, from having been long in
the service of travellers, are particu-
larly deserving of recommendation:
as Hagee Suloytnﬁn. formerly catvéss
of the British and Sardinian consu-
lates; Mahméod; Mohammed Abd el
A'tee, another Mohammed, who was
a long time with Mr. Burton; and
Mohammed Ahtleen; who are per-
haps the best in the country. But
the best, both for the Continent as
well as the East, is a Neapolitan,
named Vinccnso Braico.

The horses of Egypt are not an
Arab breed, nor have they the points
most peOple expect to meet with in
the East. They are a race peculiar
to the country, which, though not
possessing the characteristics of the
thorou h-bred Arab and English
horse, ts not deﬁcient in some essen-
tial recommendations. They are low,
usually about 14 to Hi hands, with
small heads. line crests (but short
neck), strong shoulders, good barrel,
and well ribbed up, hind uarters
clumsy, and legs heavy, wi short
pasterns. They are very docile and
good tempered, has best admirably,

being accustomed to be tethered out
all day in the sun, and live hardily.
Their food is barley, and they are
only watered once a day, about 8
r. st. Once every year they are
turned out to clever, without which
they suffer from an eruption of the
skin, or some other disease. Their
paces are the wall: and gallop, being
seldom taught to trot; but an ant-
bling pace is sometimes given them,
by tying the legs together; which is
sogreataa; ‘ ‘tieninahorse
or mule, that they often sell for dou-
ble the sum of those with ordin
paces. A horse thus trained is called
Rahw‘n. The Egyptian horses are
not good ieapers, and are unable to
gallop for a long distance; so that
they would be of very little use in
hunting, if such an amusement es-
isted in Egypt; but for a short dis-
tance their gallop is quick and strong,
and being very manageable, their rap
pidity of movement is very available
in playing the gene! or throwing the
lance. 'l‘his graceful and manly es-
etcise is now seldom seen, and will
soon be mentioned among by-gone
pastimes, like tilting and archery.
Horses sell at Cairo from about
700 to ‘2000 piastres; in Upper
Egypt, as low as 300 and 400; and
mules end rained” fetch the same
prices. Asses are also sold, when of
unusual size, at from 500 to ”(D
piastres, and a common hoes donkey
from to to 500. Asses are verycon-
venient in Cairo for passing through
the crowded streets, and are the cabs
of the place; Christians seldom use
any other animals, partly from more-
nience, partly from old habit, not
having been allowed before the be n-
ning of the present century to ' e a
horse ; and the Copts are in possemiou
of the best breed. Mules and rah-
a-éar are thought more convenient
than horses for the city, and are al-
ways used by old men, shehhs of the
religion, and inactive people, who like
to ride without tirin themselves; and
as nobody walks, it iaau object to
