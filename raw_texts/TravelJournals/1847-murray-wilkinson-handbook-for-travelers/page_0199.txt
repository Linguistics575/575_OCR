built another at the village of Ben-
benooda, in the Seed, and repaired
an ancient one at Ekhmim. These
are perhaps the oldest constructed by
the Arab kings; though Kalkaacndu
pretends that Omar has a prior claim
to this honour.

Close to the Mekkeeas is a powder
magasine, which some years ago acci-
dentally blew up, and nearly destroyed
all that remained of the Nilometer;
in consequence of which an order is
always required for the admission of
avengers. In the same island is the
Men of Ibrahim Pasha, commenced
about twelve years ago by Mr. Trail.
an English gardener and botanist,
sent out to Egypt by the Horti-
cultural Society; and though the
inundationa of 1840 and 1841 de-
stroyed some thousand trees, mostly
of India and other foreign countries,
it is still in a very ﬂourishing con-
ditiou.

Roda was formerly the favourite
resort of the Cairenes, who went to
enjoy the cool shades of this pretty
island; and in 1822 I accompanied
a party to this spot, who seemed to
have very pleasing recollections of
former visits. But the days of simi-
lar ercursions are passed for the
people of Cairo; and present cares
and constant anxiety for the marrow
are now substituted in lieu of occa-
sional relasetion.

It is here that Arab tradition ﬁxes
the ﬁnding of Moses by the daughter
of Pharaoh, whose name, Josephus
tells us, was Thermuthis.

In the time of the latter princes of
the Greek empire, Roda was joined to
the main land by a bridge of boats,
forthe purpose of keeping up a direct
communication between Babvlon and
Memphis, which um existed at the
period of the Arab invasion tinder

Close to Old Cairo stands the
aqueduct, already mentioned. On
returning thence to Cairo, you pass
by the I_(_asr el Ainee. one of the
colleges or schools established by
Mohammed Ali, and the gear or
palace of Ibrahim Pasha; the neigh-
bourhood of which has been greatly
improved within the last ten years. by
the planting of trees, the removal of
mounds of rubbish, and the formation
of roads by which it is approached.

Near Easr el Ainee is the college
of derwishes, mentioned by Pococke.
The derwishes are both the monks
and the freemasons of the East. They
profess great sanctity. and a scru-
pulons observance of religious duties,
but without looking down upon other
religions, or rcviling those who are
of a different creed, in which they may
be said to follow these injunctions of
the l_(oran, “ We have prescri to
