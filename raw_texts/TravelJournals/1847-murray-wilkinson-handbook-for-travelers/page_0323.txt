earliest to the latest periods; the
quarries of Toore-Misarah, and the

Round the corner of the rock out-
side this grotto, lting Remeses 111.,
the fourth successor of Pthahmen, is
represented with the crocodile-headed
god Sarah and Athor, receiving the
honourable distinction of “ president
of the assemblies ;" and at the side are
two large ovals of thesatne Pharaoh.

0n the south side of Wadee e'
Dsyr are vestiges of a small town.
and near it some tombs and quarried
roclts.

A ruined wall of crude brick
ascends the low northern extremity of
the Gebel e' Tayr; and some dis-
tance further up to the east, near the
spot where the mountain road de-
scends into the Wadee e’ Deyr, about
E. S. E. from the convent, is a bed
of trap rock, rarely met with in the
valley of the Nile. The wall appears
again at the ravine called Wadee el
Agéos, four or ﬁve miles further
south, which I shall have occasion to
mention presently.

lnlnnd, on the west bank, nearly
opposite e' Serareeh, and the mouth
of Wadee e' Dayr. is the town of
Samalood, whose name and mounds
proclaim the fortner existence of an
ancient town. and whose lofty mi-
naret is looked upon as a eh]

builder of it is reported to be the
same who made that of Osioot.
