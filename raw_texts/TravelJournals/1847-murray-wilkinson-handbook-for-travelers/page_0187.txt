Hr. Lane has given a full account
ofwhathe does, or pretends todo;

to make on the occasion; which I

r. A belief in the power of
calling up the dead, or exhibiting ap-
of absent persons, has been
long current in the East. The man-
ner of doing this calls to mind the in-
vocation of the Witch of Endor, when
Samuel was made to appear at the
request of Saul ; and the use of ink in
the boy's hand is similar to the oil said
to have been etnployetl for the same
purpose by the Greeks, according to
the Scholiast on Aristophanes.

I now proceed to show as brieﬂy as
possible what are the claims of the mo-
dern magician in rivalling those of old.

On going to see him I was deter-
mined to examine the matter with
minute attention, at the same time
that I divested myself of every pre-
vious hiss, either for or against his
pretended powers. A party having
been made up to witness the exhibi-
tion, we met. according to previom

reement, at Mr. Leuis‘s house on

in, and having taken his place. we all
sat down, some before him. others by
his side. The party consisted of
Colonel Barns-t our consul-general,
Chevalier Krehmer the llussiau con-

Mr. Samuel. Mr. (‘hiistiam M. l'risse,

need of an interpreter.

The magician, after entering into
conversation with many of us on in-
diﬂ'erent subjects. and discussing two
or three pipes, prepared for the per-
formance. He that of all requested
that a brain- of live charcoal might
be brought, and in the mean while
occupied himself in writing upon a
long slip of paper ﬁve sentences of
two lines each, then two others, one of
a single line, and the other of two, as
an invocation to the spirits. Every
sentence began with Tuyurshoon. and
they were very similar to those given
in M r. Lane's book : —

above and below it by a line, to direct
him in tearing them apart.

A boy was then called, who was
ordered to sit down before the magi.
