name of Arcadia. The Theba'ld too waa made into two parta, under the
name of Upper and Lower, the line of separation paaain between Panopolia
and Ptolama'ia-Hermii. The nomea also increaaeg in number, and
amounted to ﬁfty-men. of which the Delta alone contained thirty-four,
nearly ual to those of all Egypt in the time of the Pharaoha.

Amm anua Marcellinna aaya, “ Egypt ia reported to have had three
provincea in former timea, Egypt Proper, the Theba’id, and Libya; to which
posterity added two othera, Auguatamnica, an oﬁiiet from Egypt, and
Pentapolia, aeparated from Libya.”

The northern part of Ethiopia, or of what ia now called Nubia, had the
name of Dodeca-Schanua, or “ 12 achmnea,” and comprehended the
district from Syene to Hieraaycaminon, now Maharraka.

The achmne, according to Strabo, varied in diﬂ‘erent parta of Egypt.
In the Delta it consisted of 80 atadia; between Memphis and the Tbeba'id of
120; and from the Thebald to Byene of 60. The Itinerary of Antoninua
reckona 80 milea or 640 atadia from Syene to Hieraaycaminon ; the achcne
waa therefore (at 8 atadia to a Roman mile) of 5 atadia above Syene.
