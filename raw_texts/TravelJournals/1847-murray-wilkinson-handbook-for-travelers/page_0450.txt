Egyptian mode of drawing them in
squares, when the artists began their
pictutes.

The circumstance of this building
having a double entrance and two
parallel sanctuaries (in which re-
spect, indeed, it is singular among
the existing temﬂes of Egypt), was
owing to the equal honours therein
paid to the two divinities, the god
of the temple itselﬁ and the protect-
ing deity of Ombos; but the appear-
ance of the two winged globes over
the exterior of the portico, instead
of injuring, rather adds to the effect;
nor is the distribution of the parts
of the interior deranged by this un-
usual innovation. The sanctuaries
themselves have been destroyed, and
the position of the back walls can
no longer be traced; but several
small chambers in the front of the
naos still remain, as well as the
greater part of the portico or pro-
naos.

The other ruin, which stands on
an artiﬁcial platform, towering above
the river, appears to have been de-
dicatcd to the crocodile-headed god
Savalt by Ptolemy Physcon; but
the sculptures rather require it to
have been, as M. Champollion sup-
poses, an ediﬁce “ typifying the birth-
place of the young god of the local
triad.” The grand gateway at the
eastern extremity, for it stood at
right angles with the other temple,
bears the name of Auletes, by whom
it was completed. It is, however,
now in so ruinous a state, that little
can be traced of its original plan;
but the pavement is seen in many
places, laid upon stone substructions,
which extend considerably below it;
and some of the walls of the chambers
composing the interior of the uses
are partially preserved. From the
fragments of columns, whose capitals
resembled those of the portico of
Dendera, we are also enabled to
ascertain the site of a grand hall,
that formed part of the building.

were surrounded by a strong crude-
briek enclosure, much of which still
remains: but from its crumblin
materials and the quantity of
that has accumulated within it, the
buildings now appear to stand in
a hollow: though, on examination,
the level of the area is found not to
extend below the base of the wall.

On the eastern face of this en-
closure is a stone teway, dedicated
to Sarah, the Lor of Ombos. which
bears the name of the third Thothmes,
and of Amun-neitgori, who erected
the great obelisks of Kai-nah. This
satisfactorily proves that though the
ruins only date after the accession
of the Ptolemics, or from about the
year so. 173 to 60, there had pre-
viously existed a temple at Ombos,
of the early epoch of the Plies-soils
of the eighteenth dynasty.

The mounds of the town and
remains of houses extend consider-
ably to the east of this enclosure;
and. to judge from their appearance,
Ombos must have suﬂ'ered by ﬁre,
like many other cities of Upper
Egypt-

1 observed several rounded stones
of porphyry, and other primitive
substances scattered in different di-
rections amidst these ruins, which
must have been brought from the
interior of the eastern desert; but
for what purpose, it is diﬂicult to
decide.

At Derdw and a‘. Redesié'h, nearly
opposite Edfoo, are the two principal
shades of the Ahabdeh Arabs, where
they may be engaged for excursions
to Berenice. the emerald mines, and
other places in the desert. _

Soon after passing Edfoo, the valley
of the Nile is conﬁned within very
narrow limits, and though slightly
enlarged in the. vicinity of Ombos,
the mountains again approach the
N ilc a little farther to the south. The
general features of the country begin
to resemble Nubia, and this pecu-
liarity of character is increased by the
