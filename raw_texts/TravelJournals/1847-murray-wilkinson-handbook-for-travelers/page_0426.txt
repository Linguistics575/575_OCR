Passing between two dilapidated

ner, and succeeded by a vestibule, in
front of the granite gateway of the
towers that form the facade of the
court, before the sanctuary.

This sanctuary is of red granite,
divided into two apartments,and sur-
rounded hy numerous chambers of
small dimensions, varying from 29
feet by 16, to 16 feet by 8.

A few polygonal columns of the
early date of Osirtasen I. appear be-
hind the sanctuary, in the midst of
fallen architraves of the same era;
and beyond are two pedestals of red
granite, crossing the line of direction,
in the centre of the open space to the
south-east. They may have supported
obelisks; but they are not square,
like the basements of those monu-
ments, and rather resemble, for this
reason, the pedestals of statues.
Their substructions are of limestone.

After this you come to the co-
lumnar ediﬁce of the third Thothmes.
Its exterior wall is entirely destroyed,
except on the north-east side. Parallel
to the four outer walls is a row of

The total dimensions of this part
of the temple, behind the inner pro-
pyla of the grand hall, are 600 feet,
by about half that in breadth, mak-
ing the total length, from the front
propyla to the extremity of the wall
of circuit, inclusive, 1180 feet. The
additions made at diﬂ'erent periods,
by which the distant portions of this
extensive mass of buildings were
united, will be more readily un-
derstood from an examination of my
Survey, than from any description,
however detailed, I could offer to the
reader. And from this it will appear
that Diodorus is fully justiﬁed in the
following statement: that “the cir-
cuit of the most ancient of the four
temples at Thebes measured 18 sta-
dia," or about ll mile English. The
thickness of the walls, “ of 25 feet,"
owing to the great variety in their
dimensions, is too vague to he no-
ticed ; but the height he gives to the
building, of 45 cubits (67 feet), is
far too little for the grand hall,
which, from the pavement to the
summit of the roof, inclusive, is not
less than 80 feet.
