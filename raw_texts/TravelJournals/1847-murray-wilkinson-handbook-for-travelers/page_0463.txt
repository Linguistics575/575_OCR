for the same distance from Byene to
Hieresycaminon.

Ptolemy omits the names of towns
between Syene end Pselcia. and
merely notices the district itself of
Dodeca-schmnus (“on the east of

Dabod. ——Dabdd, or Dabtidr, is
supposed to be the We of
Antoninus. The ruins there consist
of a temple, founded apparently by
Ashar-Amun, or Atar- 2
Amun, a monarch of —
Ethiopia, who was probe- a
bi y the immediate successor
of Ergemun, the contempo-
rary of Ptolemy Philadel-
phus. (See pp. 2.5. 8:489.)

Over the central pylon.
in frontof it, are the re- ,
mains of a Greek inscrip-
tion, bearing the name
of Ptolemy Philometor,
with that of his queen
Cleopatra. When Mr. Hamilton
visited it, much more remained of
tho inscription than when i saw it;
and restored, it reads as follows:—

The temple was dedicated to Isis,
who, as well as Osiris and her son
I-iorus, were principally worshipped
here; Amun being one of the chief
contemplar deities. Augustus and
Tiberius added most of the sculp.
tures, but they were left unﬁnished,
as was usually the case in the temples
of Nubia. The main building com-
mences with a portico or area. having
four columns in front, connected by
intercolumnar screens; aceutrsl and
two lateral chambers, with a staircase
leading to the upper rooms; to which
succeed another central apartment

two side chambers. On one side of
the portion a wing has been added at
a later period. The three pylons
before the temple follow each other
in succession, but not at equal dis-
tances; and the whole is enclosed
by a wall of circuit. of which the hunt
pylon forms the entrance.

The edytum is unsculptured. but
two monoliths within it bear the
name of Physcon and Cleopatra; and
in the front chamber of the naos is
that of the Ethiopian king “Ashar
(Atat)-Amun, the everlivtng," who
in some of his nomens is called “the
beloved of Isis." Among the few
subjects sculptured in the portion, are
Thoth and Hoe-Hat engaged in
pouring alternate emblems oi lifeend
purity over Tiberius; alluding, I be-
lieve, to the ceremony of anointing
him king. Some distance before the
temple is a stone quay, which had
a staircase leading from the river.

Web," believed by the natives to com-
municate under ground with the
Great Oasis. Two days west of
Dabéd, and about the same distance
from Asouan and from Kalabahee, is
a small uninhabited Oasis, called
Walt Koorloo. it abounds in dates,
and has some wells, but no ruins.

Between Dabéd and Gertassee the
only remains are a wall projecting
into the river, marking perhaps the
site of Tutsi ; a single column; and
on the apposite bank. at Camille, the
ruined wall of a temple. On the
island Mar-96st are some crudebbrick
ruins.

At Gerrossee is an hypcthral court
