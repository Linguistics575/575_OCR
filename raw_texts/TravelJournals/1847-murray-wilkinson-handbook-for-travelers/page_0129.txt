It is to he ed that the pro-
hction of the ' government

hasnotbeee so far extended tothis
bare-ting relic of ancient Alexandria,
as to prevent its pedestal and shaft
being defaced by the names of per-
ms who have visited it, or of ships
ﬁles have anchored in the port, some
of wldch are painted in black letters
of monstrom height.

The name given to this column has
led to much criticism. Some derived
it frosn Pompaios, as having served
for a landmark, and others endea-
voured to read in the inscription the
name of Pompey, instead of Publius.
Others, again, erroneously supposed
in Arabic title, Améod e‘ Sowerf, to
connect it with Severus, and some
even attributed it to Julius Caesar.
But Sari, or Sovari, are terms applied
to any lofty monument, which con-
veys the idea of a "math" and the
inscription, of which Mr. Salt and I
were enabled, with the assistance of a
ladder, and by chalking out the letters,
to make a complete copy, shows it to
have been erected by’Publius, the
prefect of Egypt, in honour of Dio-
cletian.

The total height of the column is
98 feet 9 inches, the shah is 73 feet,
the circumference ‘29 fret 8 inches,
and the diameter at the top of the ca-
pital 16 feet 6 inches. The shaft is
elegant and of good style, but the
capital and pedestal are of inferior
workmanship, and, as has been re-
marked by Dr. Clarke and others,
have the appearance of being of a
diluent epoch. indeed, it is pro-
bable that the shalt is of an earlier

time, and that the unﬁnished capital
and pedestal were added to it, at the
period of its erection in honour of the
emperor.

On the summit I observed a cir-
cular depression of considerable size,
intended to admit the base of a statue,
as is usual on monumental columns;
and at each of the four sides is a
cramp, by which it was secured. This
is more probable than what I before
supposed, that it indicated the posi-
tion of an equestrian statue; and,
indeed, in an old picture or plan of
Alexandria, where some of the ancient
monuments are represented, is the
ﬁgure of a man standing on the
column. An Arab tradition pretends
that it was one of four columns that
once supported a dome or other build-
ing; but little faith is to be placed in
the tales of the modern inhabitants.
Macrisi and Abde’latéef state that it
stood in It stars surrounded by 400
columns, where the library was that
Omer ordered to be burnt; which
(if true) would prove that it belonged
to the Sarnpeum.

That the people of Alexandria
shoulderect a similar monument in
honour of Diocletian is not sun prising,
since he had on more than one occa-
sion a claim to their gratitude, “ having
granted them a public allowance of
corn to the extent of two millions of
tnedimni," and “ after he had taken
the city by siege, when in revolt against
him, having checked the fury of his
soldiers in their promiscuous massacre
of the citisens." To me. indeed, it ap-
pears probable that this column silently
records the capture of Alexandria by
the arms of Diocletian in a. n. 996,
when the rebellion of Achilleus had
obliged him to lay siege to the re-
volted city, and the use of the epithet
utmost, " inrincible." applied to
the emperor, is in favour of my
Opinion. This memorable siege, ac-
cording to the historian of the Decline,
lasted eight months; when, “ wasted
by the sword and by lire, it implored
the clemency of the conqueror, but
