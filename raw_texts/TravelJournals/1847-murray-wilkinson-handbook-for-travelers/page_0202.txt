ate double, to exclude the dust of
Egypt, but without success. Up-
stairs is a boudot'r, which, had the walls
been differently painted, would have
been pretty However, there is
enough in this to show that the two
styles may be combined; for which
the ﬁrst step would be the substitu-
tion of panels in frescoes, used in
some of our modern houses, for the
Greek monstrosities. 'l'he prettiest
part is the colounade, which is lighted
at night by two English chandeliers,
of very elegant shape.

The ride from Cairo to Mataré‘e’h,
near which are the mounds of Heli-
opolis and the obelisk of Osirtasen I.,
occupies shout two hours. A little
beyond the Dimerdash, to the right of
the road, on the edge of the moun-
tains, are the meals and tomb of the
well-known Melek Adel, fcalled el
Adlééh. It is now nearly destroyed,
the‘ dome alone remaining, which is
curious and richly wrought.

The last tomb, after passing the
Dimerdash, has a dome very richly
ornamented inside; and beyond this,
about half-way between the gate
(Bab e' Nusr) and Heliopolis, is the
Igobhet el Ghoree, the tomb of that
lting.

The ride to Matarééh is pretty, and
the latter part is well planted with
trees. In a ﬁeld to the left of the
road, a little before reaching Ma-
tarééh, are some very large blocks,
which some suppose to be capitals of
columns.

Heliopolis is a little beyond that
village. It is sufﬁciently known from
adistance by its obelisk. Tradition
speaks of another, which fonmeriy
stood opposite this, and which was
doubtless of the same Pharaoh; and
we may readily credit it, as it was cus-
‘tomary for the Egyptians to place
them in pairs at the entrance of their
temples. Before them appears to

have been an avenue of sphinses,
which probably extended to the north-
west gate of the city, fragments of
which may still be seen near the
site of that entrance. Pococke men-
tions, near the same spot, a sphinx of
ﬁne yellow mstble, 92 feet long; “a
piece of the same kind of stone with
hieroglyphics; and, 16 paces more to
the north, several blocks," having the
appearance of sphinxes ; as well as an-
other stone with hieroglyphics on one
side. According to Strabo, it was by
one of these avenues that you ap-
proached the temple of the sun of
Heliopolis, which he describes as laid
outin the ancient Egyptian style, with
a dromos of sphinxes before it, form-
ing the approach to the vestibule.
And this being the that time I have
had occasion to notice an Egyptian
temple, I cannot do better than in-
troduce his description of the general
plan of those buildings, which is less
out of place here, as he has given it
in connection with Heliopolis.

“ At the entrance is a pavement,
one plethrum (100 feet) or some
what less in breadth, and three or four,
or even more, in length, which is
called the dromos (course) ; and this,
according, to Callimschus, is sacred
to Anubis. Throughout its whole
length ate placed on either side stone
sphinxes, distant from each other 20
cubits, (30 feet), or a little more ; so
that one set of them is on the right,
the other on the left (as you pass up
the dromos to the temple). After
the sphinxes, is a large propylon ; and
when you have paoceeded further in,
another propylon, and then a third ;
but neither to the propyla nor the
sphinxes is there any ﬁxed number,
these varying in different temples, as
well as the length and breadth of
the dromos. After the propyla is
the temple, having a large handsome
portico (pronsos, spovoos) and an
odytum (sékos, onset), in propontion
without any statue, or. at least not
in the foam of a man, but of some
animal." Nest follows a not very
