Plin says my sup t o
tomb oyf Amasis; a tradititn which
arose, no doubt, from the resemblance
of the name of the king, by whose
order the rock was cut into this form,
Thothmes or Thothmosis. to that of
the Salte Pharaoh. The oral of the
fourth Thothmes occurs in the hiero-
glyphic inscription on its breast;
but from the known architectural
whims of the third of that name, it
is not improbable that he was the
ori 'nator of this singular monument,
an that Thothmes IV. may have
added this inscription, as ltemeaes
II. did those of the aide tablets.
The mistake of assigning the sphins
to Amasis ma also be accounted
for by the simp e fact that the Greeks
and Romans were better acquainted
with his name than that of the earlier
Pharaohs; and Lucan has - gone
further, and given to Antasis the
pyramids themselves. in another
place, he even buries the l’tolemles
in those monuments. Lucan, how-
ever, was not famous either for accu-
racy or poetical comtiosition ; though
we may indulgently forgive any fancy
of the ancients, when one modern
writer buries the patriarch Joseph in
the great pyramid. and others con-
found the son of Jacob with Sarapis,
or condemn him to be worshipped by
the Egyptians, under the form of
Apia.

The cap of the aphins, probably the

but a cavity in the head attests its
position, and explains the method by
which it was ﬁled. The mutilated
state of the face. and the absence of
the none, have led many to the erro-
neous conclusion that the features
were African; but. by tahin an
accurate sketch of the face, and re.
