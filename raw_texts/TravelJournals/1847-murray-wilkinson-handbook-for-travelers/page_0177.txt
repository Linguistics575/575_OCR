Within this khan is a square oc-
cupied by dealers in copper, and some
other commodities; and in a part
called “ within the chains,” are silks
and other Constantinople goods;
these. as well as most of the other
shops, being kept by Turks. There
are also some Greeks, who are princi-
pally tailors. The shape are open in
front. and might be mistaken for cup-
boards.

The Khan Khaléel, (or Khan Kha-
leelee) was built in 691 a. tt. (a.n.
1299) by one of the oﬂicers of the
reigning Sultan, whose name, Khaléel,
it bears. This man, under the pre-
tence of removing the bones of the
Caliphs to a more suitable place of
interment, is said to have thrown them
carelessly on the mounds of rubbish
outside the walls; to which profane
conduct they ascribe his miserable
end; having been killed in battle in
Syria, and his body having been eaten
by dogs. This, like many other Arab
stories, may be doubted.

The Hamaéwee is a sort of Mots
or child, where crepe, silks, cloth,
and other goods, mostly of European
manufacture, are sold. The dealers
are all Christians, and it is therefore
closed on a Sunday.

In the Terbéei, which is between
the Hamzowee and the Ghore'e'h, otto
of rose and various perfumes, silk
thread. and a few other things are
sold; and near this is the Fahatnin,
the abode of the Moghrebins, or
Moon, who sell blankets, Pea caps
(toroidal), bornOOses(boreaees). and
other articles from the Barbary coast.

After passing the Ghoré'e'h and the
Fahamin (going towards the Bah
Zoodyleh. is the Akkndeen, where silk
cord and gold lace are bought ; behind
which is the market of the Moaiud,
where cotton, wools, cushions, and
beds of a common kind. woollen
shawls, and other coarse stuffs worn
by the lower orders, are sold daily,
both in the shops and by auction.

other names, indicates the goods sold
there. -

dé'ét, at what is called the Soog e'
Zuilut,) where fowls, pigeons, rags,
