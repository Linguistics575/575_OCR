are between twenty and thirty lines
of hieroglyphies much defaced; and
near it an two headless statues sup-
porting a sort of tablet, with three
daughters of the king on the side in
intaglio. Beyond are two other
statues, and at the side of this, as of
the other group, are two small muti-
lated ﬁgures.

Several years ago a peasant dis-
covered a large sum of money buried
in the ground near this spot, which
had been concealed there by one of
the Memloeks, in their retreat,
after being defeated by Mohammed
Ali, the year before the massacre in
the citadel. M. Linant had been
told of it some years before, by a
person who was present on the ocea-
sion, who even described the spot,
and the stone that covered it, the
accidental removal of which led to
the discovery. Treating it, however,
as one of the many idle tales told in
Egypt, he thought no more about
the matter, until the good fortune of
the peasant recalled it to his recollec-
tion. The discovery was the talk of
the whole neighbourhood when I
visited Toona, and conﬁrmed the
popular belief in the existence of the
lens, or “ treasures,” supposed to be
buried near ancient ruins. But the
good fortune of the finder was soon
converted into a misfortune. The
Turkish governor of the district
arrested him, took from him all he
had found, and bastinadoed him,
(their usual custom.) to make him
confess if any portion had been con.
cealed. Such is the Turkish mode
of claiming the rights of a lord of
the manor.

Dareot-Oshrnoon. or, as it is some-
times called, Dareot e' Nakhl (“ o!

of old towns, but no remains in

and position I conjecture that it oc-
cupies the site of the Hermopolitana

higher up the river, on the opposite
bank, at the projecting corner of the
eastern mountains, is a place called
lsbdyda, or Sebdyda, behind and to
the N. E. of which are several grot-
toes and modern quarries. Some
have the usual agricultural and other
scenes, and the various subjects com-
mon to tombs. in two of them is
the name of Pepi in a square, and
another has these two ovals together,
each followed by the word “ priest."
