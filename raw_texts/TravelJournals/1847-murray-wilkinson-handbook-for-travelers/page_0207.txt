The same species of rock rises here
and there to the southward, upon the
slope of the limestone range, and the
bed above it contains petriﬁed wood
of various kinds.

The principal mess of this, mis-
called the “forest,” may be seen four
miles to the S. S. E. of the Red
Mountain; where, besides thorn-
bearin trees and palms, are some
join stems resembling bamboos,
one of which Is about ﬁfteen feet long,
broken at each of the knots.

Other specimens of palms are met
with on the Sues road ; and the same
kindsof agatized wood occur again
inland on the other side of the Nile,
on the borders of “'ady Fargh, evi-
dently once imbedded in a similar
stratum.

The Mokuttum range is of mag-
nesien limestone, like the greater part
of the mountains on the eastern side
of the valley of the hill. That part
behind the citadel has also obtained
the name of Gebel e’ Juoshee, from
the tomb of a shelth buried there.

Among other fossils in this moun-
tain, I found the crab, echini, &c.,
and shark's teeth in the lower rocks,
immediately behind the citadel. In a
ravine to the right of the road to the
5266“! wood is a spring of water,

ing from the mountain; and the
spot, for Egypt, is romantic.

A ride of about 4 miles from Cairo,
through a shady srenue of trees, takes
you to Mohammed Ali's palace and
prdens of Shoohrs, to the north of
the city, on the banks of the Nile.
This avenue, which has been planted
about 30 years, is formed almost
entirely of the Acacia Lebbekh;
which last has not only the recom-
mendation of rapid growth, but of

distance to the left, having forsaken
its ancient channel, which may still
be traced between the road and the
bank, and which in early times ran
through the plain that now separates
Cairo from Boolsk. Before reaching
the palace, you pass the village of

or it is called, Shoobra
el Makkiseh,M to distinguish it from
another place, 14 miles lower down
the river, Shoobra e' ShabeSh, where
the direct road to Alexandria crosses
the Damietta branch.

'lhe gardens of Shoobra, though
formal, are pretty; and the scent of
roses, with the gay appearance of
ﬂowers, is an agreeable novelty in
Egypt. The walks radiate from
centres to different parts of the garb
dens, some covered with trelliswork,
most comfortable in hot weather.
They are carefully kept by natives
under the direction of Greek garden-
ers; but a great mistake has been
made in cutting down the trees behind
the great fountain-kiosk, which tended
so much to keep it cool, and to mask
the ugly gas-house that supplies its
lamps.

There is no great variety of ﬂow-
ers; roses, geraniums,and a few other
kinds are the most abundant. In one
place 1 observed some soar trees (Aca-
cia Nilotica), of unusual height, not
less than 40 or 45 feet hogh.

with an immense marble basin con-
tainlng water, about 4 feet deep, sur-
rounded by marble balustradea. These
as well as the columns and mouldings,
are from Camra, the work ofItaliana,
who have indulged their fancies by
carving fish and various strange things
among the ornamental details. You
walk round it under a covered corri-
dor, with kiosks projecting into the
water; and at each of the four cor»
ners of the building is a room with
diwans, fitted up partly in the Turk-

ish, partly in the European style.
