The traveller should have the deck 1

of his boat washed every morning;
and he may select any one of the
crew who appears most willing for
iris duty. When one is chosen, it is
more likely to be done. An allow-
ance of a piastre or two a week
should be given for this extra labour,
and care should be taken that it is
never omitted: unless done always,
it will cease to be done with good
will. Above all things, I recom-
mend strict discipline in the boat, and
invariable obedience to orders, what-
ever they may be, with the full un-
derstanding of course that they
are reasonable and just. But I am
far from advising that constant use
of the stick which is sometimes re-
sorted to most unnecessarily: ﬁrm-
ness and the determination of being
obeyed seldom fails to command
respect and obedience; for, when
they know you will be obeyed, they
will seldom disregard an order.
When once that obedience is estab-
lished. then you may be as indulgent
as you like, and every good oﬁce,
‘every reward, will be received as a
favour. Without it, kindness will
be construed into fear or ignorance;
every attempt will be made to deceive
the too easy traveller; and in order to
have a moment’s peace, he will be
obliged to have recourse to the very
means he had been hoping to avoid;
by applying to some Turkish gover.
nor, or by substituting for kindness
too late severity, either of which will
only draw upon him hatred and con-
tempt.

One thing, however, I must say, is,
that however much they may try to
impose on one, over whom they think
to get the upper hand, they never har-
bour any feelings of revenge. They
are like the frogs in the fable with the
log of wood. In short, my advice is,
to be strict and just, without unneces-
sary violence, in order to have the
satisfaction of being indulgent.

thing else you may require, and they
may occasionally receive a few piastres
to buy tobacco. It is better‘not to
give it each time, but after having
been so employed on several occasions;
the promise of it being held out, pro-
vided they are always found ready to
go; and if there is any rivalry among
the others, they also should be allow-
ed to take their turns in this employ-
ment. When properly managed, no
peeple are so willing or good-natured;
when not understood, none so trou-
blesome.

I have already stated that when the
crew behave well, they may have a
sheep given them at some of the large
towns, or a certain quantity of meat at
least, as a reward for past exertions ,-
and at the end of the journey they
and the ré'is will expect a present in
money, according to their behaviour
during the voyage. Any man who
has done extra work should be paid
more ; and the bachhirh of the crew
should be given to one of them, and
not to the ré'is, as he would probably
cheat them of a great portion; for
few in Egypt, whether Turks or
natives, part with money without an
effort to defraud.

In leaving Boolak either for Upper
Egypt or the North, as well as in ar-
riving there, the traveller should re-
sist any demand for backshish (a word
that haunts him in Egypt), which the
custom-house cawdsses will of course
ask for; they have nothing whatever
to do with him or his baggage, and
have therefore no claim, on the score
of allowing to pass free what they
dare not touch. Any attempt to
stop his things should be repre-
sented, and care should be_ taken
that the offender is punished, in order
to put a stop to this nuisance.
