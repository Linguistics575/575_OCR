tombs; and the fact of the roads
leading directly up the hill from the
bank to their entrances favours this
opinion. 0n the other hand, the
principal person buried there is called
“ Governor of the eastern district; ”
and his place of abode would naturally
be on that side of the Nile. This
would argue that the town also stood
there; and if so, it could only have
been on the spot between Beni Has-
san and the modern western channel
of the Nile, and has been canied
away during the encroachments made
by the river in its shifting course.
Many changes have indeed taken
place, both here, and on the west side,
about Sagheeat Moose, within the
memory of man.

This is the most northerly
point where crocodiles are found;
and as early as the end of March
I saw them basking on the sand-
banlts, while rowing from Karm
Aboo Omar to Beni Hassan. 0n
inquiry, I found that they have for
years frequented this spot, and that I
was wrong, in common with other
travellers, in limiting their range to
the neighbourhood of :Munfaloot.

The villages of Beni Hassan were
destroyed about 95 years ago by
Ibrahim Pasha, the inhabitants
being incorrigible thieves; and even
now it is as well to keep a good
watch at night, while anchored near
this spot. Indeed the inhabitants of
all the villages, from Beni Hassau t0
the vicinity of Manfaloot, are ad-
dicted to thieving, and additional pre-
cautions are necessary throughout the
whole of that district. The present
village of Beni Hassan stands two
miles to the south of the grottoes;
and nearly one mile to the S. E. of
it is the Speos Artcmidos, to which
the common name of Stabl Antar has
been applied by the modern Egyp-
tians. It is situated in a small rocky
valley, 0r ravine, about a quarter of a
mile from its mouth.

To the right, on entering the
ravine, are several pits and tombs cut
in the rock. Some of these last have

had well-shaped doorways with the
usual Egyptian cornice, and round
one are still some traces of coloured
hieroglyphics. Three are larger than
the rest. In the ﬁrst of these (going
from the valley of the Nile}, the
paintings have been blackened with
smoke, and few of them can be dis-
tinctly traced. Near its 8. E. corner
are some water plants, and here
and there some Greek inscriptions
scratched on the stucco. Beyond
this, to the E., is another with a cor-
nice over the door, bearing the names
of Alexander, the son of Alexander
the Great, Ptolemy Legus being at
that time governor of Egypt in his
name. In the centre are the globe
and ssps, and on the architrave below
the king is kneeling to present the
ﬁgure of Truth to the lioness-headed
goddess of the place, Pasht or Bu-
bastis. Behind him stands Athor,
the Egyptian Venus. On one side
of the two centre compartments the
king is standing in the presence of
Amun and Horns, on the other of
Thoth and A0 (Gem, or Her-
cules).

midos (“the care of Diana”) itself.
Like the others, it is wholly excavated
in the rock. It was begun by Thoth-
mes 111., and other sculptures were
added by Osirei, the father of Re-
meses the Great; but it was never
completed. It consists of a portico
with two tows of square pillars, four
in each, of which the outer one alone
remains; and though rough on one
side and unﬁnished, they each bear
the name of those two kings, and of
the goddess Pasht, the Egyptian
Diana, whose legend is followed by
a lioness (not a cat), as throughout
the sculptures of this grotto. A door,
or passage, leads thence into the naos,
which measures 8* by 9 paces. and
at the end wall is a niche about 6 feet
deep, and raised 8 feet from the ﬂoor,
intended no doubt for the statue of
the goddess, or of the sacred animal
dedicated to her. It is also un-
