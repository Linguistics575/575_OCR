the palace of Ahmed Pasha Taber,

behind the Usbel_t_é'e’h (to the S. E.)

frequented by English, and reason-
le.

The Giardino, or French hotel,
kept by Doumergue, in the French
Street, is cheap, but it has no very
good rooms. The charges are 30
piastres a day, including a room,
breakfast, lunch at noon, and dinner
at the table d’ltdte in the evening, with
via ordinat're, other wines bein
charged according to the carts. t
is mostly patronised by French and
Italians. In former times it was the
only hotel that travellers frequented ;
with the exception of an indiﬂerent
one (no longer existing) in the same
street; and some took up their abode
at the Latin convent.

There is a material opposite the
main guard, in the principal street of
the Frank quarter, or Moshe, kept
by Pietro Chiesa, which is frequented
by Italians and others. It is reputed
by them not bad, and of course mo-
derate. There is also an hotel in the
same street, kept by Guerra, bttt not
ﬁtst-rate, and, I have no doubt, seldom
visited by English travellers. The
mat are not worthy of notice.

Four houses of the late Osman
Eﬁ'endi in the Soog e’ Zullut, are also
let furnished, and one ﬂoor or set of
rooms may be had at from 5 to 8
piastrcs a day, or by the month at
about 150 piastres. It consists of a
bed-room, sitting-room, and kitchen ;
the Malt, or entrance court below,
being common to all who live in the
house. The largest has only two
ﬂoors.

b. Houses as: came.

House rent in the Turkish quarter
varies from about 30 to 120 piastres
a month. Some small houses in out-
of-the-way places let even at )0 or
15, and some large ones at 200.
The average rent of good houses
there may be rated at from 50to 100,
and the latter may he considered,
generally speaking, a full price; un-
