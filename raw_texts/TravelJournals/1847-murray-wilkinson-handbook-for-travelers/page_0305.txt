" the mo-

nastery of St. Antony.” is inhabited .

 

a hermit who founded another mo-
nastery, called alter him Dayr Bdlos,
distant by the road about fourteen
miles to the south-east. Dayr An-
tonios is seventeen or eighteen, and
Dayr Bolas nine miles from the sea.
The former may be considered the
principal monastery in Egypt; and
its importance is much increased since
the election of the patriarch has
been transferred to it from those at
the Natron lakes. Dayr Bolas, how-
ever, claims for itself an equal rank;
and one of the patriarchs has been
chosen from its members; though
Dayr Antonius surpasses it in the
number of its inmates. I tried in
vain to learn something about the
dictionary for Coptic and Arabic,
said by Wansieb to be in the library
there, which he says was written by
Ebn el Assal, and valued at thirty
crowns. Nor were my questions re-
specting the Coptic map of the petri-
arch, containing the names and posi-
tion of the towns in Egypt, more
successful. Both eonvents have gar-
dens. Those of Dayr Antonios are
kept in very good order, and are
an agreeable retreat after crossing the
desert. The monks are hospitable,
and the convent is famed for its
olives. They show the cavern where
their founder lived in the rocks above;
but there is nothing remarkable in
the convent beyond its antiquity and
associations.

Both convents have been deonyed
and rebuilt. That of St. Antony
stands below the Eslslla mountains, a
limestone range of considerable height,
which bounds the Wadee el Arrahe
to the south. This valley has re-
ceived its name from the pleural, or
