stones that stand towards the southern
extremity of this cemetery, are Cuﬁc
inscriptions.

The epitaphs are of the earlier in-
habitantsof Asouan, and bear different
dates, from about the commencement
of the third to that of the ﬁlteenth
century of the Hégira. They begin
— “ In the name of God, the element
and merciful,” and mention the name
and parentage of the deceased, who
is said to have died in the true faith ;
saying. “ I bear witness that there is
no deity but God alone; he has no
partner; and that Mohammed is the
servant and apostle of God.” Some
end with the date, but in others, par-
ticularly those of the earliest epochs,
it occurs about the centre of the in-
scription.

This is supposed to be the place of
Martyrs mentioned by Aboolfeda, and
often confounded with that of Es’né.

The mask of Amer here, as at
Fostat (old Cairo). presents merely
round arches, in imitation of the Greek
or Roman style of building, in vogue
at the period of the Arab invasion;
but it is not altogether improbable,
that an attentive examination of the
ancient Saracenic remains around this
cemetery might lead to the discovery
of some early specimens of the pointed
arch. -

A short distance from the cemetery
of Asouan is a small bank of that
diluvial deposit so frequently seen on
the road to Philm, which is worthy
of the notice of the geologist from its
abounding in shells, and from its
having several blocks of granite lying
upon its upper surface.

The position of that cluster of rocks
through which the road leads to
Philte, and in which the principal
granite quarries are situated, bounded
on the west by the cataracts, on the
east by an open space separating them
from the range of mountains on that
side, on the south by the channel of
Phile, and on the north by the town
of Asouan itself, no doubt gave rise
to the following passage of Pliny,

some 29. -— manna 'ro moms.

which at ﬁrst sight appears so sin-
gular; “ Syene, its vocatnr pais-
sala;" since we ﬁnd that ancient
authors frequently used the terms
peninsula and insula in the same
sense as our aord isolated, which may
be justly applied to the rocks of
Syene.

The most interesting objects in the
neighbourhood of Asouan are the
granite quarries; and in one, that lies
towards the south-east of the Arab
cemetery, is an obelisk, which, having
been broken before it was entirely
detached from the rock, was leﬁ in the
quarry. An inclined road leads to
the summit of the hill to the south-
east, and on the descent at the other
side, was a fallen pillar (lately taken
away) with a Latin inscription, stating
that “ new quarries had been dis-
covered in the vicinity of Philc; that
many large pilasters and columns had
been hewn from them, during the
reigns of Severus and ° Antoninus
(Caracalla), and his mother Julia
Domna;" and that “ this hill was
under the tutelary protection of Ju-
piter-Hammon- Cennbis (or Kneph ),
and J nno” (or Sate), the deities of
Elephantine.

Between this and the river is a large
sarcophagus, which having been
broken, was left in the quarry.

Besides these, several of the rocks
about Asouan bear the evident appear-
ance of having been quarried; and
the marks of wedges, and the numer-
ous tablets about this town, Elephan-
tine, Phihe, and Big eh, announce
the removal of the b oaks, and the
reign of the Pharaoh by whose orders
they were hewn. Many of them are
of a date previous to and after the
accession of the eighteenth dynasty.
while others bear the names of later
monarchs of the twenty-sixth, imme-
diately before the invasion of Cam-
byses; but some merely record the
victories of those kings over the ene-
mies of Egypt, or the exvotos of pious
visiters.

It is curious to observe in these
