but little now remains, except the
imperfect traces of chariots and
horses, and some confused ﬁgures.
0n the wall of the temple the king
is represented. in the presence of
Amunre, sla ing the prisoners he
has taken, and7 accompanied by a lion.
This calls to mind the account given
by Diodorus, of Osymandyas being
followed to war by that animal; and
on the opposite side, the lion seises
one of the falling captives. as he is
held by the victorious monarch.

Re was the chief deity of the sanc-
tuary, from whom the ancient town
received the name of Ei-lte, “the
abode of the sun;" and we ﬁnd
that this “ temple of Remeses” was
also considered under the special pro-
tection of Amunre and of Thoth.
Pthah likewise held a distinguished
place among the contemplar gods;
and this custom of introducing the
divinities of the neiglirouring towns
was common both in Egypt and
Nubia.

The temple is cut in the rock; but
is of no great else, the total depth
being only about 110 feet. Nor are
thesculptures of the interior worthy
of theers ol'the Great Rm—
a remark which equally applies to
those of Sabooa and Gerf Hossayn.
At the upper end of the sanctuary
is a niche containing four sitting
ﬁgures.

desert. cut in a rock of pyramidal
form, which bears the name of Re-

The person of the tomb was one
