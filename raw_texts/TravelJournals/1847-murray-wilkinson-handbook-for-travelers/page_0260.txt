city, and “strongly fortiﬁed,” as its
Hebrew and Arabic names imply, is
now a small open town, containing
about 4000 inhabitants. It per-
formed a distinguished part in the
early history of Palestine, and is often
mentioned in the Bible; but it was
destroyed on the conquest of Syria by
the Moslems, and has never since re-
covered its impertance as a city.

The point of the Delta was for-
merly a little below the palace of
Shoobra, where the Pelusiac branch
turned off to the N. N. E. towards
Bubastis. It is now at the junction
of the Rosetta and Damietta branches.
These two, the ancient Bolbitine and
Bucolic (or Phatmetic) branches, are
said by Herodotus to have been
“ made by the hand of man," and
are the only two remaining, the
others having either entirely disap-
peared, or being dry in summer;
which would seem to explain an ap-
parently unintelligible prophecy of
Isaiah. that man should go over the
Nile “ dry shod." (Isaiah xi. l5.)

Bershoma is famous for its ﬁgs;
and a little beyond, on the opposite
bank, inland in the Delta, is Pha-
rsoone'éh, from which the canal of

canal began about four miles W
north,closetothevillageo(Bsen-
shems, and passing by Menoof, fell
into the Rosetta branch at Nader.
About thirty years ago it was found
necessary to close its eastern en-
trance, in consequence of its carrying
08' the water into the Rosetta branch;
and other navigable canals have been
used for communication with the inte-
rior. Four or ﬁve miles lower down is
the canal of Karinayn, another noble
work. At e’ Jéﬂ'aré'éh it Rpm-am

W. to Tanta, and the other b Map

eaten at the old Sebennytic mouth,
and the Pineptimi ostium, one of the
false mouths of the Nile. The
western channel that goes to Tanta
is only navigable for small craft after
January; but the other is sufficiently
deep to admit boats of 200 ardeha
burthen the whole year. It is, how.
ever, closed by a bridge and sluices
at Santah, below e’ Jaﬂ‘aréiih; and
here goods are transferred to smaller
boats for Nabaro, and those places
with which the communication is
kept up by other channels. This is
the general principle of all the large
canals of the Delta, and has been
adOpted in that of Mo'és, and some-
times in that of Alexandria.
Brahma-Asset, “ Benba of honey,”
is the successor of Athribis, whose
mounds are seen to the north. The
still hear the name of Atreéb. The
town appears to have been of con-
siderable extent. nearly a mile in
length, E. and W., and three quarters
of a mile N. and S. It was inter-
sected by two main streets crossing
each other nearly at right angles;
and there was probably a square at
the spot where they met. A little
beyond this quadrim’um, or crossway,
to the W., is another open space,
apparently the site of the principal
temple, and traces may perhaps be
discovered of the sacred enclosure on
