no let Cataract. -- The cataract,
which is called by the natives
E’Shellal. is merely a rapid, whose
falls do not exceed live or six feet,
and is passable at all times of the
year. The hosts are towed up by
ropes; and now that the passagehas
been widened. and the people have
had so much experience, there is little
fearof accidents. In going up, boats
pass to the east of the island of Big-
geh, and in descending to the west of
it. The general fall of the Nile
through Egypt, below the cataracts,
is shout ﬁve inches to a mtle, which

Island of Wh—Pkt'la. known in
Arabic by the name of Atlas cl Wo-
godd, stands a short distance above
the cataract. about 7 miles from
Asouan. and is no less interesting
from the subjects contained in its as-
cred buildings than for the general
effect of the ruins; which. with the
scenery of the adjoining island, and.
the wild rocks on the opposite shore,
have deservedly obtained the epithet
“ beautiful.“ In Greek it was called
Omahand in Egyptian Pilsk,or Ailak,
and Ma-n‘-Ialt, “ the place of the fron-
tier.” Philoe is a mimomer.

The principal buildin is the tem-

completed by succeeding monarchs;
among whom are Energetcs 1.. Phi-
lometor. his brother Eucrgetes IL,
with the two Cleopatras. and Ptolemy
the elder son of Auletes, whose name
is found in the area and on the towers
ofthe propylon. Many ofthe sculp-
tures on the exterior are of the later
epoch of the Roman emperors, among
whom I observed Augustus. Tiberius.
Claudius, Domitian, Nerve. and
Trajan.

Many parts of 4his building, parti-

Phareonie monuments. are remarkable
for lightness and elegance: and from
the state of their preservation. they

architecture. Nor are the sculptures
devoid of interest; and those of the
chamber nearly over the western
adytum, containing the death and
resurrection of Osiris. as well as of
the peripteral temple on the left en-
tering the area, relating to the birth
of Horus, throw great light on the
study of Egyptian mythology. This
youthful deity, with his parents. Isis
and Osiris, constituted the triad wor-

distribution of the many parts of the
great temple. I ought not to omit
the small dark rooms in the wall of
the eastern sdytntn. to which a stair-
case leads from near the front of that
chamber. They have the appearance
of being intended either for conced-
ing the sacred treasures of the temple.
or for some artifice connected with
superstition. and perhaps with the
punishment of those who oﬂhnded
the majesty of the priesthood.
