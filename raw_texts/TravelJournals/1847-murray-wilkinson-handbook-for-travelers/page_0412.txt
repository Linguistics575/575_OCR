The smallest, which are the. be-

tomb itself, which consists of a long

crude-brick pyramids at the western I hall, supported by a double row of

extremity of Dlll‘l Abno Negga, in-
creased the number of the larger se-
pulchres. Others bear the name of
Pthahmen, his son and successor; in
one of which, having an outersrea,
enclosed by a stone wall, colossal
ﬁgures of the lord and lady of the
tomb are majestically seated in the
ﬁrst chamber. But the most inte-
resting objects on this part of the hill
are the crude—brick pyramids them-
selves, as well from the state of their
preservation, as from the existence of
the arches which form the roofs of
their central chambers; nor,judging
from the style of the frescoes, can we
venture to assign to them a date pos-
terior to the third Remeses, or about
a. c. 1230.

From the above statement alone it
is evident that these districts cannot
be classed under particular reigns;
but with regard to the exclusive ap-
propriation of certain pants of the
Tbeban cemetery to peculiar castes, it
may be observed that in those places
where the com net nature of the rock
was best suite for large excavations,

 

four pillars, and another of smaller
dimensions beyond it, with four
pillars in the centre. Tbel
of them, and indeed of all then-pul-
chres of Thebes, are those in the
Assaseef, one of which (R. in the
Survey) far exceeds in extent any one
of the tombs of the kings. lts outer
court or area, is 103 feet by 76, with
a ﬂight of steps descending to its
centre from the entrance, which lies
between two massive crude-brick
walls, once supporting an arched
gateway. The inner door, cut like
the rest of the tomb in the limestone
rock, leads to a second court, 53 feet
by 67, with a peristyle of pillars on
either side, behind which are two
closed corridors. That on the west
containsa pit and one small square
room. and the opposite one has a si-
milar chamber, which leads to a nar-
row passage, once closed in two
places by masonry, and evidently
used for a sepulchral purpose.
Continuing through the second
area, you arrive at a porch, whose
arched summit, hollowed out of the
