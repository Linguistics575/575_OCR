hcture, hearing the name of the
sultan, are suspended from the side
walls. Behind, and forming the same
part of building, is the tomb, which
hearsthedateof 764 oftbe Hegira
a. n. 1368), two years later than his
which happened in the month
of Jumad al owel, a. n. 769. it is
surmounted by a large dome, like
many Others, of wood and plaster, on
a basement and walls of stone, and
the ornamental details are of the some
materials. On the tomb itself is a
large copy of the goran, written in
beautiful distinct characters, and over
it are suspended three of the coloured
lamps.

The blocks used in the erection of
this noble ediﬁce were brought from
the pyramids; and thou h we regret
that one monument shou d have been
defaced in order to supply materials
for another, we must confess, that few
buildings could summon to their aid
greater beauty to plead an excuse,
while we regret that it is not likely
to be as durable as those ancient
structures. The mask of El Ghoree,
the Morastdn, the citadel, and other
buildings, were indebted for stone to
the same monuments, which were to
them the same convenient quarry, as
the Colin to the palaces at llome.

The mask of Sultan 5.1.061: is
near the basaar of the Khan Khaleel,
and is better known from being at-
tached to the Morostén or madhouse,
founded by that philanthmpic prince
in a.n. 681, or 1287 a. n. In the
Morostin itself is another mosk buolt
by the same king, whose name is
found at the E. end, “tnowlina oo
seedna e' Solgdn el Melek el Mnnaoor
Ssyf e' dooneea on e' deen Kalaoon
e’ Sdlehee," in an inscription of four
lines, with the date of “684 a. II., in
the month of Jumad el owel;” and
over the door of the main entrance
of the building, another inscription
says the whole was begun in the
month of [1th el akher 683, and
ﬁnished in Jumad el owel 684 ; being

king oil'ered a large reward to the ar-
chitect and builders if ﬁnished within
the year. This, however, they failed
in doing; but it was completed in the
short space of time mentioned in the
inscription, only one month over the
period prescribed; which fully refutes
the notion that Sultan _i_(_sla06n only
laid the foundations, and that the
Morostdn was ﬁnished by his son
N‘ser Mohammed.

The ﬁrst morostln in Egypt is
said to have been built by Abool-
gnysh Khamaraweeh, the son and
successor of Ahmed ebn e' Tooloon,
about the year 890 a. n.; or, accord-
ing to some, by Ahmed ebn e‘ Too-
loon himself. The following story
is related as the cause of its funn-
dation. A lady of distinction harin
become obnoxious to her husbanf,
was put away on the plea of insanity,
and given in charge to persons who
took care of mad peOpIc; but having
escaped from her place of conﬁne-
ment, at the moment the king hap-
pened to be passing by, she threw
herself at his feet, and implored his
protection. The injustice of her de-
tention. and the many cases of mis-
management detected on this occasion.
determined the king to found a public
institution, where similar practices
could not take place; and be there-
fore made two morostdns or mad-
houscs, one near the hippodrome or
Karaomedin (where this scene took
place), the other between the Kalat
el Kebsh and the island of Booldh.
Little less than 400 years alter, was
founded the present Morostln, the
only one now existing in Egypt,
which. though conducted in a dis-
graceful manner in late times, speaks
highly for the humane intentions of
its founder.

By his orders, the patients, what-
ever might be the nature of their
complaints, were regularly attended
by medical men, and nurses attached
to the establishment; and their minds
were reliesed by the introduction of
a hand of music, which played at in-
