Thebes.

In No. 99. are some very richly-
ooloured vases of not inelegent form.

No. 81. presents some curious sub-
jects, among which are offerings of
gold ri s, eggs, apes, leopards, ivory,
ebony. ins, and e cemeleoperd, with
several other interesting frescoes, un—
fortunately much destroyed. Over
the eggs is the word sooeht', in the
hieroglyphios, signifying “ eggs.”
The names of the Pharaohs here are
Thothmes I. and III. In the inner
room is a chase, and the chetiot of
the chesseur, partially preserved.

In No. 33. the chief object worthy
of notice is the ﬁgure of a queen, wife
of 'Ihothmes III. and mother of
Amunoph IL, holding her young
son in her lap, who tramle beneath
his feet nine captives of nations he
afterwards subdued.

Before the canopy. under which
they are seated, ate a fen-bearer, some
female attendants, and e minstrel, who
recites to the sound of a guitar the
praises of the young king.

On the corresponding well is a
collection of furniture and orna-
mental objects, with the figures of
Amun0ph IL, his mother, and
Thothmes I.

On the opposite well, an offering
of ducks and other subjects are deserv-
ing of notice.

No. 34. has the name of the same
Amuttoph, and of Tbothmes I., his
immediate predecessor. It contains
e curious design of a garden and
vineyard, with other subjects.

though much ruined, oﬂ'ers some es-
cellent drawing, particularly in some
dancing ﬁgures to the left (entering ),
whose graceful attitudes remind us
rather of the Greek than the Egyp-
tian school ; and indeed were we not

assured by the name of Amunoph II. 3 Tholhmes III.

A VERY INTERESTING TOUR.

lmqees end other devices. Indeed
ell these forms of vases, the so-celled
Me botder, end many of the
painted ornaments which exist on
Greek remains, are found on Egyp-
tian monuments of the earliest epoch,
even before the lExodus of the Is~
raelites; which plainly removes ell
doubts as to their ntiginel invention.
Above these are curriers. chariot-

The Egyptian weights eere an en-
tire calf, the heed of an as (the half
weight) end smell oval balls (the
quatter weights); and they had e
very ingenious mode of preventing
the scale from sinking, when the ob-
ject they weighed was taken out, by
means of a ring upon the beam.

The semi-circular knife used for
cutting leather is precisely similar to
that employed in Europe at the pre-
sent day for the seme purpose, of
which there are several instances in
other parts of Thebes; and another
point is here satisfactorily established,
that the Egyptian cheiiots were of
wood. end not of breeze, as some
have imagined.

Thebes, since it throws more light
on the manners and customs of the
Egyptians then any hitherto disco-
vered.
