The columns had palm-tree capi-
tals, like the building that contained
the tomb of Amasis, in the sacred
enclosure of Sa'is, mentioned by He-
rodotus. They seem to have been
more common in temples of the
Delta than in those of Upper Egypt.

The river has now completed the
destruction of the temple; but I
believe that more is attributable to
the removal of the stones to build
the palace of Osioot; and this is
another on the list of monuments
destroyed by the ignorance or indo-
lence of the Turks.

Nothing remains at Gow in its
miginal position. excepting some
small stones; and of the columns
little can be traced but broken frag-
ments, with mutilated hieroglyphics.

Here and there some Ptolema’ic
names may be seen, but no vestige of
the Greek dedication. The monolith
still remains near the centre of the
ruins. There are also some very
large blocks lying about, and on a
long architrave half covered by the

killed by Hercules, in the time of
Osiris. Of these two fables, we may
in vain endeavour to discover the
origin or the meaning; but it is pro-
bable that the story of Ant-us is
a Greek perversion of some legend,
as his name is corrupted from that of
one of the ancient gods of the Egyp-
tian Pantheon. Antlopolis was in
later times a bishop's see.
