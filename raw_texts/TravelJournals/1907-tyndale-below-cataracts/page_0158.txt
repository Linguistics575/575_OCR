BELOW THE CATARACTS

Weigall, was, much to his credit, equally keen on
its remaining in its proper surroundings, and was
willing to hold himself responsible for its keeping.
Its impressiveness would have been slightly impaired
by the iron gates necessary to prevent it from
wanton mischief, or from thieves carrying it away
in fragments on the chance of selling them to relic
hunters ; but, standing in this niche, in the base of
these imposing cliffs, near Hatshepsu’s sanctuary, to
which it belongs, it would have been a far more
impressive sight than it is where it now stands in
the Cairo museum. The lining of the shrine has
also been set up in the same museum, but the un-
fortunate resemblance which it now bears to a large
dog kennel is bound to strike every one.

The accompanying illustration gives the upper
terrace of Mentuhotep’s temple, with the ruined
base of the pyramid to the right. The southern
end of the later temple is in the middle distance,
and the cliffs that enclose the valley form the
background. In the second hollow to the left is
the Spot where the Hathor cow was found, but,
thongh well within the area of Mentuhotep’s
sanctuary, it had no connection with it save that
of locality. It was an outlying shrine of the
marvellous temple which Queen Hatshepsu erected
after the one we are now on had fallen into ruin ;
and there are evidences that both had been restored
