reserved for the men.

Leaving the nave and passing into what corre—
Sponds to a choir we face three altars, each standing
in a circular apse and surmounted by a dome.
Screens again hide these altars, and that which
veils the high altar is more delicate in design and
richer in material than any other ; its lattice work
is formed of little crosses carved in ebony and
ivory. During the celebration of the Mass these
doors are opened and the curtain is withdrawn, and
a large image of Christ is seen above the altar. The
coloured ostrich eggs which hang from the ceiling
form a curious decoration. These are occasionally
seen in mosques, and are also used to adorn the
chapel of St. Helena in the church of the Holy
Sepulchre at Jerusalem.

A ﬂight of steps in the choir lead down to the
crypt, in which we are shown a seat upon which
the Holy Family rested on their journey to Egypt.
There was some difﬁculty in getting permission to
sketch in any of these Coptic churches, and it was
not until I was staying at the excavators’ camp at
Abydos that I was able to do so.

A small Christian colony inhabits an early
dynasty fort in the desert west of the temple of
Seti, which is known as the Coptic convent.
