Egypt has formed a part of the Mohammedan

world.

But the Copts soon discovered that they had
merely changed masters: the rule of the Moslem
was possibly gentler than that of their fellow—
Christians———the slight difference of whose doctrines
perhaps few could understand—but, cut off from
the support of the mother church, there remained
but little earthly help for them to look to when
less tolerant rulers succeeded Amr. Many of the
weaker brethren must have safeguarded their lives
and property by embracing the dominant faith,
and others must have fallen in defending the creed
of their fathers. The remnant is now not more
than a tenth of the population of Egypt; but
when we consider how the Saracens suffered from
the repeated crusades, we wonder that any have
been able to survive the vengeance of Islam.
Many of them now hold high positions in the
Government, and their business aptitude ﬁts them
well for the places they ﬁll in most of the public
ofﬁces.

On leaving the “ Kasr esh-Shéma,” as the Arabs
term this fortress, we skirt round a part of the
walls and cross the rubbish heaps that separate us
from Amr’s mosque. These rubbish heaps are all
that remain of Fostat, the ﬁrst town the Moslem
invaders built in Egypt ; still less is visible of the
