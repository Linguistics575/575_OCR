might possibly have been the prettiest subject for

perhaps this is just as well, for it is a pearl that
should not be cast before,—well, let us say,
any but those who are able to appreciate its
beauty.

From here we can join the Avenue Mohammed
Ali, near the Arab museum, and so return to the
heart of the European quarter.
