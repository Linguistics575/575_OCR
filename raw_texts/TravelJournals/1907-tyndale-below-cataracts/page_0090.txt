The Jewish quarter lies at the hack of the

occasion from the Nuhﬁssin. We pass this on our

the Mﬁristan of Kalaﬁn. By a curious chance, a
modern dispensary has been set up here. and the
sick people awaiting their turn to have their
ailments attended to by an up to date native
doctor, can recall the time when this Mﬁristan
was the great hospital of Cairo.

Saladin had anticipated the great work of the
sultan Kalaﬁn by more than a century. The
Spanish Arab, Ibn Gubeyr, who visited Cairo in
the twelfth century, gives a detailed account of it,
and, in the able translation of his travels by Mr.
Guy Le Strange, we read that Saladin " was
prompted to the meritorious deed of establishing
this hoSpital solely by the hope of gaining favour
with God and recompense in the world to come."
