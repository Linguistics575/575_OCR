BELOW THE CATARACTS

some lion—headed goddesses cast their shadows on
the waters. An indeﬁnable charm is here that is
generally absent from a show—place; and, as I
often wandered here in the cool of the evening,
or by the light of the moon, I do not associate it
with the heat and glare of the great temple
enclosure ; which makes me liable to overestimate
its charm compared with the more important
monuments in its neighbourhood.

The temple of Khons, situated nearer the river,
and north of that of Mut, is the best preserved of
the three shrines which Ramses III. erected at
Karnak. Though not built during the best period
of Egyptian architecture, it is of especial interest
from the fact of its being very nearly complete.
Visitors are often taken here before seeing the
masses of ruin in the enclosure sacred to Ammon.
Seeing one temple in its entirety helps one to
understand and reconstruct many of the fallen ones
that one sees later on. So much of the roof
remains that one gets the dim religious light
wholly absent in the rooﬂess remains of the
earlier temples. The great portal of Euergetes I.
stands a little way in front of this shrine of Khons,
and an avenue of Sphinxes built by the last of the
Ramesides precedes it. An outlying part of the
village lies near this handsome portal, and between
the date palms arise some of the ram—headed

trunk shows above the soil. We were wont
to pass here after our rambles round the temple
of Mut, and the growing darkness made it
diﬁcult to ﬁnd our way until we had cleared
the palm groves and reached the open ground
that separated Karnak from the Nile.

At length the summer heat obliged us to go
north, and we drifted down the river ; feeling that
we were only beginning to know something of
these famous ruins and their possibilities for
pictorial treatment.
