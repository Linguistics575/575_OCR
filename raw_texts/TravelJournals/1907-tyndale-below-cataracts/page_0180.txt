bear witness to her feuds with father, husband, and
brother, and over her efFaced pictures are inscribed
the ﬁgures, or cartouches, of the three Thothmes.
Possibly these served as a lesson to Ramses III.
when he had the walls of his temple inscribed so
deeply. We pass on through a pylon erected by
Taharqa of the twenty-ﬁfth dynasty—the Tirharkah
of the Bible—and we enter a delightful little
chapel of Nektanebos, the last Pharaoh of the
last dynasty (thirtieth). Eight clustered papyrus
columns with budded capitals once supported the
roof; two only now stand in their entirety.
These columns, connected by a stone screen and
backed by the Taharqa pylon, make a charming
group from outside, while the great pylon of the
tenth Ptolemy leads us into a colonnaded vestibule,
and a large courtyard ends this series of temples.

That this work of both Nektanebos and the
Ptolemy were done after some of Ramses’ great
structure had fallen in partial ruin, is evidenced by
its being carried right across the inner and outer en-
closing walls of the temple area ; it also encroaches
on a part of the site of Ramses' pavilion. This
pavilion, of which the central part only remains,
forms the great entrance to the temple area. It is
not a structure of great beauty, but it is very in-
teresting, as being the only standing remains of a
secular building of any importance.
