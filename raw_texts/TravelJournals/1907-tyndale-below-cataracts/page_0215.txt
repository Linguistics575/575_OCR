most rows of columns that support the aisles.
What we will term the nave, for lack of a better
term, forms in itself three great aisles. The less
lofty ones to the right and left of it are each
supported by seven rows of columns, which, with
the outer walls, each form seven lesser aisles.

The effect of these I 34 columns is most impos-
ing; but the girth of each one is so great that
their bases cover a very great proportion of the
ﬂooring of the interior. Whether this be archi-
tecturally right I should not like to assert, but the
effect it produces is grand in the extreme. That
it takes six men with outstretched arms to span
one of these colossal columns in the nave may give
some idea of their girth; their height is 69 feet,
and the abaci and blocks of stone that support the
roof make the total height of the exterior of this
nave 78 feet. The architraves above the aisle
columns rise to about the height of the shafts of
the centre ones. Some of these had fallen seven 1,
or eight years ago, and it was interesting to hear
from M. Legrain of the manner in which he
raised them and replaced the huge blocks of stone
that surmount and tie the colonnades. The means
