 

BELOW THE CATARACTS

There is nothing in the exterior of the church
of St. George to suggest the richness of its interior
decoration, and this applies to the six other
churches hidden away in this fortress. To escape
notice, and to avoid any display that might awaken
the cupidity of their neighbours, is the eXplanation
given by some for this simple exterior, but as the
exteriors of the earliest mosques were equally plain,
there is nothing peculiar in this feature. With the
exception of the crypt, which dates previous to the
Moslem conquest, this church was built not long
after Ibn-Tulun had completed his great mosque,
and nothing could be plainer than the outside of
the latter. The person who unbolts the massive
door takes care to shut out the rest of our followers,
for it is just as well not to share the baksheesh with
too many. We cross a small vestibule, which
screens the interior from the outside should the
door happen to be open, and enter a beautiful little
basilica, two rows of arches separate the aisles from
the nave, which appears short to our eyes, for a
handsome wooden screen divides the church in
two at some 'distance from the sanctuary. The
dim light from the small triforium windows is
caught by a row of saints above the screen; it is
reﬂected here and there on the gold halo of an
ikon, and ﬂickers down the carved woodwork.
During the services the women must keep to the

toe
