BELOW THE CATARACTS

proved that if a tooth aches very much, and you
pull it out and fasten it to the door, it will very soon
cease to give you pain ! Mothers will bring sore—

eyed children and press their faces against the wood-

work ; and it is as well for the unbeliever not to
attempt a similar cure, for he might get a worse
disease than the one he was seeking to relieve. A
queer-looking saint occasionally squats in front of
this door, who is an object of great veneration. No
mediwval artist has ever clad a Lazarus in such a
patchwork of rags. His wild look, and the spear
he clutches, prevents even the “ Giour ” from treat-
ing him with disrespect. What the connection of
this saint and the mysterious “cl—Mitwelli” is I
have never been able to fathom, but I shall try
again when next I set up my easel within reach of
his spear.

The accompanying illustration is from a drawing
I made of the twin minarets of El Muaiyad, which
rise so gracefully from the blood—stained Bab ez—
Zuwéleh. The intervening houses hide the gate-
way that has taxed the powers of many brother
brushes to get an adequate presentment of. The
space around it is too conﬁned to get it within the
focus of a picture; and perhaps it is just as well
that the shambles from which these lovely minarets
spring should be hidden, even as the garden soil hides
the ﬁlth lying at the roots of two beautiful lilies.
