THE MosoUE or IBN TULt‘IN

CONTINUING our walk in a southerly direction
along what might be called the “Faubourg St.
Germain ” of the old town, we pass the mosque
of Ezhek el-Yuseﬁ and wander on through some
deserted looking streets until we reach the
“Sharia” Tulﬁn. The houses about here appear
more dilapidated than ever, but here and there a ﬁne
display of meshrebiya bay windows and a handsome
doorway remind us that we are still in what was
once the aristocratic part of the city. A sharp
turning takes you up a narrow lane and you are at
the entrance gate of the mosque of Ibn Tulﬁn.
Little of the exterior is 1risible from here as partly
ruined houses butt against the outside walls. We
mount a ﬂight of stairs, pass under a high arch-
way, and enter the outer court which extends
round three sides of this huge enclosure. We then
ascend some more steps on our left. pass through
one of the cloisters of the Liwan, and enter the
