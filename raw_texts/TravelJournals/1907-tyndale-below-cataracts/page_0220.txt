remaining part of the sky—line. A ﬂight of steps
cut out of one block of stone seems still to puzzle
the archaeologists. It is very similar to the stair-
case of the altar of sacriﬁce in Hatshepsu's temple
at Dér el—Bahri, and it is possible that the same
queen may have erected one here.

All we see here takes us, in successive stages,
from the consolidation of the New Empire to the
time when Egypt had fallen under the rule of the
Greeks.

To the east of the sanctuary little but the
foundations remain of the twelfth dynasty temple.
The lapse of time between these relics and the
building of Seti’s great hall would embrace our
own history from the period of the Norman
conquest to the present day. Yet Seti is no
modern, for the Pharaoh of the oppression, re-
ferred to in the ﬁrst chapter of Exodus, is
identiﬁed with his successor.

striking nor even imposing after seeing the work
of Seti ; though, were this the only building in this
great enclosure, it might be both. The roof is
supported by thirty-four square pillars and two
rows of columns. The latter are more extraordi—
nary than beautiful ; for the inverted calyx capitals,
and the downward tapering of the shafts, give them
a topsy-turvy look that is not pleasing. Much of
the inscribed work is beautiful, but time has dealt
badly with it. In a chamber to the north of
the ruined sanctuary the walls are covered with
reliefs of plants and animals that Thothmes is said
to have brought back from Syria. They are drawn
