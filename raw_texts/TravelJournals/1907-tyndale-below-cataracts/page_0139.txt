ME, ,9” the dahabiyeh, after the noise, heat, ﬂies
@1313 all” other unpleasantnesses which the close
a. u 11* it)? of these people entails, is a joy indeed.
- e :clang and clamour of the works near us had
opted, and no sound but the occasional plashing
oi." 'an oar would disturb us While enjoying a
ﬁeaceful cigarette and watching the sunset from
, the deck.

To sail up to Thebes on my friend’s dahabiyeh
was a pleasure time would not permit me to enjoy.
’I- had spent some weeks on the Mani: in the-
-,previous Spring, when we were drifting down the
L Hitler, and I appreciated what I was losing in not
.jbeing able to accept my friend’s invitation. The
. {Prospects of rejoining him at Karnak, when the
*“ Seasons work at Dér el— Bahri would be ended,
somewhat consoled me. A nights journey in the
nor train is a much more prosaic mode of pro-
-_ e #51011, but the two or three weeks time needed
{in s. i .that distance was out of the question.
