PORT SAID

As I revise these notes made during my last stay
in Egypt,I read an announcement in the Press of a
new line of English Turbine Steamers to Egypt
(“ The Egyptian Mail Steamship Co.”) which will
do the trip from Marseilles in three, from Naples
in two, days. Things change quickly, for only
last year I underwent no less than four days of
boredom and biliousness between Brindisi and Port
Said on a steamer that had to pass through the Suez
Canal on its way to the Far East. There seemed
to be no end to my discomfort, when I was suddenly
awakened to the full consciousness of my existence
by a remark, made half to himself by a fellow-
passenger with his eye glued to a telescope,—
“Yes, that is Egypt right enough.” I soon satis-
ﬁed myself that his eye needed a rest, and, begging
leave to have a peep myself, with trembling ﬁngers
I adjusted the focus till the low—lying coast of
Egypt was plainly visible.
