 

THE MOSQUE OF IBN TULUN

Perhaps amost impressive sight to us now is
this great desolate mosque immediately beneath us.
The veneration the site was held in must have
attracted thousands of worshippers ; the various
tribes that composed the Emir’s army, who were
quartered in the cantonments just outside, will
have ﬁlled this great court when some noted
Sheykh preached here to inﬂame their enthusiasm
before starting on their campaigns. Saladin will
here have offered up thanks to Allah after worsting
the Crusaders, and have prayed that the Crescent
might ﬁnally triumph over the Cross. But the belief
that prayers are more likely to be answered in this
sacred spot than in any other fails to draw worship-
pers here now. That it might be haunted with
“ Aﬁrits ” might easily suggest itself to the imagi-
native oriental, and he might feel safer in repairing
to a less dilapidated place of worship, and one less
frequented by these unpleasant beings. The artist
who ﬁghts shy of an admiring crowd may work
here in safety, and may thank the lurking “ Affrit ”
for so effectually keeping off the small boys.

We now follow the “ Sharia Tulﬁn ” for about
half a mile, when we come in sight of the mosque of
Mohammed Ali which crowns the citadel. There
is always something to interest one while strolling
along any of these streets, for every important event
in the life of the Cairene has some manifestation in

67 F2.
