part of the ﬁrst century, when Egypt became a
Roman province; and though what we actually
see now was erected by the Emperor Augustus, it

The effect of this fafade is very ﬁne ; the detail, as
in most work of this period, suggests the skilled
workman rather than the artist, but it keeps its
place in this nobly designed building. It is
difﬁcult to compare this exterior with that of any
temple of the eighteenth dynasty, as we have here
the advantage of seeing the architect’s elevation in
its entirety ; whereas in the earlier work so much
is missing that one rather looks for picturesque
bits than tries to study what their effect as a whole
would be. Six Hathor—headed columns support
the architrave and the bold concave cornice, and
the winged sun-disk decorates the Space over the
doorway. The three columns at each side of the
entrance are joined by a balustrade that reaches
halfway up the shafts. The pronaos, or vestible,
again compares favourably with those of the earlier
temples, as the eighteen columns that spring from
the ﬂoor still support the roof, and the capitals are
partly lost in the shadow.
