do Would make the yashmak quite unbearable, but
they turn away their eyes from the “ Firangi,” or
will draw the loose veil that hangs from their
heads across their faces—an intimation that their
barefacedness is a necessity which the “ Firangi”
would do well to respect.

The view from the train, over the ﬁfteen miles
that take us back to Cairo, is at its best now;
the evening light catches Gebel Turra beyond
Helwan on the further side of the Nile, and deli-
cate violet shadows in a golden mass of colour give
the drawing of the rock strata. The villages on
our left are silhouetted against the shades of the
Libyan desert and the palm groves stand out in
bold masses against the sunset sky. As we near
Cairo the line runs for a while near the river’s
edge; the light now turning to pink catches the
sails of the “ gyassas " and is repeated in a lower
tone on the Mokattam hills in the distance. Near
Gizeh the twilight lends a mystery to the groups
of ﬁgures on the Nile bank and the sails of the
boats, until, grey against the afterglow reﬂected on
the hills, the little town itself, which is not parti-
cularly interesting in broad daylight, suggests all
sorts of possibilities in the increasing darkness. In
due course we reach gaslit Cairo, feeling grateful
for the beautiful evening that has ended so into-
resting a day.
