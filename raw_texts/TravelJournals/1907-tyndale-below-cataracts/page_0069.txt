looking crosswise through these arcades into the
patch of sunlight in the open court. A curious
corkscrew shaped tower, which can hardly be called
a minaret, rises out of the walls at the north—east
corner. This is well worth ascending, for you will
obtain a grand view of Cairo from its summit.
Nearly the whole of the old quarters of the city
are spread out to the north of you. Innumerable
domes and minarets rise everywhere from this
mass of houses; some singly, while others, where
they are relieved one against the rest, appear to
be in clusters. Were Ibn Tulﬁn permitted in Spirit
to see this sight, he would ﬁnd it hard to realise
that he was standing on the tower he built. In his
day, nothing of what we now behold existed. Save
a few Arab tents, not a habitation was here ; there
was then only marshy land, submerged during the
;;high Nile, to your left, and a sandy waste to the
