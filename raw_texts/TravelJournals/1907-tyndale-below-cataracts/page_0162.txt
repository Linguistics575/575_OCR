the skilled workmen of the eighteenth dynasty
which the public would desire to see.

To instruct the peasants who were my assistants
in an art that I had ﬁrst to learn myself was
no easy matter with my very imperfect know-
ledge of Arabic. Currelly gave me all the assist-
ance he could, but, after the advent of Professor
N aville, the Opening of the tomb at the Mentuhotep
temple monopolised all his time and thoughts.
However, I found the half-dozen Arabs, whose
work I was directing, were quick at learning and
took a great interest in their occupation. As better
results were obtained we increased their pay, and
by the time I was satisﬁed that the casts were as
good as one could wish their pay had risen to
treble what they received while on the dig. Be
it said that the wages from “cl Kompania, as
they call the Egyptian EXploration Fund, are
extremely low, and less than the earnings of
labourers employed on any other class of work,
which gave me a shrewd suspicion that the
chances of concealing scarabs or other small
antiquities about their person is an inducement
to them to work at so low a wage.

By an increase of pay it does not follow that
their hands would be kept from picking and
stealing, for the “fellah,” whom you might trust
with anything else, is not to be trusted for an
164.
