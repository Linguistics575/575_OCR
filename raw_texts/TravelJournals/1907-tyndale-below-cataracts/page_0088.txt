may only break it when they are nursing a
child, and they have to make up for it when the

shrine of some favourite saint, and one of these
which has some miraculous power of curing
barrenness is especially favoured.

The street which this mosque is in is a parti—

mosque of El—Merdani we are on familiar ground,
and the beautiful Muaiyad minarets soon come
into sight. Leaving the Bab Zuwéleh on our
right, after just glancing to see if the holy man of
the rags and the Spear still sits there, we notice on
our left an unpretentious little mosque entrance
at the top of a stairway. I say “mosque,"
because it is the custom to call most places con—

cloister, and two or three more steps take us into
an ideal courtyard. Two sides are covered with

tiles, and in the centre of one is a pretty “ Kibleh,"
