Tdisappearin g ; it is hard that their picturesque dress
should not be left to them.

We will walk a little further down this street till
we reach a pretty “ seb‘il ” on our left ; then, turning
sharply round this fountain, we face the entrance
to one of these Khedival schools. The illustration
is from a drawing I did some ten years ago, before
these sumptuary laws came into force. The young-
sters as they hurry out of the school now make a
very different picture. Suits, cheaply run together
in some sweater’s den in Europe, have replaced the
“ gelabieh ” and ﬂowing “ tob.” The change seems
to have affected their manners as well as their
appearance, for their bearing is now no more

,digniﬁed than their clothes. Their former robes
were easier to wash than tweed suits are ; thus
lifrom a sanitary point of view there is a distinct loss,
- 'zand I have heard the poorer natives complain of
libe extra expense that this new outﬁt entails.
The argument that they are not compelled to send
their children to these schools is not worth
“answering.
: i'Let us now skirt round this building and take a
the in a southerly direction. High walls here
GI! lose the gardens of some pashas house. We
ﬁnd] ow these, and pass one or two mosques of more
Wyessguimportance, but each with some character
