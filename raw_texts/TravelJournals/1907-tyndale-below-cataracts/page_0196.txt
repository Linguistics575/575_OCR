THE MENTUHOTEP TEMPLE

of dust with shreds of mummy-cloth was all that
was visible of the body which this tomb was so
carefully built to conceal. The heat was so great
that the wax candles we held bent and softened in
our hands. We had left most of our clothes out—
side, and though we had little enough on, that
little was almost unbearable. The enclosed air was
stiﬂing, and the desire to get out dominated all
other sensations. The dramatic sight which we
had witnessed in the tomb in the neighbouring
valley was absent here; the heap of brown dust
lying in the corner awakened no more feelings of
awe than a sackful of guano shot there might have
done, and what little vitality remained to us after
breathing this fcetid atmoSphere was required to
crawl up the long shaft to get into the open air.
That brown heap was probably the remains of
Mentuhotep, but one must be cautious in making
such assertions.

It was, anyhow, an important ﬁnd ; and as, day
by day, the contents of the mortuary chamber
were brought up to the hut, it became increasingly
evident that they had been intended for the fur-
niture of a royal tomb. The sorting and packing
of all these things took some time, and our nightly'
attempts to piece the broken fragments together
had to be abandoned, as there seemed no end to
their number.
