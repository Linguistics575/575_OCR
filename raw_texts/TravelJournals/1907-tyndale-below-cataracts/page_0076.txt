which Joseph was cast by his brethren, and though
tradition is out in its topography by some 3oo
miles, this story is still ﬁrmly believed by many,
and is solemnly repeated by some of the dragomans.

scripture, it is interesting to learn that it takes its
name from “ Salﬁhedden Y-ﬁsuf,” the saladin of the
Crusaders, who constructed the citadel in the
twelfth century. Two “ sakiyehs,” worked by
oxen, bring the water to the surface.

reminded of the position England holds in this
country by meeting a squad of ‘ Tommies ’ ascend—
