BELOW THE CATARACTS

and set up in some suburban villa. at home, it
appears singularly out of place. Tons of this
woodwork have been bought by dealers, and sold
to tourists to be made up into draughty screens,
summer houses, and even picture-frames, which
are all doomed to be cast aside later, when the
unfortunate purchaser has fuliy realised the un—
suitableness of his bargain. I know of one case
where the woodwork of a ﬁne old Cairene house
has been rotting in a barn in Surrey ever since the
despoiler brought it to England some forty years
Struck by its beauty when he saw it in its
roper surroundings, he hoped that his architect
would be able to make use of it for a house he
was about to build; but the sunlight of Surrey
could not stand such an amount of subduing ; the
Nordracht treatment had not then brought draughts
into fashion; nor did his women-folk see the

necessity for hiding their pretty faces behind the

lattice.
The regrettable part is that this old woodwork

is never replaced in Cairo, for, as the houses in the
older parts of the city do not repay their owners,
the drainage has been shockingly neglected, and
those who can afford it clear out and build some
bastard—looking modern house in the newer

quarters.
