Thothmosid feuds are visible on the polished surface
of the stone, also those of the religious revolution
of Ikhnaton, where the ﬁgure of Ammon had been
effaced, to be restored during Seti’s reign, when
the worship of that god was ﬁrmly re—established.
Beyond this, the ﬁfth pylon starting from the river
is another colonnaded court of Thothmes I., ﬂanked

pylon, we enter the forecourt of the sanctuary.
The granite gateway of the last and smallest pylon
has some beautiful work inscribed on its sides, with
characteristic ﬁgures of Nubian and Syrian prisoners
taken by the third Thothmes. The same Pharaoh

the sanctuary. The mutilated statue of Thothmes
III. has been placed in the dilapidated boudoir
of his half-sister and queen. Above rises the
