venturesome mouse; a chirp from a sparrow, in
whose movements he also takes a kindly interest,
may divert his eyes for a moment; but, with an
unspoken———“ I'll attend to you presently,” he
directs them again to the all-engrossing hole in
the wall.

The “sala” concluded, we may return to the
sanctuary, while the worshippers pick up their
slippers, which lie on the step that descends to the
court, and carry them to the entrance, where they
put them on and return to their various advoca—
tions. Except on Fridays, there appears to be no
one to lead the services; the men fall into rows
before the “Kibleh,” and go through certain
prostrations in a given order, while reciting the
prescribed verses of the Koran. Women never
attend these prayers, which probably accounts for
the fallacious idea, held in Europe, that Moham—
medans consider that women have no souls. A
Moslcm might almost equally argue that the
English believe that women alone have them,
if he were to witness some of our services where
the ladies form nearly the whole of the congrega-
tion. The social relations of the sexes oblige
the women to say their prayers apart from the
men, but they have to keep the fast of Ramadan
as strictly as their brothers; which would be
the reﬁnement of cruelty if they have no souls
