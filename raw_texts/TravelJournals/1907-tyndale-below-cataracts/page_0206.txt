host had run down to Cairo for a few days, but
Mr. Harold Jones and Mr. Blackman were superin-
tending the work. Howard Carter also was staying
there, bent on the same work as I had come to
do—to make some studies of the Seti has-reliefs.
The house was planned with great skill, to keep
the living room cool and to accommodate six
people, without unduly drawing on the funds at
the diSposal of the excavation, and the lunch
showed that Harold Jones could keep house as
well as plan one. Having had nothing since a
hurried breakfast at ﬁve a.m., I was able to do this
meal full justice. The heat is so great that as the
season advances the afternoon “ siesta ” grows from
a luxury into a necessity. Work becomes impos-
sible from one till four; it is therefore well to
shorten one’s rest at night and resume it in the
early afternoon.
