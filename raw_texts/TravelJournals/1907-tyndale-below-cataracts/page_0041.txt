his Kodak ; but whether he records the camel, or
only a passing sunshade, does not seem to disturb

him very much. Facing you, on one side of
the stairs of the mosque of Ghﬁri, and almost
hidden by the awnings of the adjoining booth, there
is a little passage which leads into the scent bazaar.
Here you are offered, for four or ﬁve shillings, a
little phial of attar of roses containing four or ﬁve
drops. This covered passage, with the usual cup-
board-like shops and “mastaba,” leads into a maze of
narrow lanes, in each of which one particular trade
is plied, or one class of goods sold. The spice
bazaar is particularly interesting, and often more
beautiful in colour than any other; cinnamon,
cloves, nutmegs and aloes heaped around the
merchant harmonise deliciously with his silk
robes, and the bags, baskets and matting that
comprise the furniture of his shop. You can
wander next through the Tunis and Algerian
bazaars, others given up to shoemakers and to
dealers in woollen goods from Arabia, and so work
your way once more into the main street not far
from the great mosque of El Muaiyad.

This imposing building was erected by the Cir-
cassian Mameluke Sultan, El Muaiyad, in 14.16, to
serve as a “ medresseh ” or college, many of which
existed at that period : but as the students gradually
ﬂocked to the “azhar,” these “medressa” were
