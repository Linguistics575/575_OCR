To the ,right lie the Ramesseum, with Seti’s
temple to the left, while, across the river, and near
its banks, stand the great colonnades of Luxor and
the huge pylon of Karnak.

In 1894—95 the entire temple was exhumed by
Professor N aville, who gave his services, the
Egyptian Exploration Fund defraying the cost of
the work.

Most of my assistants in the casting of Punt
increased in knowledge, and those who proved
too stupid to learn returned to the “ dust,” as they
termed the excavations. One of the remaining
men showed an especial aptitude, which bespoke
long practice in the manufacture of fakes—im—
postures—now treasured by many a tourist as gems
picked up by good luck from an Arab who had got
them, “ we won’t say 12m I ” (a wink here from the
tourist). This man spoke a few words of English,
which I allowed him to air. I have forgotten his
name, but his solemnly calling out—“ Tyndale,
Koom ! ” whenever he wished me to come and see
his work, obtained him the name of “ Tyndale
Koom ”; and as such I can only remember him.
Be it explained that it was not in undue familiarity
thatI was so addressed; for, except when such
titles as Bey or Pasha had been acquired, this rather
servile creature would have addressed any of his
co—religionists, whatever their position might be,
by the name their parents had given them.
