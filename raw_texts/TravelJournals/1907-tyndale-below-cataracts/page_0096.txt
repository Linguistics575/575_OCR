of the I 1th century by the famous vizier Bedr e1-
Gamali. The mosque of Hakim, dating from a
century earlier, nearly ﬁlls up the space between
these two gates. Napoleon quartered some of his
troops here in 1799, fully realising the strength of
the position.

These two gates, together with the Bab Zuweleh,
have puzzled a good many archaeologists. Their
style is not Saracenic ; it savours more of the
Norman. M. van Berchem, who has made a special
study of the old enceinte of the city, describes them
as of the Templars’ style of military architecture,
but as they were erected some ten years before the
date of the ﬁrst crusade, this inﬂuence upon their
style seems extraordinary. Van Berchem discovered
Greek mason's marks, which accord with their
Byzantine appearance, and, as the great vizier Bedr
was an Armenian, it is probable that he sought his
architect among his own countrymen. We are,
however, more concerned with their pictorial
aspect; and, impressive as they are, it is difﬁcult
to give a satisfactory presentment of them.

The ruined mosque of el—Hﬁkim that ﬁlls most of
the angle in the city wall, connecting the two
gates, is a capital sketching ground. It is of itself
less impressive than that of Ibn Tulun, which
it resembles in plan ; but, being more accessible to
the outside world, one can use the great courtyard
