THE MOSQUE OF SULTAN HASAN

years later, intent on trying to reproduce my ﬁrst
impressions of the court and the great span of the
arch which frames in the sanctuary, I was deterred
from setting up my easel by the sight of scaffoldings
and the noise of workmen. Great cobwebby bits
of the frieze, with its Kuﬁc inscriptions, were
heaped about on the ﬂoor, mouldy slabs of coloured
stone had been taken out of the panels to be squared
up and cleaned before being cemented into their
original places,——a necessary work, no doubt, and
it is a blessing that it is directed by such able hands,
but it sadly resembles one of those “ blessings in dis—
guise,” which we are told to be thankful for, when
laid low by a severe visitation of Providence 1
Having gone so far in this work, would that they
could go a step further, and rehang the handsome
bronze lamps that at various times have been pur—
loined. Some of the best of these are now in e
Arab museum, but they would look incomparably .
better in the surroundings for which they were$3f ‘ 1
designed. The arguments I have repeatedly heard,
—that valuable objects are liable to be stolen from '
the mosques—can hardly apply to a lamp weighing
about a ton. Some of these, which are ticketed and
catalogued in the museum, have been replaced in
their legitimate home by lamps that would disgrace
a merry-go-round l
