Khephren is nearly as important, and that besides
the three principal ones there are six smaller ones,
this one will have exhausted all your resources of awe
and wonderment. Of the “ seven wonders of the

Nose and part of the upper lip are gone, and
also the beard. The general outline of the
shoulders remains, but no detail is seen in the mass
that supports the head but the stratiﬁcations of the
rock out of which this titanic bust was hewn. A
broken stone causeway proceeds from the right of
this mass, and if we stand at a proper distance to

of a forearm and the outstretched ﬁngers of a hand.
