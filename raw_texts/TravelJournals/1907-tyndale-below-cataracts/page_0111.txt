BELOW THE caﬁﬁnacrs

Guides will point out the column in front of
the pulpit, with the “Kurbﬁg” of the prophet
drawn by the veins in the grey marble, and they
will tell you how this column ﬂew through the air
from the Kaaba at Mekka to help Amr in building
his mosque. They are somewhat out in their
chronology, but these stories are interesting. It
is prophesied the fall of Islam will coincide with
the fall of this mosque, but from its poor state
of repair, the faithful must take this with a grain
of salt.

There is not much to detain us here. The vast
court with the fountain in the centre is very im-
pressive, but its historical associations can be studied
at home in an arm—chair.

A walk or donkey ride from here to the tombs
of the Mamelukes in a north—easterly direction is

catches the citadel mosque, which looks well at a
distance, also the Mokattam hills, with the little
mosque of Giyushi beyond. A pale, broad shadow
slowly creeps across the foreground, and ugly details
are lost in its subduing effect. The deepening
