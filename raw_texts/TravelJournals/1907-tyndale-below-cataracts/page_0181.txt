As the later temples arose, so the earlier ones
declined, if they were not actually in use. A quarry
so near at hand, with ready cut stones, was too
tempting not to be made use of; and inscriptions
of the earlier temples can be traced on blocks of
stone used in the later ones. It is strange that the
ruins of the Christian village, east of the great
temple, should show only crumbling walls of mud
brick. The village church stood in the centre of
the second court, and this also was built of this
poor material, when so much dressed stone lay all
around.

The magniﬁcent Amenhotep III. built his
sumptuous palace near these temples of Medinet
Habu, but hardly a trace of this now remains ; it
had probably fallen into ruin when Ramses III.
was erecting his great temple. That “this world
is no abiding city ” was more than a mere phrase
in Pharaonic times is here exempliﬁed, for amongst
the numerous dwelling places prepared for the dead,
or dedicated to the gods, nothing now remains
standing of what was inhabited by the living. The
great palaces that must have existed in Thebes,
both to house the kings and the great nobles, were
all built of mud—bricks, durable enough for a life-

time, but leaving nothing but some fragments of
pavement by which posterity can judge of their
splendours. Fortunately, we ﬁnd some records of

AMONG THE TEMPLES

these habitations on the walls of the tombs and the
temples; and Specimens of the furniture, housed
in the lasting abodes of the dead, give us some idea
of the daily life of these people.

The pavilion of Ramses III., part of which we
have now seen, suggests a fortress more than a
palace, and that warrior king possibly built it in
stone for strategic reasons rather than as a tem-
porary residence.
