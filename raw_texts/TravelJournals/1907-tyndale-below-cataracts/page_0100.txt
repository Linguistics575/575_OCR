in what is, at present, the centre of Cairo, but
what, in their days, was outside their capital, which
lay to the south, and of which very few vestiges

site of this earlier burial place; and we are told
that when it was built the bones of the Caliphs
were dug up, carried away on asses’ backs, and shot
on to the rubbish hills.

One of the ﬁrst tombs we approach,——el—Seb’a
Benat, “ the seven sisters,“——is evidence that others
besides Mamelukes lay here, but who these seven
ladies were I have not been able to discover. As
space does not allow of an examination of more
than the outside of these tombs, we will make
for one on the eastern side of the group; that
of the Sultan Kait Bey. The tomb of Sultan
Barkuk, on our left, has two beautiful domes and a
pair of minarets. It is worth making a careful
study of the designs on each of the many domes as
we pass along. The general plan of each tomb
differs slightly ; but, on close examination, one is
surprised to ﬁnd how varied the detail is. The
mausoleum of Kait Bey is the ﬁnest here, and its
slender minaret and beautifully decorated dome
surpass all others. It has all the appointments of a
congregational mosque ; the fountain, surmounted
by the arcaded school-room, to the left of the high
entrance, which has handsome bronze-mounted
