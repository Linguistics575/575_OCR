MASR EL KAHIRA

Zalat. The sights become more bewildering as we
get nearer the heart of the city ; and as the street
narrows so- the noise increases. Camels move
slowly along, quite indifferent to the excitable
cabmen, who may be cursing the shades of their
fathers because they do not get out of the way;
the man with the long—bodied and seatless donkey-
cart that still does duty as an omnibus joins in the
clamour; “ May your women—folk only hear pigs ! "
he yells out to the camel—driver, and should the
block become apparently hopeless, advice is shouted
out by most of the onlookers, while some jest
from a donkey-boy who has managed to squeeze
his beast through sets the crowd laughing. Then,
somehow, the camels manage to move on, with an
expression of supreme contempt for the curses,
jeers and jests that have been showered upon them
and their drivers.

As the sun gets higher in the heavens the strip
of shade narrows on the north—eastern side of the
Suk, and before one reaches the end of this long
_ street the tradesmen have let down their awnings
upon each side of the road. It is a relief to turn
the corner and not to face the sun for a while.

El Nahassin is now reached, and while the life
-and bustle are as picturesque as ever, the beauty
increases, for soon, on the right—hand side, we see
vthe domes and minarets of the group of mosques
