BELOW THE CATARACTS

of the village, and is a proof, if one were needed,
that it is not necessarily age which gives to earlier
work its chief beauty. If the proportions be good,
and the structure is in keeping with its surroundings,
it will be beautiful from the very ﬁrst ; but, on the
other hand, should the proportions be bad, and the
building ill—adapted to its site, age will never make
it ﬁne, but will at the best only help to disguise its
imperfections. My excuse for such a platitude is
that one is constantly hearing a building condemned
as ugly simply because it is new, and one is recom-
mended to see another with no virtues save that of
age. It is as unfair to the architects who do good
work now, as the collector of old masters is apt to
be to a master who has the disadvantage of being
alive.

But I had more to do in Egypt than to enjoy the
shade of the palm grove and to study the colour of
the fruit, delightful though the life was. I was
therefore compelled to take leave of my kind host
and hostess, and to wend my way to the station.

As I passed by the village the call to prayer
directed my attention once more to the whitened
minaret, and the last sound I heard was the sonorous
voice of the muezzin, “ Allah akbar, Allah akbar ! ”
