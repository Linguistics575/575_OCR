208 . LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

vently, and said one saw his good qualities in
his face ;—a Compliment I could have fully re—
turned, as he sat looking at the picture with
affectionate eyes, and praying sotto 21006 for
“el ged’a, el gemeel” (the youth, the beau-
tiful), in the words of the Fat’hah, “ Oh, give
him guidance, and let him not stray into the
paths of the rejected!” Altogether something
in Sheykh Yoosuf reminds me of Worsley.*
There is the same Seelenreinheit, with far
less thoughtfulness, and an additional child-
like innocence. I suppose some mediaaval
monks may have had the same leok, but no
Catholic I have ever seen looks so peaceful or
so unpretending. I see in him that easy fa-
miliarity with religion which characterizes all
people who don’t know what doubt means. I
hear him joke with Omar about Ramadan,
and even about Omar's assiduous prayers, and
he is a frequent and hearty laugher. I won-
der whether this gives you any idea of a cha-
racter new to you; it is so impossible to de-
scribe manner, 'which gives so much of the im-
pression of novelty.
