CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE. 105

Jew, and Christian. None have received a
faddah. It is true, the Sultan and .his suite
plundered the Pasha and the people here;
but, from all I hear, the Sultan really wishes
to do good. What is wanted here, is, hands
.to till the soil; wages are very high; food, of
course, gets dearer, the forced labour inﬂicts
more suffering than before, and the population
will decrease yet faster. This appears to me
to be a state of things in which it is of no use
to say that public works must be made at any
cost. I dare say the wealth will be increased,
if, meanwhile, the peOple are not exterminated.
The nevery new Pasha builds a huge new pa-
lace, whilst those of his predecessors fall to
ruin. Mohammad Alee’s sons even cut down
the trees of his beautiful botanical garden, and
planted beans there; so money is constantly
wasted more utterly than if it were thrown
into the Nile, for then the Fellaheen would
not have to spend the time, so much wanted
for agriculture, in building hideous barrack-
"like so-called palaces. What chokes me is,
-to hear Englishmen talk of the stick being
“ the only way to manage Arabs,” as if there
could be any doubt that it is the easiest way
