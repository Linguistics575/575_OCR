334 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

LETTER XLIX.

February, 1865.

M. PREVOST-PARADOL is here for a few days,
and I am enjoying “ a great indulgence of
talk,” as heartilyas any nigger. He is a de-
lightful person. This evening he is coming
with Arakel Bey, his Armenian companion,
and I will invite a few Arabs to show him.
A little good European talk is a very agree-
able interlude to the Arab prosiness, or rather
enfantillage, on the part of the women.

M. Paradol is intoxicated with Egypt, yet
Egypt is not itself this year. All the land here,
which last year glowed in. emerald verdure, is
now a dreary expanse of dry mud, brown and
desolate! The Nile is lower already than it
was at lowest Nile last July; it all ran away
directly this year, so that in many places there
will be no crops whatever.
