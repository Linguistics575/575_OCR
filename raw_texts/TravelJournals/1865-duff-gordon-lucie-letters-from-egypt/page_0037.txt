26 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

amusing. The young man of whom I bought
my ﬁngans was so handsome, elegant, and me-

How I wish you were here to enjoy all
this,——so new, so beautiful, and yet so fami-
liar! And you’ would like the pe0ple, poor
things! they are complete children, but ami-
able children. I went into the village here,
where I was a curiosity, and some women took
me into their houses and showed me their
sleeping-place, cookery, poultry, etc., and a man
followed me to keep off the children; but no
baksheesh was asked for, which showed that
Europeans were rare there. The utter destitu-
tion is terrible to see, though in this climate,
of course, it matters less. But the much-
talked-of dirt is simply utter poverty. The
poor souls are as clean as Nile mud and water
will make their bodies; and they have not a
second shirt, or any bed but dried mud.

My cough has been better now for ﬁve days,
without a bad return of it. It is the ﬁrst re-
prieve for so long. The sun is so hot,—a re-
gular broil (Nov. 21),-—-and all doors and win-
dows open in the cabin,-—a delicious breeze!
