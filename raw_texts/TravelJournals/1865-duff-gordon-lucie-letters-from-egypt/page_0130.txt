THE BOATS CREW 119

huts, and the men repairing the dykes. A
Frenchman told me he was on board a Pasha's
steamer, and they passed a ﬂooded village
where two hundred people. stood on their
roofs crying for help: would you, could you
believe it? they passed on and left them to
drown! Nothing but an eye-witness could
have made me believe such frightful cruelty.
All to-day we sailed 1n heavenly weather,—

‘a sky like nothing but its most beautiful self.
At the bend of the river, just now, we had a
grand struggle to get round, and got entan-
gled with a big timber-boat. My crew became
so vehement that I had to come out mth an
imperious request to every one to bless the
PrOphet. Next the boat nearly dragged the
men into the stream, and they pulled, and
hauled, and struggled, up to their waists in
mud and water; and Omar brandished his
pole,and shouted “Islam, 61 Islam!” which gave
a fresh spirt to the poor fellows, and. round we
came with a dash and caught the breeze again.
Now we have put up here for the night, and
shall pass the railway bridge to-morrow. The
railway is all under water from hence up to
T anta, eight miles, and in many places higher up.
