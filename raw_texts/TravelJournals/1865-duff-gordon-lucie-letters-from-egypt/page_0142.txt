THE LEGEND. 131

to get good mutton, and as he is an excellent
cook, I have a good dinner every day, which I
ﬁnd makes a great difference. I have also
discovered that some of the Nile ﬁsh is ex-
cellent: the bayad, which is sometimes as
much as six or eight feet long and very fat, is
delicious, and I am told there are still better
kinds; the eels are very delicate and good too.
The worst is, that everything is just double
last year’s price, as of course no beef can be
eaten at all; and the draught oxen being dead,
labour is become dear as well. The high Nile
was a small misfortune compared to the mur-
rain.

There is a legend about it, of course. A cer-
tain Sheykh-el-Beled (bitrgenneister) of some
place not named, lost his cattle, and being
rich, deﬁed God; said he did not care, and
bought as many more. They died too,iand he
continued impenitent and deﬁant, and bought
on till he was ruined; and now he is sinking
into the earth bodily, though his friends dig
and dig around him without ceasing, night
and day.

It is curious, how like the Arab legends are
to the German; all those about wasting bread
