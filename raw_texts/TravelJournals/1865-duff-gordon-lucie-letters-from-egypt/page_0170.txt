SYMPATHY WITH CRIMINALS. 159

about Muslim license. Upon this the vene-
rable Turk, who had been in Europe, asked
some questions as to the nature and number
of the Englishman’s relations to women, which _
the latter was wholly unable to answer.

“ Well, young man,” said the Turk, “ I am
old, and was married at twelve; and I have
seen, in all my life, seven women; four are
dead, and three are happy and comfortable
in my house. Where are all yours?” (As a
woman is never seen but by her husband or
possessor, the word has acquired another mean-
ing.)

I ﬁnd that the criminal convicted of ca-
lumny, accused (together with twenty-nine
others, ,not in custody) the Sheykh-el-Beled
of his village, of murdering his servant, and
produced a basketful of bones as proof; but
the Sheykh produced the living man, and his
detractor gets hard labour for life. The pro-
ceeding is characteristic of the childish ruse
of this country. I inquired whether the thief
who was dragged in chains through the streets
would be able to ﬁnd work, and was told, “Oh,
certainly,—is he not a poor man"! for the sake
of God every one will be ready to help him.”
