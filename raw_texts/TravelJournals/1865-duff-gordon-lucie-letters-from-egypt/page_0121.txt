110 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

LETTER XX.

On board the ‘ Venetian,’ June 15, 1863.

WE shall be at Malta to-morrow, Inshallah !
I feel much better since I have been at sea.
We left Alexandria on Thursday, and are very
comfortable, having the whole spacious ladies’
cabin to ourselves, and a very pleasant cap-
tain. But we are laden to the water’s edge,
and a gale in “ the Bay ” would be very wet,
rough work. We have had a breeze in our
teeth ever since we left, but very ﬁne weather.
Omar shed some “ manly tears,” like a great
baby, as he kissed my hand on board ship, and
prayed for me to “ the Preserver.”
