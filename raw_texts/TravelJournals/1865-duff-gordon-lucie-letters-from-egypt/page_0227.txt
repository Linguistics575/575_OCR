216 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

Rebekah; nor would a respectable man go
on his knees like an old fool before the girl
he was asking in marriage for the son of his
master. .

Of all comical things, though, Victor Hugo’s
‘ Orientales’ is the funniest. Elephants at
Smyrna! Why not at Paris and London!
guelle couleur locale! Sheykh Yoosuf had a
good laugh over Hilton’s Rebekah, and the
camels, more like pigs, as to their heads. He
said we must have strange ideas of the books
of Towrat (the Pentateuch) in Europe.

I rejoiceto say that next Wednesday is Bai-
ram, and to-morrow Ramadan “ dies”, Omar
is very thin and yellow and head-achy, and
every one cross. How I wish I were going,
instead of my letter, to see you all; but it is
evident that this heat is the thing that does
me good, if anything will.
