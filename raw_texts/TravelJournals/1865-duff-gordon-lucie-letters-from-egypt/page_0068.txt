gentry in Nubia) gave me a dinner : ﬁrst course, “
baked durah and dates; second, leathery bread
and sour milk; third, durah and dates. Sha-
heen’s two sisters, Rayeh and Khadeegeh, are
very handsome; and his mother touched me
by her anxiety to know “if her son was good.”
They shewed me his two black slaves and his
baby, a very ﬁne one. I presented a baksheesh,
but was loaded with presents in return,—a
lamb, dates, etc.

Today we had a fantasia on horseback; the
jereed-throwing and lance business are beau-
tiful. I think Philm a bit of paradise, and
Aswan is beautiful ; the old burial-ground there
charmed me more than I can express.
