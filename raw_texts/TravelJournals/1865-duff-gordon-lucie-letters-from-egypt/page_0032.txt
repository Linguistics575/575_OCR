ARAB ARCHITECTURE. 21

fends one in the most civilized countries of
thetcontinent. I have been in a poor boys’
school, in the most miserable of workhouses,
and in the huts of a village, and I declare that
they are sweeter far than anything in Europe
of that class, or even higher. The dirt is in
fact dust, not foulness. _

Fn'day.—I went to-day on a donkey to a
mosque in the bazaar of what we call the
“arabesque ” style, like the Alhambra. The
,kibleh was very beautiful; and as I was ad-
miring it, Omar pulled a lemon out of his
breast and smeared it on the porphyry pillar
on one side of the arch, and then entreated me
to lick it. It cures all diseases. The old man
who showed the mosque pulled eagerly at my
arm to make me perform this absurd ceremony,
and I thought I should have been forced to do
it. The base of the pillar was clogged with
lemon-juice.

I then went to the Tombs of the Memlook
Sultans; one of the great ones had the most
beautiful arches and wondrous cupolas, but all
in ruins. There are scores of these noble build-
ings, any one of which is a treasure, falling. to
decay.
