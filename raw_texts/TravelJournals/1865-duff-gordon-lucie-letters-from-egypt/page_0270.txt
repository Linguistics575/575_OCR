THE OOPTIC BISHOP. 259

The hakeem from Kiné has just been here,—

my high opinion of their intelligence. He is

again and give me directions. He was very

unhappy that he could not supply me with
medicines; none are to be bought above Cairo,
except from the hospitalvdoctors, who sell the
medicines of the government, as the Italian at
Asyoot did; but Alec Efendi is too honest for

must send a present “ for the church,”———to be
consumed in arakee. The old man was not

I never will give the Christians drink here;
and now they have left off pressing me to
