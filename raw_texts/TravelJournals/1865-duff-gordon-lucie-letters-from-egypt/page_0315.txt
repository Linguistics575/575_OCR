304 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

corn at sixty piastres the ardebb; (he foresaw
the Coptic tax-gatherer, like a vulture after a
crow ;) now wheat is a hundred and seventy
piastres the ardebb here; and the Fellah has
paid three and a half per cent. per month he-
sides,—reckon the proﬁt! Two men I know
are quite ruined, and have sold all they had.
The cattle disease forced them to borrow at
these ruinous rates, and now, alas! the Nile
is sadly lingering in its rise, and people are
very anxious.

Poor Egypt! or rather, poor Egyptians! Of
course I need not say that there is great im-
providence in those who can be ﬂeeced, as they
are ﬂeeced. Mustafa’s household is a pattern
of muddling hospitality, and Mustafa is gene-
rous and mean by turns. But what chance
have people like these, so utterly ignorant of
all that we call civilization, and so isolated as
‘ the Upper Egyptians, against Europeans of un-
scrupulous character? I now know the Fel-
laheen pretty well, I think. 1 can’t write more
in the wind and dust; I will write again from
Cairo. If you lived in “ constant simoom,”
you would be as lazy.
