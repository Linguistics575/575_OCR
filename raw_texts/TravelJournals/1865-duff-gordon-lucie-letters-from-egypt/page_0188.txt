THE DYING STUDENT. 177

Q

LETTER XXXIII.

Sunday, February 7 ,l 1864.

WE have had our winter pretty sharp for
three weeks, and everybody has had violent
colds and coughs,—the Arabs I mean. I have
been a good deal ailing, but have escaped any
violent cold altogether, and now the ther-
mometer is up to 64°, and it feels very plea-
sant. In the sun it is always very hot, but that
does not prevent the air from being keen, and
chapping lips and noses, and even hands. It
is curious how a temperature which would
be summer in England makes one shiver at
Thebes; El-hamdu—lillah, it is over now!

My poor Sheykh Yoosuf is in great distress
about his brother, also a young sheykh (i. 3.
one learned in theology, and competent to
preach in the mosque). Sheykh Mohammad
