340 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

will leave my furniture, and come down straight
to Alexandria, on route for Europe. I know
all Thebes would sign a round-robin in my
favour, if they only knew how. I will leave
El-Uksur in May, and get to you towards the

The Abab’deh have just been here, and pro-
pose to take me, two months hence, to the M00-
lid of Sheykh Abu-l-Hasan el-Shad’lee (the
coffee saint), in the Desert, three days’ jour-
ney from Edfoo. N 0 English have ever been
there, they think, and all the wild Abab’deh
and Bishareeyeh go with their women and their
camels. It is very tempting, for I sleep very
ill, and my cough is harassing, and perhaps a
change like that might do me good.
