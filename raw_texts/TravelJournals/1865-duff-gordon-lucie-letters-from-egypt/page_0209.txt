193 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

English, is terrible; I don’t know how I learn
at all. ‘

The post is pretty quick up to this place; I
got your letter Within three Week's, you see,
but I get no neWspapersi the post is all on
foot, and can’t carry anything so h‘eaVy. One
of my men of last year, Asgalane‘e, the steers-
man, has just been to see me: he says his
journey was happier laSt year.

We have slain two shakes here, at Several
times. A jackal was caught in the garden,
but let go again by fear and clumsine‘ss. No
one here has the faintest idea bf “ pets.”

The thermometer in the cold antechamher
now is 67°, Where no sun ever comes, and the
blaze Of the Sun is prodigious.
