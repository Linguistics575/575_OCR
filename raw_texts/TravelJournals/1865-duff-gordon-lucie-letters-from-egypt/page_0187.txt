lodging in Cairo, and here I shall live for a
trifle in comfort and save the expense of boat
hire; moreover, the complete quiet would
suit me better than travelling. My dear old
captain of steamer No. 12 will bring me up
coffee and candles, and if I “ sap,” and learn
to talk to the pe0p1e, I shall have plenty of
company.

The cattle disease has not extended above
Minyeh to any great degree, and here there
has not been a case. Food is very good here,
at rather less than half Cairo prices even now;
in summer it will be half that. Mustafa urges
me to stay, and proposes picnics of a few days
over in the tombs, with his hareem, as a di-
version.

I send you a photograph of my two be-
loved lonely palm—trees on the river-bank just
above Philaa. I send you also the seal and
names of Abraham and all the family buried
in the tomb of Machpelah. It is, of course, a
“ hegab ” (talisman).
