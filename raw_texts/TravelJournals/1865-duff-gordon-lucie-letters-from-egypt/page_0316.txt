THE VOYAGE. 305

LETTER XLVI.

' Cairo, October 21, 1864:.

.I RECEIVED your letter yesterday; I hope you
have heard I am better. My illness turned
out to be continued fever, not intermittent,
and ended in congestion of the liver, of course
aggravating the cough; but I am now “ all
right” again, only rather weak. However, I
ride my donkey, and the weather has - sud-
denly become glorious, dry, and cool. (I rather
shiver with the thermometer at 79°; absurd,
is it not? but I got so used- to real heat.)

I“ could not write about my departure from
El-Uksur, or my journey, for our voyage was
quite tempestuous after the ﬁrst three days,
and I fell ill as soon as I was in my house. I
hired a boat for six purses (£18), which had
taken Greeks up to Aswan, selling groceries
