MEDICAL REPORT. 263

only a few have died as yet, and Alee Hakeem
thinks the disease less virulent than in Lower
Egypt. I hope he is right; but the dead
beasts ﬂoat down the river all day long.

Saturday, April 23.

Happily the sickness is going off. I have just
heard Suleyman’s report as follows :-——Hasan
Aboo-Ahmad kisses the Emeereh’s feet, and
the bullets have cleaned his stomach, and he
has said the Fat'hah for the lady. The two
little girls who had diarrhcea are well. The
Christian dyer has vomited his powder, and
wants another. The mother of the Christian
cook who married the priest’s sister has got
dysentery. The Hareem of Mustafa Aboo-
Obeyd has two children with bad eyes. The
Bishop had a quarrel, and scolded and fell
down, and cannot speak or move; I must go
to him. The young deacon’s jaundice is better.
The slave girl of Khursheed Agha is sick, and
Khursheed is sitting at her head, in tears; the
women say I must go to her too. Khursheed
is a ﬁne young Circassian, and very good to his
hareem. .

That is all. Suleyman has nothing on earth.
