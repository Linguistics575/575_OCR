IMPA RTIA L MORALITY. 223

are equal; and, as the men ﬁnd it difﬁcult, they
argue that the women do the same. I have
never heard a woman’s misconduct Spoken of
without a hundred excuses: perhaps her hus-
band had slave-girls; perhaps he was old or
sick, or she did not like him, or she could not
help it ;——violent love comes “ by the visitation
of God,” as our juries say. A poor young
fellow is now in the madhouse of Cairo, owing
to the beauty and sweet tongue of an English
lady, whose servant he was. “ How could he
help it? God sent the calamity.”

If a dancing-girl repents, the most reSpec-
table man may and does marry her, and no one
blames or laughs at him. I believe all this
leads to a good deal of irregularity, but cer-
tainly the feeling is amiable. It is impossible
to conceive how startling it is to a Christian,
to hear the rules of morality applied with per-
fect impartiality to both sexes, and to hear
Arabs who know our manners, say that Euro-
peans are “hard upon their women,” and do
not fear God and conceal their offences. I
asked Omar, who is very correct in his no-
tions, whether, if he saw his brother’s wife do
anything wrong, he would tell her husband.
