CREW OF THE DAHABEEYEE ‘29

“ neat and respectable,” as S— said, in that
costume is a mystery. He is always at work,
always cheerful, but rather silent; in short, the
able seaman, and steady respectable “ hand,”
par excellence. Then we have Ez-Zankalonee,
from near Cairo,——an old fellow of white com-
plexion, and a valuable person; an inexhaus-
tible teller of stories at night and always ‘ en
train ;’ full of jokes, and remarkable for dry
humour, much relished by the crew. I wish

ful, all about Sultans and Efreets, with effec-
tive “ points,” at which all hands exclaim
“ Masha-allah” or“ ah I” (as long as you can
drawl it out). The jokes perhaps I may as

Shereef, who does nothing but laugh and work,
and be obliging; helps Omar with one hand and
“S with the other, and looks like a great
innocent black child. The rest of the dozen
are of various colours, sizes, and ages, some
quite old, but all very quiet and well behaved.

We have had either dead calms or contrary
winds all the time, and the men have worked
very hard at the towing-rope. On Friday I
proclaimed a halt at a village in the afternoon
