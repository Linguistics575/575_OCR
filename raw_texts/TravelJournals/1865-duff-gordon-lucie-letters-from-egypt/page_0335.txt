324 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

perhaps twenty. A youth of fourteen, of Is*
raelitish race, has just gone up, travelling like
a royal prince in one of the Pasha’s steamers,
having all his expenses paid, and crowds of
attendants. “ All that honour to the money
of the Jew !” said an old Fellah to me, with a
tone of scorn. He has turned out his drago-
man, a respectable elderly man who is very
sick, paid him his bare wages, and given him
the muniﬁcent sum of six pounds to take him
back to Cairo. On board his boat he had
a doctor and plenty of servants, and yet he
abandons the man here on Mustafa’s hands!
As I regret whatever tends to strengthen
prejudices, especially religious ones, I am very
sorry anything should occur to make the name
of Yahoodee stink yet more than it does in
the nostrils of the Arabs. I have brought Er-
Basheedee, the sick man, to my house, as poor
Mustafa is already overloaded with strangers.
Mr. Herbert, the painter, went back to Cairo
from Farshoot below Kiné. So I have no
“ Frangee ” society at all; but Sheykh Yoosuf
and Sheykh Ibraheem, the Kadee, dr0p in to
tea very often, and as they are very agreeable
men, I am quite content with my company. '
