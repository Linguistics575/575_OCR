LETTER XIV.

Cairo, March 19, 1863.

AFTER leaving Asyoot, I caught cold. The
worst of going up the Nile is that you must
come down again, and Ô¨Ånd horrid fogs and
cold nights, with sultry days; so I did not
attempt Sakkarah and the Pyramids, but came
a day before my appointed time to Cairo.
Here in the town it is much warmer .and
drier. . . .
