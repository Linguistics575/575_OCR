140 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

She is neither young nor handsome, but he
considered it his duty to provide for her and
the children, and not let her marry a stranger.
So‘ you see that polygamy is not always sensual
indulgence ; and a man may thus practise
greater self-sacriﬁce than by talking sentiment
about deceased wives’sisters. I said, laughing,
to Omar, as we went on, that I did not think
the two wives sounded very comfortable. “ Oh
no! not comfortable at all for the man, but
he take care of the woman; that is what is
proper. That is the good Muslim.”

I shall have the company of a Turkish
Efendi on my voyage,—a Commissioner of In-
land Revenue, in fact,——going to look after the
tax-gatherers in the Saeed. I wonder whe-
ther he will be civil. An Englishman bred at
Constantinople is immensely astonished at the
civility of the Arabs, and at their not abusing
Christians. He says that it is not so at Con-
stantin0ple, where “ unwashed inﬁdel dog ” is
a common salutation. He quite stared at
Omar buttoning my boots. Such a prodigious
condescension from a “ True Believer ” to a
Christian woman! His eating too with my
maid is more than a Turk would do, it seems.
