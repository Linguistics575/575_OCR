 

'DA YBREAK AT PHILE. 277

the beautiful village of the Cataract, and the

noble place of tombs of Aswan. Great was
the amazement of every one at seeing Euro-
peans so out of season; we were like swallows
in January to them. I could not sleep for the
‘ heat in the room, and threw on an abbayeh,
and went and lay on the parapet of the temple.
What a night! what a lovely view! the stars
gave as much light as the moon in Europe,
and all but the Cataract was still as death,
and glowing hot, and the palm-trees were more
graceful and dreamy than ever. Then Omar
woke, and came and sat at my feet, and rubbed
them, and sang a song of a Turkish slave. I
said, “Do not rub my feet, 0 brother! that is
not ﬁt for thee,” (it is below the dignity of a
free Muslim altogether to touch shoes or feet):
but he sang in his song, “The slave of the
Turk may be set free by money, but how shall
one be ransomed who has been paid for by
kind actions and sweet words. 7”

Then the day broke deep crimson, and I
went down and bathed in the Nile, and saw
the girls on the island Opposite in their sum-
mer fashions, consisting of a leathern fringe
round their slender hips,—-divinely graceful!
