ARAB FAMIL Y. .91

interesting family circle. There was a very
respectable elder brother, a confectioner, whose
elder wife was a black woman, a really re-
markable person. She speaks Italian perfectly,
and gave me a great deal of information, and
asked very intelligent questions. She ruled
the house, but as she had no children, he had
married a fair gentle-looking Arab woman,
who had ﬁve children, and all lived in perfect
harmony. Omar’s wife is a ﬁne handsome girl
of his own age, with very good manners, but
close on her lying-in, and looking. fatigued.
She had been outside the door of the close
little court which constituted the house once
since her marriage. I now begin to under-
stand the condition of the women, and the
Muslim sentiments and maxims regarding
them. There is a good deal of chivalry in
some respects, and, in the respectable lower
and middle classes, the result is not so bad.
I suspect that among the rich, few are very
happy, but I don’t know them, or anything of
the Turkish ways. I will go and see the black '
woman again, and hear more; her conversa-
tion was really interesting. I hope to see you
all before very long.
