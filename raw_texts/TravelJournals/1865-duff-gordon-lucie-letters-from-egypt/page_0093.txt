82 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

When the Khamaseen is over, Omar insists
on my going to see the tree and the well
where Sittina Maryam (the Virgin Mary) rest-
ed with Seyyidna Eesa in her arms during the
ﬂight into Egypt. It is venerated by Chris-
tian and Muslim alike, and is a great place
for feasting and holiday-making out of doors,
which the Arabs so dearly love.

It would be delightful to have you at Cairo;
Now 1 have pots and pans, and all things need-
ful for a house but a carpet and a few mat-
tresses, you could camp with me & l’Ambc.
How you would revel in old Masr-el-Kahirah,
peep up at lattice-windows, gape like a “ Gha-
sheem ” (green one) in the bazaar, go wild in
the mosques, laugh at portly Turks and digni-
ﬁed sheykhs on their white donkeys, drink
sherbet in the streets, ride wildly about on
a donkey, peer under black veils at beautiful
eyes, and feel generally intoxicated! I am
quite a good Cicerone now of the glorious old
city. Omar is in rapture at the idea that
“ Seedee—el-kebeer ” (the great Master) might
come. Masha-allah! how our hearts would
be dilated!

It may amuse you to see what impression
