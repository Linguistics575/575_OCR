'108 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

have made a lovely picture. The expression
was sweeter than that of St. Vincent de Paul,
because his smile told that he could have
played with the baby as well as prayed for it.
In this country, one gets to see how much
more beautiful a perfectly natural expression
is than even the ﬁnest mystical expression
given by painters; and it is so refreshing that
no one tries to look pious. The Muslim looks
serious, and often warlike, as he stands at
prayer. The Christian just keeps his every-
day face. When the Muslim gets into a state
of devotional frenzy, he is too much in ear-
nest to think of making a .face; it is quite
tremendous. I don’t think the Copt has any
such ardours. But the scene of this morning
was all the more touching, that no one was
“behaving him or herself” at all. A little
acolyte peeped into the sacramental cup and
swigged off the drop left in it with the most
innocent air, and no one rebuked him, and
the quiet little children ran about in the sanc-
tuary. Up to seven, they are privileged; only
they and the priests and acolytes enter it. It
is a pretty commentary on the words, “ Suffer
little children,” etc.
