60 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

sinners like Mr. Kinglake and me should be
the only people to feel the tie of “ the common
faith ” (vide ‘ Eothen ’). A very pious Scotch
gentleman wondered that I could think of en-
tering a Copt’s house; adding, that they were
the publicans (tax-gatherers) of this coun-
try,—which is true. I felt inclined to men-
tion that better company than he or I had
dined with pu bli cans, and even sinners. The
Copts are evidently the ancient Egyptians,—
the slightly aquiline nose and long eye are
the very same as those in the proﬁles on the
tombs and temples, and also like the very
earliest Byzantine pictures. Du reste, the face
is handsome, but generally sallow and rather
inclined to pufﬁness, and the ﬁgure wants the
grace of the Arabs; nor has any Copt the
thorough-bred distingue’ look of the meanest
man or woman of good Arab blood. Their
feet are the long-toed, ﬂattish foot of the
Egyptian statue, while the Arab foot is clas-
sically perfect, and you could put your hand
under the instep. The beauty of the Ababdeh,
black, naked, and shaggy-haired, is quite mar-
vellous; I never saw such delicate limbs and
features, or such eyes and teeth.
