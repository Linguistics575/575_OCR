THE KHAMASEEN. 81

it easily with a Muslim confederate. Fancy
seeing the pilgrimage!

In a few days I must go down to Alexan-
dria. Thus do Arabs understand competition;
the owner of boats said that so few were

wanted, times were so bad on account of the

railway, etc. etc., that he must have double
what he used to have. In vain Omar argued
that this was not the way to get employment.
Maleysh! (never mind.) Is not that Eastern?
Up the river, where there is no railroad, I
might have it at half that rate. All you have
ever told me as most Spanish in Spain is in
full vigour here; and also I am reminded of
Ireland at every turn. The same causes pro-
duce the same effects. ,

To-day the Khamaseen is blowing, and it is
decidedly hot: the heat is quite unlike that at
the Cape: this is close and gloomy,—no sun-
shine. Altogether the climate is far less bright
than I expected; very inferior to that of the
Cape. Nevertheless I heartily agree to the
Arab saying, “He who has drunk the Nile
water will ever long to drink it again.” S
says all other water after that of the Nile is
like bad small-beer compared to sweet ale.
