238 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

LETTER L.

February 7th, 1865.

WE have delicious weather, and have had all
along. There has been no cold at all this
winter.

I have sought about for shells, and young
Mr. C tells me he has brought me a
few from the Cataract; but of snails, I can
hear no tidings, nor have I ever seen one;
neither can I discover that there are any
shells at all in the Nile mud. At the ﬁrst
Cataract they are found sticking to the rocks.
The people here are very stupid about natu-
ral objects that are of no use to them. As
with French badauds, the small birds are all
sparrows; and Wild ﬂowers there are none,
and only about ﬁve varieties of trees in all
Egypt. The Red Sea shells, I know, are
beautiful.
