70 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

LETTER XIII. '

Asyoot, March 8, 1863.

HERE I found letters telling me of Lord Lans-
downe’s death. Of course I know that his time
was come ; but the thought that I shall never
see his face again,——that all that kindness and
affection is gone out of my life, is a great
blow. No friend could leave such a blank to
me as that old and faithful one, though the
death of younger ones might be more tragic;
but so many things have gone with him into
the grave. Many, indeed, will mourn that kind,
wise, steadfast man. Antigua ﬁdes. No one,
nowadays, will be so noble, with such uncon-
sciousness and simplicity. I have bought two
00ptic turbans to make a black dress out of. I
thought I should like to wear it for him—here,
where “ compliment ” is out of the question.
