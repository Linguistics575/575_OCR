self) has come in for a pipe and coﬂ'ee. He
was Belzoni’s guide, and his eldest child was
born seven days before the French under
Bonaparte marched into El-Uksur. He is su- '
perbly handsome and erect, and very talkative,
but only remembers old times, and takes me
for Madame Belzoni. He is grandfather to
Mohammad, the guard of this house, and great-
great-grandfather to my little Ahmad. His
grandsons have married him to a decent old
woman, to take care of him. He calls me
“ my lady grand-daughter,” and Omar he calls
Mustafa, and~ we salute him as “ Grandfather.”
I wish I could paint him, he is so grand to
look at.

The Simoom has lasted nine days, and is
very trying; the tremendous sweating thins
us all. The glass keeps at 98°, which is very
pleasant with the north wind, but the Simoom
parches one; it is awful,—-so dark and de-
pressing.
