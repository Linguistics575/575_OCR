CONFIDENCE IN THE ENGLISH. 221

to do business with them, and found them al-
ways ‘ dughree ’ (straight); men of one word
and of no circumlocutions, and unlike all the
other Europeans.” The fact is, that few but
decent English come here, I fancy; our scamps
go to the colonies, whereas Egypt is the sink
for all the iniquity of the south of Europe.

A worthy Copt here, one Todoros, took “ a
piece of paper ” for £20, in payment for anti-
quities sold to an Englishman, and after the
Englishman was gone, brought it to me to ask
what sort of paper it was, and how he could get
‘it changed; or was he perhaps to keep it till
the gentleman sent him the money? It was a
circular note, which I had difﬁculty in explain-
ing; but I offered to send it to Cairo to the
bankers, and get it cashed; as to when he would
get the money, I could not say, as they must
wait for an opportunity to send up gold. I told
him to put his name on the back of the note,
and Todoros thought I wanted it as a receipt
for the money, which was yet to come, and was
going cheerfully to write me a receipt for the
£20 he was entrusting to me. Now a Copt is
not at all green where his pocket is concerned ;:
but they will take anything from the English.
