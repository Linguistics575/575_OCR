N0 OR-ALA-NO OR. ‘257

The Bishop tried to make money by hinting
that if I forbade my patients to fast, I might
pay for their indulgences.

One poor peevish little man refused the
chicken broth, and told me that we Euro-
peans had our heaven in this world. Omar
let out a “ Kelb !” (dog !) But I st0pped him,
and said, “ O my brother, God has made the
Christians of England unlike those of Egypt,
and surely will condemn neither of us on that
account; mayest thou ﬁnd a better heaven
hereafter than I now enjoy here!” Omar
.threw his arms round me, and said, “ O thou
.good one! surely our Lord will reward thee
for acting thus with the meekness of a Mus-
limelz, and kissing the hand of him who
strikes thy face. (See how each religion
clai‘ms humility as its peculiar characteristic!)
Suleyman was not pleased at his fellow-
Christian’s display of charity. It does seem
strange that the Copts of the lower class will
not give us the blessing, or thank God for our
health, as the Muslimeen do. Most of my pa-
tients are Christians, and some are very nice
people indeed. ‘

The people have named me Sitti Noon-ala-
