cum; TE 0F THERE'S. 125

* Monday, November 16.

I am much better since I have been in a
dry house. I have bought such a pretty cup-
board for my clothes for seven dollars (45
francs), all painted over like the old Arab
ceilings, in the colours and patterns of an
Indian shawl. They make chests of the same
work for from four to six dollars,—-—very hand-
some and effective, and not ill put together.

Haggee Alee has just been here, and offers
me his tents if I like to go up to Thebes,
and not live in a boat, so that I may not be
dependent on the houses there, in case of any
hitch. I fancy I might be very comfortable
among the tombs of the kings, or in the valley
of Assaseef, with good tents. It is never cold
at all among the hills at Thebes, quite the con-
trary; on the sunny side of the valley, you are
broiled and stunned with heat in January, and
in the shade it is heavenly. I shall rather
like the change from a boat life. to a Bedawee
one, with my own sheep and chickens and
horses about the tent, and a small following of
ragged retainers. Moreover, it will be cheaper.
