TEE SULTAN’S WALTZ. 129

twenty men accompanied him with a respectful
air. How strange it seems to us to go out
into the street, and call on the passers—by to I
grieve with one! ., . \ /

I was at the house of Hekekian Bey the
other day, when he received a parcel from
Constantinople from his former slave, now the
Sultan’s chief eunuch. It contained a very ﬁne
photograph of Shureyk Bey (that is his name),
whose face, though negro, is very intelligent
and of a charming expression; a present of
illustrated English books, and some printed
music composed by the Sultan Abdel-Azeez
himself. 0 temporal 0 mores .' one was a '
waltz! Shureyk Bey was dressed in Euro-
pean clothes too, all but the. tarboosh.

The very ugliest and scrubbiest of street-
dogs has adopted me, like the Irishman who
wrote to Lord Lansdowne that he had selected
him as his patron; and he guards the house,
and follows me in the streets. He is rewarded
with scraps; and S cost me a new tin
mug by letting the dog drink out of the old
one, which is used to scoop the water from the
jar; forgetting that Omar and Zeyneb could not
drink after the poor beast.
