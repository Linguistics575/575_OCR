'162 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

droll: Madame M could not ride on an
Arab saddle, so I lent her mine and enfourchéd
my donkey; and away we went, with men run-
ning before us with mesh’als (ﬁre-baskets on
long poles) and lanterns, and the captain shout-
ing out “ full speed ” and such English phrases
all the way, like a regular old salt as he is.
We got here last night, and this morning
Mustafa Agha and the Nazir came down to con-
duct me up to my palace. I have such a big
rambling house, all over the t0p of the temple
of Khem; how I wish I had you and the chil-
dren to ﬁll it! We had about twenty fellahs
to clean the' dust of three years' accumulation,
and my room looks quite handsome with car-

 

pets and a divan. Mustafa's little girl found
’ her way here when she heard I was come, and
it was so pleasant to have her playing on
the carpet with a doll and some sugar-plums,
and making a feast for Dolly on a saucer, ar-
ranging the sugar-plums Arab fashion; such
a quiet little brown tot, curiously like R ,
with the addition of walnut juice. She was
extremely pleased with R
kissed it. .

The view all round my house is magniﬁcent
