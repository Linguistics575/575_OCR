MAE GIR GIS. 109

I am \more and more annoyed at not being
able to ask questions for myself, as I do not
like to ask through a Muslim, and no Oopts
speak any foreign language, or very, very few.
Omar and Hasan had been at ﬁve this morn-
ing to the tomb of Sittina Zeyneb, one of the
granddaughters of the Prophet, to “ see her ”
(Sunday is her day of reception), and say the
Fat’hah at her tomb.

Yesterday I went to call on pretty Mrs. W.
She is an Armenian, of the Greek faith, and
was gone to pray at the convent of St. George
(Mar Girgis), for the cure of the pains which a
bad rheumatic fever has left in her hands.

Now I have. ﬁlled such a long letter, I hardly
know whether it is worth sending, and whe-
ther you will be amused by my commonplaces
of Eastern life. To-day is Monday, 25th May,
and very hot. I doubt whether I shall stay
more than a fortnight longer here. I am
better as to my cough. I kill a sheep next
Friday, and Omar will cook a stupendous dish
for the poor Fellaheen, who are lying about
the railway-station waiting for work. That is
to be my Beyram, and Omar hopes great bene-
ﬁt for me from the process.
