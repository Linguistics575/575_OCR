it and drives me under cover. The thermo-

weeks, rising sometimes to 67° ; but people in
the boats tell me it is still cold at night on
the river; up here, only a stone’s throw from
the Nile, it is warm all night. I fear the loss
of cattle has suspended irrigation to a fearful
extent, and that the harvests of Lower Egypt
of all kinds will be sadly scanty. The disease

but, of course, cattle will rise in price here
also. Already food is getting dearer here;
meat and bread have risen considerably,—I
should say corn, for no baker exists here 1
