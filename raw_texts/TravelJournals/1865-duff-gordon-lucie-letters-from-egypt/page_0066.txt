satisfaction and pleasure all that relates to
the great source of honour and happiness,
the possession of children. A very handsome
and modest young Nubian woman, wishing to
give me the best present she could, brought a
mat which she had made and which had been
her marriage bed. It was a gift both friendly
and honourable, and as such I received it.

Omar translated her message with equal
modesty and directness. He likewise gave me
a full description of his own marriage. I in-
timated that English people were not accus-
tomed to some words he used, and might be
shocked; upon which he said, “ Of course I
not speak my hareem to English gentleman,
but to good lady, can speak it.”

“ Good bye, dear ” No, that is impro-
per, I must say, “ Oh, my Lord," or “ Father of-
my son! ”
