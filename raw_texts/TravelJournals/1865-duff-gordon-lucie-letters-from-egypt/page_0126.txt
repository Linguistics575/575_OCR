THE MURRALN. 115 w '

there have been as many calamities in his
short reign as during Pharaohâ€™s, and ill-luck
makes a man unpopular. The cattle murrain
is fearful, and is now beginning in Cairo and
Upper Egypt. I hear the loss reckoned at
twelve millions sterling in cattle. The gazelles
in the desert have it too, but not horses, asses,
or goats.

Omar apologized for the stupidity of the
Arabs in thinking that the dearness of all ne-
cessaries was the fault of the government, and
was astonished to hear that many Europeans
. were no wiser.
