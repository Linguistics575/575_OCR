0 ye who go down in the boats to Dunnyat,
Cross, I beseech ye, the stream to Budallah,
Seek my beloved, and beg that she will not
Forget me,—I pray and implore her by Allah!

Fair as two moons is the face of my sweetheart,
And as to her neck and her bosom—Masha-allah!
And unless to my love I am soon reunited,

Death is my portion; I swear it by Allah!

So sings Alee Asleemee, the most débraillé
of my crew, but a charming singer, and a good
fellow; his songs are all amatory, except one
comic one abusing the Sheykh-el—Beled, “ May
the ﬂeas bite him l” 'Horrid imprecation! as
I know to my cost; for, after visiting the Cop-
tic monks at Girgeh, I came home to the boats
with myriads. S . said she felt like Rameses
the Great, so tremendous was the slaughter
of the active enemy.
