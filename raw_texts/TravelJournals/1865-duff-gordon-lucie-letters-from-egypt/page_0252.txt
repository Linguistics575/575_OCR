AMEN T12 241

will it be in J une'! It is now 86° in my shady
room at twelve o’clock, noon; it will be hotter
at tWo or three. But the mornings and even-
ings are delicious. I am shedding my clothes
by .degrees,-—stockings are unbearable’,—I feel
much stronger, too; the horrible feeling of ex-
haustion has left me: I suppose I must have
salamander blood in my body to be made lively
by such heat.

Saturday—This will go by Mr. B and
MLC , the last winter swallows. We went
together yesterday afternoon to the Tombs of
the Kings on the opposite bank; the mountains
were red-hot, and the sun went down into
Amenti all on ﬁre. We met Herr Diimmichen,
the German who is living in the Temple of
Ed-Deyr-el-Bahree, translating inscriptions,
and went down Belzoni’s tomb. Herr Diim-
michen translated a great many things for us
which were very curious, and I think I was
more struck with the beauty of the». drawing
of the ﬁgures than last year. The face of the
goddess of the western shore, Amenti,—Athor
or Hecate,--is ravishing, as she welcomes the
king to her regions; Death was never painted
so lovely. The road is a long and most wild
