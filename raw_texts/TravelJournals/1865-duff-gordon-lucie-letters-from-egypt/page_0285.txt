274 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

Zaghareet (cry of joy). They will walk to
Kuseyr (eight days’ journey with good camels);
babies and all. It is the happiest day of their
lives, they say, when they have scraped money
enough to make the hajj. This minute a poor
man is weeping beside our boat over a pretty
heifer decked with many Hegabs (amulets)
which have not availed against the sickness.
It is heartrending to see the poor beasts and
their unfortunate owners.

Some dancing—girls came to the boat just
now for cigars which A had promised
them, and to ask after their friend El Maghraé
beeyeh, the good dancer at El-Uksur, who, they
said, was very ill. Omar did not know any-
thing about her, and the girls seemed much
distressed; they were both very pretty, one
an Abyssinian. I must leave off to send this
to the post. It will cost a fortune, but you
won’t grudge it. '
