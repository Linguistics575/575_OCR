A BEDA WEE WOMAN. .15

Omar observes; and the children are shocking
to look at from bad food, dirt, and overwork;
- yet the little pot-bellied, blear-eyed wretches
grow up into noble young men and women
under all their difﬁculties. But the faces are
all sad, and rather what the Scotch call dour,
—not méchantes at all, but harsh, like their
voices; all their melody is in walk and ges-
ture. They are as graceful as cats, and the
women have exactly the “ breasts like pome-
granates ” of their poetry.

A tall Bedawee woman came up to us inj
the ﬁeld yesterday, to shake hands and look
at us. She wore a white sackcloth shirt and
veil, and nothing else. She asked Hekekian
a good many questions about me, looked at
my face and hands, but took- no notice of my
rather smart gown which the village women
admired so much, shook hands again with the
air of a princess, wished me health and hap-
piness, and strode off across the graveyard like
a stately ghost. She was on a journey, all
alone; and somehow it was very solemn and
affecting to see her walking away towards
the desert in the setting sun, like Hagar. All
is so scriptural in the country here. .S——--. J
