112 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

LETTER XXII.

Alexandria, Monday, October 19, 1863.

WE had a wretched voyage ;~ good weather,
but such a pétaudiére of a ship. I am com—
petent to describe the horrors of the middle-
passage,——_—hunger, suffocation, dirt, and such
canaille, high and low, on board. The only
gentleman was a poor Moor going to Mecca,
who stowed his wife and family in a spare
boiler on deck. I saw him washing his chil-
dren in the morning. “ Que c’est dégoﬁtant ! ”
exclaimed a French Spectator. If an Oriental
washes, he is a sale cochon. N o wonder! A
delicious man who sat near me on deck, when
the sun came round to our side, growled be-
tween his clenched teeth, “ Voila un tas d’intri-
gants a l’ombre, tandis que le soleil me grille,
mo1.”
