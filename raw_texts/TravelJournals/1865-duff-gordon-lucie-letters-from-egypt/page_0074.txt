he says, “keep the money in our pocket, in-
stead of giving it to. the hotel.”

I hope you got a letter I wrote from Thebes,
telling you that I had dined with the “ blame-
less Ethiopians.” I have seen all the temples in
Nubia and down as far as I have come, and nine
of the tombs of Thebes. Some are wonderfully
beautiful,—-Aboo-Sembel, Kalabsheh, Kom
Omboo,-——a little temple at El-Kab, lovely,—
all three at Thebes; and most of all, Abydus.
Edfoo and Dendarah are the most perfect, Ed-
foo quite perfect, but far less beautiful. But the
most beautiful object my eyes ever saw is the
island of Philae; it gives one quite the super-
natural feeling of Claude’s best landscapes,
only not the least like them. The Arabs say
that Anas-el-Wugood, the most beautiful of
men, built it for his most beautiful beloved,
and there they lived in perfect beauty and
happiness all alone. If the weather had not
been so cold while I was there, I should have
lived in the temple, in a chamber sculptured
with the mystery of Osiris’s burial and resur-
rection. Omar cleaned it out, and meant to
move my things there for a few days, but it was
too cold to sleep in a room without a door.
