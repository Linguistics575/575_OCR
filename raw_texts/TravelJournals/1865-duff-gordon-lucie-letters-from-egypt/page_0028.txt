THE TOOL 00M 17

Finally, a boy is called to carry the battcﬁc
de cuisine, while Omar brandishes a gigantic
kettle which he has picked up, a little bruised,
for four shillings. The boy has a donkey,
which I mount astride, c‘z l’Arabe, while the
boy carries all the copper things on his head.
\Ve are rather a grand procession, and quite
enjoy the fury of the dragomans and other
leeches who hang on the English, at such
independent proceedings; and Omar gets re-
viled for spoiling the trade, by being cook and '
dragoman and all in one. We sail this day
week, and intend to get to the Upper Cataract
as soon as we can, and come leisurely back.

I went this morning with Hekekian Bey to
the two earliest mosques. We were accosted
most politely by some Arab gentlemen, who
pointed out remarkable things, and echoed my
lamentations at the neglect and ruin of such
noble buildings (which Hekekian translated to
them) most heartily. . That of the Tooloon is
exquisite, noble, simple, and what ornament
there is, is the most delicate lacework and em-
bossing in stone and wood. This Arab archi-
tecture is even more lovely than our Gothic.
