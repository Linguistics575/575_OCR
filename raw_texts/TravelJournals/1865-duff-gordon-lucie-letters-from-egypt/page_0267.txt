256 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

wind, and now a strong north wind, quite fresh
and cool; the thermometer was 92° in the
Khamaseen, but it did me no harm. Luckily I
am very well, for I am worked hard, as a strange
epidemic has broken out, and I am the Ha-
keemeh of El—Uksur. The Hakeem Bashi from
Cairo came up and frightened the people, tell-
‘ing them it was catching; and Yoosuf forgot
his religion so far as to beg me not to be all
day in the pe0ple’s huts. But Omar and I
despised the danger, I feeling sure it was
not infectious, and Omar saying, “ Min Allah.”
The people have stoppage of the bowels, and
die in eight days, unless they are physicked.
All who have sent for me in time have reco-
vered; thank God that I can help the poor
souls! It is harvest, and the hard work, and
the Spell of intense heat, and the green corn,
beans, etc. etc., which they eat, bring on the
sickness. Then the COpts are fasting from all
animal food, and full of green beans, and salad,
and green corn. Mustafa tried to persuade
me not to give physio, for fear those who
died should pass for being poisoned; but both
Omar and I thought this only an excuse for
selﬁshness. Omar is an excellent assistant.
