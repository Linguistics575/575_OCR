 

CLIMATE OF N UBIA . 61

LETTER XII.

A few miles below Girgeh, March, 1863.

I AM wonderfully better; the ﬁne air of Nubia
seemed to suit me as well as that of Caledon.
It has the same merits, and the same draw-
back of violent winds. Fancy that meat kept
ten and fourteen days, under a sun which
even I was forced to cover my head before!
In Cairo you must cook your meat in two
days, and in Alexandria as soon as it is killed,
—-and the sun is nothing there. But in Nu-
bia I walked till I wore out my shoes and
roasted my feet, and was as dry as a chip;
in Nubia, and as low down as Kiné, below
Thebes some way; after that it alters, and,
though colder, I perspire again. In Cairo the
winter has been terribly cold and damp, as
the Coptic priest told me yesterday at Girgeh.
