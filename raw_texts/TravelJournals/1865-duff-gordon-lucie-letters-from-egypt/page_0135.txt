124 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

people to dinner. The weather is delicious,
much like what we had at Bournemouth in
the summer; but there is a great deal of sick-
ness, and I fear will be more, from people
burying dead cattle in their premises inside the
town. It costs a hundred guroosh to bury an
ox out of the town. All labour is rendered
scarce too, as well as food dear, and the streets
are not cleaned, and water is hard to get. My
Sakka comes very irregularly, and makes quite
a favour of supplying us with'water. All this
must tell heavily on the poor. Hekekian’s
wife had seventy-four head of cattle on her
farm; now one wretched bullock is left; of
the seven to water the house in Cairo, also one
only is left, and that is expected to die.

I have just been leaning out of the window
to see two Coptic weddings, very gay and pret-
ty, with lots of tapers and mesh’als (cressets).
The bride dressed in white, veiled, and blazing
with diamonds, was led by two men, and pre-
ceded by very pretty music,-—-abyatees, with
harp, sackbut, and dulcimer, singing before her;
and attended by little girls, in scarlet haba—
rahs, as bridesmaids. It is gayer and less
stately than the Muslim wedding.
