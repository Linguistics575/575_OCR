THE WELCOME. 275

LETTER XLII;

El-Uksur, May 15, 1864:.

WE returned to El-Uksur the evening before
last, just after dark. The salute which Omar
ﬁred with your old horse-pistols brought down
a host of people, and there was a chorus of
“El-hamdu-lillah Seilimeh ya Sitt ! ” and such a
kissing of hands, and “ Welcome home to your
place!” and “ We have tasted your absence
and found it bitter ! ” etc. etc.‘ Mustafa came
with letters for me, and Yoosuf, beaming with
smiles; and Mohammad, with new bread made
of new wheat, and Suleymau with ﬂowers, and
little Ahmad rushing in wildly to kiss hands,
When the welcome had subsided, Yoosuf, who
stayed to tea, told me all the cattle were dead.
Mustafa lost thirty-four, and had three left;
and poor farmer Omar lost all—ﬁfty-seven
