ENGLISH DISCIPLINE. 153

LETTER XXXI.

January 5, 1864.

WE left Asyoot this afternoon. The captain
had announced that we should start at ten
o'clock (four, Arab time), so I did not go
into the town, but sent Omar to buy food.
But the men of Darfoor all went off, declaring
that they would stop, and promising to cut off
the captainâ€™s head if he went without them.
Hasan Efendi, the Turk, was furious, and threat-
ened to telegraph his complaints to Cairo if
the boat did not go directly, and the poor cap-
tain was in a sad predicament. He appealed to
me, peaceably sitting on the trunk of a palm-
tree with some poor Fellaheen (of whom more
anon). I uttered the longest sentence I could
compose in Arabic, to the effect that he was
captain, and while on the boat we were all
bound to obey him.
