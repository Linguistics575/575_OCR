MARSEILLES. 111

LETTER XXL:

Marseilles, September, 1863.

I WRITE quite in the dark, as there is a tre-
mendous thunderstorm going on, which I hope
will end the gale of wind. We sail to-morâ€”
row, and only touch at Messina, so I shall not
write again till I arrive at Alexandria. We
are drowned here; what must it be on the
Rhone? Floods seem the order of the day,
even with old Father Nile. I hope Omar will
meet me, and see our luggage through the
custom-house and turbulent hammals at Alex-
andria. It is quite winter here now, though
not very cold, but so damp. I am glad I have
not delayed going back' to Egypt any longer.
