. THE NEIGHBOURS. 83

Cairo makes. I ride along on my valiant don—
key, led by the stalwart Hasan, and attended
by Omar, and constantly say, “ Oh, if our mas-
ter were here, how pleased he would be !"
(Husband is not a correct word). I went
out again to the tombs yesterday. Omar wit-
nessed the destruction of some of the most ex-
quisite buildings; the tombs and mosques of
the Memlook Sultans, which Saeed Pasha used
to divert himself with bombarding, for prac-
tice for his artillery. Omar was then in the
boy-corps. of camel artillery, now disbanded.
Thus the Pasha added the piquancy of sacri-
lege to barbarism.

Our street and our neighbours would divert
you. Opposite lives a Christian dyer, who
must be a seventh brother of the admirable
Barber; he has the same impertinence, loqua-

city, and love of meddling with everybody‘s
‘ business. ' I long to see him thrashed, though
he is a constant comedy. The Arabs next-door,
and the Levantines opposite, are quiet'enough;
but how do they eat all the cucumbers they
buy’ of the man who cries them every morn—
ing as “ fruit gathered by sweet girls in the
garden with the early dew” T
