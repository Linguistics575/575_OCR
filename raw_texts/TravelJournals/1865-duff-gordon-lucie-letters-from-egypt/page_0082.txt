WA SEER 71

I also had so had an account of J that
I have telegraphed .to Alexandria, and shall
go there if she is not much better. If she
is, I shall hold to my plan, and see Benee-

 

Hasan and the Pyramids on my way to Cairo.
I found my kind friend, the Copt Waseef,
who had the letters, kinder than ever. He
went off to telegraph to Alexandria for me,
and showed so much feeling and real kind-
ness, that I was quite touched; it is such a
contrast to the hardness of colonial ways.

I feel very much better; can walk four or
ﬁve miles. All this in spite of really cold
weather, in a boat where nothing shuts with-
in two ﬁngers’ breadth. I long to be back
again with my own pe0ple. Good Waseef
has just been here to see whether I did not
want money, or anything.

March 10.—No telegram, but Waseef has
just sent a letter now come with good news,
so I shall start at once with an easy heart. I
dined and spent the day with Waseef and his
hareem. Such an amiable, kindly household!
I was charmed with their manner to each
other, to the slaves and family. His brother,
as in patriarchal times, waited on us at table.
