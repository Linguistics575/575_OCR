old and rather dilapidated, but magniﬁcent,—
and the lady worthy of her house. A bold-eyed
slave-girl with a baby, put herself forward for
admiration, and was ordered to bring coﬁee,
with cool though polite imperiousness. None
of our great ladies can half crush a rival
in comparison; they do it too coarsely. The
quiet scorn of the beautiful pale-faced, black-
haired Arab was beyond any English powers.
Then it was fun to open the lattice and make
me look out on the “place,” and to Wonder
what the neighbours would say at the sight of
my face and EurOpean hat. She asked about
my children, and blessed them repeatedly, and
took my hand very kindly in doing so, for
fear I should think her envious and fear her
eye, as she is childless.

I shall go to ’3 house; it is Very bad,
but the hotel is Worse, and I may ﬁnd a better
on the spot. I heard of a good house at Boo-
lak for two pounds a month, but I don’t think
that place is healthy with the receding Nile.
I am anxious to get up the river.
