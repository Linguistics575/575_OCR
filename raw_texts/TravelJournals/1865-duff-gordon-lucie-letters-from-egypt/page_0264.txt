THE FAITHFUL SERVANT. 253

He absolutely cried, and kissed my hands, and
declared he was never so happy as with me;
and he could not rest if he thought I had not
all that I wanted. “ I am your memlook, not
your servant; your memlook.” I really do be-
lieve that these people sometimes love their
English masters better than their own pe0ple.
Omar certainly loves Cyril Graham like a very
dear relation, and he certainly has shown the
greatest fondness for me on all occasions.

Suleyman, the COptic gardener, has given
me a little old Captic cross of silver, rude but
pretty, as a charm; I will send it to B
when I have a good chance.

Sheykh Yoosuf is to write my name in Ara-
bic, which I shall get engraved on a signet
at Cairo. It is the only valid signature here.
