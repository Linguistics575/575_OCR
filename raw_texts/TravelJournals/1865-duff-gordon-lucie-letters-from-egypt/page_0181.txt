170 LETTERS FROM EG’ Y PT.

old man, like Father Abraham himself, dressed
in white, sat on a carpet at the foot of the
tomb; he was the head of the family of Abu-l-
Hajjaj. He made me sit by him, and was
extremely polite. Then came the Nazir, the
Kadee, a Turk travelling on government busi-
ness, and a few other gentlemen, who all sat
down round us, after kissing the hand of the
old sheykh. Every one talked; in fact, it was
a soirée in honour of the dead sheykh. A
party of men sat at the further end of the
place, with their faces to the kibleh, and played
on a darabukkeh (sort of small drum stretched
over an earthenware funnel, which gives a pe-
culiar sound), a tambourine without bells, and
little tinkling cymbals(seggal), ﬁtting on thumb
and ﬁnger (crotales), and chanted songs in
honour of Mohammad, and verses from the
Psalms of David. Every now and then, one of .
our party left off talking, and prayed a little or
counted his beads. The old sheykh sent for
coffee and gave me the ﬁrst cup,——a wonder-
ful concession; at last the Nazir proposed a
Fat’hah for me, which the whole group round
me repeated aloud, and then each said to me:
—-—“ Our Lord God bless thee, and give thee.
