I36 LETTERS. FROM EGYPT.

door neighbour, a 00ptic merchant, kept me
awake all night by auditing his accounts with
his clerk. How would you like to chant rows
of ﬁgures? He had just bought lots of cotton,
and I had to get into my door on Monday over
a camel’s back—the street being ﬁlled with
bales.

I have sent a request to the French Consul-
General, M. Tastu, to let me live in the French
house over the temple at Thebes. It is quite
empty, and would be the most comfortable, in-
deed the only comfortable one there. M. Tastu
is the son of the charming poetess of that name,
Whom my mother knew at Paris. '
