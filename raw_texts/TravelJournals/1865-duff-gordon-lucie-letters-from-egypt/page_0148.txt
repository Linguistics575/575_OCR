FURNITURE. 137

LETTER XXVIII.

Cairo, December 17, 1863.

AT last, I shallbe off in a few days. I have
had one delay after another. M. Tastu, the
French Consul, has very kindly lent me the
house at Thebes.

Boats are at a frightful price; nothing
under £35 to Thebes alone. But M. M—-—-,
the agent to Haleem Pasha, is going up the
Nile to -Esneh, and will let me travel in the
steamer which is to tow his dahabeeyeh. ‘ It
will be dirty, but it will cost nothing, and
take me out of this cold weather in ﬁve or
six days. I have brought divans, tables, prayer
carpets, blankets, a cupboard, a lovely old
copper handbasin and ewer, and shall live
in Arab style. The tables and four chairs are
the only concession to European inﬁrmity.
