THE SA U OER 0F OLIVES. 285

had trotted all over the bazaar, and to the
Greek com-dealers, to buy some, but for no
money were they to be had. So he h0ped I
might have some, and that I would forgive the
request, as I of course knew that a man must
beg, or even steal for a woman under these
circumstances. I called Omar, and said, “ I
trust there . are olives for the honourable lia-
reem of Seleem Efendi; they are needed there.”
Omar immediately understood the case, and
exclaimed,-—“ Praise be to God! a few are
left; I was about to stuff the pigeons for din-
ner with them; how lucky I had not done it!”
and then we belaboured Seleem with compli-
ments. “Please God, the child will be for-
tunate to thee!” said I. Omar said, “ Sweeten
my mouth, 0 Efendim, for did I not tell thee
God would give thee good out of this affair,
when thou boughtest her 3” ' While we were
thus rejoicing over the possible little mulatto, I
thought how shocked a white christian gentle-
man of our colonies would be at our conduct.
To make such a fuss about a black girl; he
give her Sixpence! (under the same circum-
stances, I mean,) he'd see her”—etc., and my
heart warmed to the kind old Muslim sinner (2)
