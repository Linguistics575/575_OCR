258 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

Noor. A poor woman, whose only child, a‘
young man, I was happy enough to cure when
dreadfully ill, kissed my feet, and asked by
what name to pray for me. I told her my
name meant “noor” (light, law); but as that
was one of the names of God, I could not use
it. “ Thy name is Noor-ala-Noor,” said a man
who was in the room; that means something
like “ God is upon thy mind,” or “ Light from
the light ;” and “ Noor-ala-Noor" it remains:
a combination of the names of God is quite
proper, like Abdallah, Abd-er-Rahman, etc. etc.

I begged some medicines of a Polish Coun-
tess, who went down the other day. When
all is gone, I don’t know what I shall do. I
am going to try to make castor-oil: I don’t
know how; but I shall try, and Omar fancies
he can manage it. The cattle disease has 'also
broken out desperately up in the Mudeeriat
of Esneh, and we see the dead beasts ﬂoat
down all day; of course, we shall soon have
it here.

Sunday, April 17.
The epidemic seems to be over, but there is
till a great deal of gastric fever, etc., about.
