16 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

called out in the railroad, “ There is Boaz sit-
ting in the cornﬁeld ; ” and so it was; and

Miriam, the prophetess, may have done when
she took a timbrel in her hand and went out
to meet the host.

Wednesday.——My contract was drawn up and
signed by the American Vice-Consul to-day,
and my Reyyis kissed my hand in due form;
after which I went to the bazaar and sat on
many a divan to buy the needful pots and pans.
The transaction lasted an hour. The copper
is so much per oka, the workmanship so much.
Every article is weighed by a sworn weigher, .
and a ticket sent with it. More Arabian
Nights. The shopkeeper compares notes with
me about numerals, and is as much amused as
I. He treats me to coffee and pipes from a
neighbouring shop, while Omar eloquently de-
preciates the goods, and offers half the value.
A waterseller offers a brass cup of water; I
drink, and give the huge sum of twopence,
and he distributes the contents of his skin to
the crowd (there is always a crowd) in my
honour. It seems I have done a pious act.
