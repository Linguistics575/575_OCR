144 LEITERS FROM EGYPT.

English, but very much less dirty than a French
one. All on board are Arabs; captain, en-
gineer, and men. An English Sitt is a novelty
on board, and the captain is unhappy that
things are not (‘1 la France for me. We are
to tow two dahabeeyehs. Only fancy the Queen
ordering all the river steamers up to Windsor!
At Minyeh the Turkish general leaves us, and
we shall have the boat to ourselves; so the
captain has just been down to tell me.

See what a strange combination of people
ﬂoat on old Father Nile: two Englishwomen,
one Levantine (Madame M ), one French-
man, Turks, Arabs, Negroes, CircaSsians, and
men from Darfoor,——all in one party; perhaps
the other boats contain some other strange ele-
ment. There are seven women in the engine
room, among them a Bey’s wife, who wanted
to share my cabin, but our good old captain
would not let her. The Turks are from Con-
stantin0ple, and can’t speak Arabic, and make
faces at- the muddy river-water, which, indeed,
I would rather have ﬁltered.

I must now leave off and go to bed, for I
am tired with my day’s scufﬂe, and with writ-
ing on my knees.
