I am now writing in the kitchen, which is
the coolest place where there is any light at

letters, with a wooden spoon in his hand, and
a cigarette in his mouth; S lying on the
ﬂoor. I won’t describe our costume; it is two

 

months since I have worn gloves or stockings,
and I think you would wonder at the “ F el-
lahah” who “owns you,”-—-so deep a brown are
my face, hands, and feet. One of the sailors
in A ’s boat said, “ See how the sun of the
Arabs loves her; he has kissed her so’hotly
that she can’t go home among her own pe0ple.”

Poor Suleyman’s little boy is dead of small-

 

pox; luckily it has not spread. The fact is,
that vaccination is far more general here than
in Europe; very few neglect it. Suleyman

_ is grievously altered, so pale and thin. He

talked just like a Muslim. “ Allah! Min
Allah! Maktoob. '” (it is written I) You would
not know a Christian here at all by his talk,
or his feelings on religious matters. ,
