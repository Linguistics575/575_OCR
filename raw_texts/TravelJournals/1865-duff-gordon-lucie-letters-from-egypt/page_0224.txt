. MUSLIM THEOLOGY. 213

friends shall dress me in their women’s clothes
andtake me in. I asked whether as a con-
cealment of my religion? and he said no, only
there were hundreds of young men, and it
would be more “ delicate,”—that they should
not stare and talk about my face.

Seleem told me a very pretty grammatical
quibble about “son” and “prOphet” (c‘z propos of
Christ), on a verse in the Gospel depending
on the reduplicative sign ‘“ (sheddeh) over one
letter. He was just as much put out when
I reminded him that the original was written
in Greek, as some of our amateur theologians
are if you say the Bible was not composed
in English. However, I told him that many
Christians in England, Germany, and Ame-
rica, did not believe that Seyyidna Eesa is
God, but only the greatest of pr0phets and
teachers. He at once declared that that was
sufﬁcient; that all such had “ received guid-
ance,” and were not “ among the rejected.”
How could they be, since such Christians
only believed the teaching of Eesa, which was
true, and not the falsiﬁcations of the priests
and bishops (the bishops always “ catch it,”
as schoolboys say)!
