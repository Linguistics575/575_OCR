COPTIC BISHOP. 17 3

100 piastres (about twelve shillings) to the ser-
vants of Abu-l—Hajjaj at the mosque, to pay for
the oil burnt at the tomb, etc. I was not well,
and in bed, but I hear that my gift gave great
satisfaction, and that I was again well prayed
for.

The Coptic bishop came to see me, but he
is a tipsy old monk. He sent for tea, alleging
that he was ill, so I went to see him, and
quickly perceived that his disorder was too
much arakee. He has a very nice black slave,
a Christian, who is a friend of Omar’s, and
sent him a handsome dinner, all ready cooked;
among other things, a chicken stuffed with
green wheat was excellent. Omar constantly
gets dinners sent him,——-bread, some dates, and
cooked fowls or pigeons, and fateereh with
honey, all tied up hot in a cloth. I gave an
old fellow a pill and dose some day’s ago, but
his dura ilia took no notice, and he came for
more and got castor oil. I have ,not seen him
since, but his employer, Fellah Omar, sent me
some delicious butter in return. I think it
shows great intelligence in these people that
none of them, will any longer consult an Arab
hakeem, if they can get a European to physic
