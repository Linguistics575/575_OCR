2'28 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

try; if ‘ Efendeena (Ismael Pasha) comes to
hear it, he may ‘ take a broom and sweep away:

Mustafa joined in at once in\ the request, and
, Said, “ The Sheykh-el—Arab says quite true; it
might cost many lives.” I shall not mention
it to any travellers.

The whole thing distressed me horribly. If
I had not been there, they would have been
beaten right and left, and if I had shown any;
desire to have any one punished, evidently:
they would have half killed the two men.

'Mustafa behaved extremely well; he showed
sense, decision, and more humanity than I at
all expected of him. Pray do not forget my
request about him. It is he who has all the"
trouble and work of the Nile boats, and he is
boundlessly kind and useful to the English,
and a real protection against cheating. Most’
of the English to whom I have spoken are of
the same Opinion.
