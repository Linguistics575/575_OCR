364 LEITERS FROM EGYPT.

hammad feels just the same as John Smith or
Tom Brown would feel in his place, and that
men who were exasperated against the rioters
in the beginning are now in much the same
humour as free-born Britons might be under
similar circumstances.

What is characteristic of this country and
people is, that a thing happening within a few
weeks and within sixty miles already assumes
a legendary character.

According to the p0pular belief the affair
began thus :—A certain Copt had a Muslim
slave-girl, who had read the Koran and who
served him. He wanted her to be his con-
cubine, and she would not, and went to Ah-
mad et-Teiyib, who offered money for her to
her master. He refused it and insisted on his
rights, backed by the government, whereupon
Ahmad proclaimed a revolt, and the peo-
ple, tired of taxes and oppressions, said “ we
will go with thee.” But Ahmad et-Teiyib is
not dead, and where the bullets hit him he
shows little marks like burns. He still sits in
the island, invisible to the Turkish soldiers,
who are still there. This is the only bit of
religious legend connected with the business.
