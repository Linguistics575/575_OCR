76 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

and when I saw the terror-stricken creature
roughly pulled about by his cook and groom,
I said I would take her for the present. She
sings quaint little Kurdufan songs all day. She
had never seen a needle, and in a fortnight
she sews very neatly and quickly. She wails
aloud when Omar tells her she is not my slave.
She is very quiet and gentle, poor little sa-
vage! but blacker than ebony. The utter sla-
vishness of the poor little soul quite upsets
me. She has absolutely no will of her own.

I am quite ready to do whatever is thought
best in the summer. DeIeo Bey can give no
opinion, as he knows little but Egypt, and
thinks England rather like Norway, I fancy.
Only donâ€™t let me be put in a dreadful moun-
tain valley to inhale those dismallest of va-
pours. I hear the drip, drip, drip of Eaux
Bonnes when I am chilly and oppressed in my
sleep.
