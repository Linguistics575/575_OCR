tenderly does. Lady ’s Italian courier de-
spised Omar’s heathenish ignorance in prefer-
ring to stay with me for half the wages he
could have got elsewhere. It quite conﬁrmed

Let me say, by the bye, that I advise nobody
to bring a retinue to this country. Italian
couriers and French cooks are a perfect tor-
ment in Egypt; they hate the country, make
difﬁculties, and ﬁnd fault with everything. A
good English servant, of either sex, gets along
Well; and, next best, a German. The Arabs
like and respect them, but they despise the
southern EurOpeans, Whose faults are an ex-
aggeration of their own, and who are vulgar
into the bargain. Mind, I speak from the Arab
point do we entirely. Also, people who “ make
themselves big ” must expect to pay for it, and
must not be out of humour at the cost.
