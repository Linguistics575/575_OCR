THE VIRGIN’S TREE. 141

S——- is gone with a party of English ser-
vants to the Virgin’s tree, the great picnic frolic
of Cairene Christians, and, indeed, of Muslims
also at some seasons. '

Omar is gone to a Khatmeh (a reading of the
Koran), at Hasan the donkey-boy’s house. I
was asked, but am afraid of the night air. A
good deal of religious celebration goes on now,
the middle of the month of Regeb, six weeks
before Ramadan. I rather dread Ramadan, as
Omar is sure to be faint and ill, and everybody
else cross during the ﬁrst ﬁve days or so; then
their stomachs get into training.

The new passenger-steamers have been pro-
mised ever since the 6th, and will not now go
till after the races, the 6th or 7th of next
month. Fancy, the Cairo races! It is grow-
ing dreadfully cockney here; I must go to
Timbuctoo.

And we are to have a railway to Mecca, and
take return tickets for the Haj—from all parts

, of the world. ’
