THE ARAB PUPIL. ' 349

LETTER LII.

March, 1865.

“ May the whole year be fortunate to thee!”
(The ‘compliments of the season.’)

Now is Bairam, I rejoice to say, and I have
lots of physio to make up for all the stomachs
damaged by Ramadan. I have persuaded the
engineer who was with Lord to take
my dear little pupil, Ahmad Ibn-Mustafa, to
learn the business at Fowler’s engineering
shop at Leeds, instead of idling in his father’s
house here. Mr. Fowler has kindly offered
to take him without a premium. I will give
the child a letter to you, in case he should
go to London. He is a good and intelligent
boy. It is very good-natured of Lord
to take him.
He has been reading the Gospels with me
