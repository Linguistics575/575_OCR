BEAUTY OF EGYPT. 187

LETTER XXXIV.

February 12, 1864:.

WE are in Ramadan now, and Omar really
enjoys a good opportunity of “ making his
sou .” He fasts and washes vigorously, prays
his ﬁve times a day, and goes to mosque
on Fridays and is quite merry over it, and
ready to cook inﬁdels’ dinners with exemplary
good humour. It is a great merit in Muslims
that they are not at all grumpy over their
piety. Weather like that of Paradise has set
in since ﬁve or six days ! I sit on my lofty bal-
cony and drink the sweet northerly breeze,
and look at the glorious mountain Opposite,
and think if only you and the children were
here, it would be “the best 0’ life.” The
beauty of Egypt grows on one, and I think it
far more lovely this year than I did last.
