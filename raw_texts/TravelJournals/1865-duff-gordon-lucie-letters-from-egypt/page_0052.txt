LETTER VII.

Asyoot, December 10, 1862.

I COULD not send a letter from Minyeh, where
we stopped and I saw a sugar manufactory,
and visited a gentlemanly Turk who superin-
tends the district,-iâ€”the Mudeer. I heard a boy
singing a Zikr to a party of Darweeshes in a
mosque, and I think I never heard anything
more beautiful and affecting; ordinary Arab
singing is harsh and? nasal, but it can be won-
derfully moving.

Since we left Minyeh we have suffered
dreadfully from the cold. The chickens died
of it, and the Arabs look blue and pinched.
Of course it is my weather. Never were such
cold or such incessant contrary winds known.
To-day was better, and Wassef, a Copt here,
lent me his superb donkey to go up to a tomb
