I- saw thy riches and thy greatness; and What
has ‘God decreed against thee I” So El-Bef
drawee, who is (or was) one of the wealthiest
men of Lower Egypt, and lived at Tanta, re-
lated how Efendeena (Ismail Pasha) sent for
him to go to Cairo to the citadel, to transact
some business; and how he rode his horse up to
the citadel, and went in, and there the Pasha at
once ordered a kawas to take him down to the
Nile, and on board a common cargo-boat, and
to go with him, and to take him to Feyzoghloo.
Letters were given to the kawés to deliver to
every Mudeer by the way, and another dis:-
patched by land to the governor of Feyzogh~
loo, with orders concerning El-Bedrawee. He
begged leave to see his son once more before
starting, or any of his family. “ N 0, he must
go away at once, and see no one." But luckily
a Fellah, one of his relations, had come after
him to Cairo, and had £700 in his girdle; he
followed El-Bedrawee to the citadel, and saw
him being walked off by the kawas, and fol-—
lowed him to the river, and on board the
boat, and gave him the £700 which he had
in his girdle. The various Mudeers had been
civil to him, and friends in different places
