THE HOLY MAHMAL. 77

LETTER XVI.

Cairo, April 13, 1863.

I HAVE been ill again. ' The fact is that the
spring in Egypt is very trying, and I came
down the river a full month too soon. People
do exaggerate so about the heat. To-day is
the ﬁrst warm day we have had: till now I
have been shivering.

I have been out twice for a drive, and saw
the sacred Camel bearing the Holy Mahmal,
rest for its ﬁrst station outside the town. No
words can describe the departure of the Holy
Mahmal and the pilgrims for Mecca. I sat for
hours in a Bedawee tent in a sort of dream.
It is the most beautiful sight of man and
beast, and colour and movement; and their
ﬁrst encampment is in a glorious spot, among
the domes and minarets of the ruined tombs
of the Memlook Sultans.
