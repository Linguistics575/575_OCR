226 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

' person well known to be so friendly to “El-
Muslimeen.”

When we arrived, we went into a square
inclosure, with a sort of Cloister on one side,
spread with carpets, where we sat, and the
wretched fellows were brought in chains; to
my horror, I found they had been beaten al-
ready. I remonstrated,——“ What if you have
beaten the wrong men '9 ” “ Maleysh, we will
beat the whole village until your purse is
found.” I said to Mustafa, “ This won’t do;
you must stop this.” So Mustafa ordained,
with the concurrence of the Maohn, that the
Sheykh-el-Beled and the “ Geﬁeh,” the keeper
of the ruins, should pay me the value of the
purse. As the peOple of El-Karnak . are very
troublesome in begging and worrying,I thought
*this would be a good lessOn to the said sheykh
to keep better order, and I consented to receive
the money, promising to return it and to give
a napoleon over, if the purse comes back with
its contents (3% napoleons). The Sheykh-el-
Abab’deh harangued the people on their ill
behaviour to “ Hareemat,” and called them
“ Haramee ” (rascals), and was very high and
mighty to the Sheykh-el-Beled.
