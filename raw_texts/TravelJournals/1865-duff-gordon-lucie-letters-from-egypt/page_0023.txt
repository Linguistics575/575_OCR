12 LETTERS FROM EGYPT.

sant to ﬁnd that Hekekian Bey and the Ame-
rican Vice-Consul exactly conﬁrmed all that
Omar had told me about what I must take and
what it would cost; they thought I might per-
fectly trust him. He put everything at just
one-fourth of what the Alexandrian English
told me, and even less. Moreover, he will cook
on board; the kitchen, which is a hole in the
bow where the cook must sit cross-legged,
would be impossible for a woman to crouch
down in. Besides, Omar will avoid everything
unclean, and make the food such as he may
lawfully eat. He is 'a pleasant, cheerful
young fellow, and I think he rather likes the
importance of taking care of me, and showing
that he can do as well as a dragoman at £12
a’month. It is characteristic that he turned
his month’s wages and the “£2 for a coat”
into a bracelet for his little Wife before leav-
ing home. That is the Arab savings-bank.

I dined at Hekekian Bey’s after the excur-
sion yesterday. He is a most kind, friendly
man, and very pleasant and cultivated. He
dresses like an Englishman, speaks English
like ourselves, and is quite like an uncle to me
already.
