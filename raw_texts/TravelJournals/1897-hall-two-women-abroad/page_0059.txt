Near by ﬂows the river spanned by a Moorish bridge of great
length. The stone gate-way of the city makes a splendid back-
ground for the gaily dressed peasants who congregate there, their
donkeys’ heads decked with red and yellow woolen balls and queer
little bells, while awaiting their turn at the gate, where packs are
examined and customs paid.

Across the river are some old mills, with open horseshoe
arches. Oh! if you could hear the cathedral bells, as I did when
I stood on that bridge! They are so sweet, so solemn, that the
very memory of them makes me homesick!

We cannot help remarking the extreme youth of the soldiers
we meet in Spain. We are told that mere boys are being forced
into the army to take the places of the thousands of men who have
gone to Cuba to quell the insurrection. In spite of our disapproval
of the policy of the Spaniards regarding the government of Cuba,
we must admire their courage and determination to die ﬁghting
rather than yield what they ﬁrmly believe to be their rights.
