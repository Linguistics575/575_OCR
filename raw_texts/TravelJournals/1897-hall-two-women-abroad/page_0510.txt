HOJIE H’ARD BO Ug’VD

As I watch her bright face, I remember afresh what a

pleasant time we have had together and how cheery and helpful
she has always been. \Ve are both joyfully anticipating our return
home,—home, the most precious spot on earth, after all!

Your sincere friend,
ADELAIDE.

“ There is a land, of every land the pride,

Beloved by heaven o’er all the world beside;
\Vhere brighter suns dispense serener light,

And milder moons emparadise the night;

A land of beauty, virtue, valor, truth,
Time-tutor’d age, and love-exalted youth:

The wandering mariner, whose eye explores

The wealthiest isles, the most enchanting shores,
Views not a realm so bountiful and fair,

Nor breathes the spirit of a purer air;

In every clime the magnet of his soul,

Touch’d by remembrance, trembles to that pole;
For in this land of heaven’s peculiar grace,

The heritage of nature’s noblest race,

There is a spot of earth supremely blest,

A dearer, sweeter spot than all the rest,

Where man, creation’s tyrant, casts aside

His sword and sceptre, pageantry and pride,
While in his soften’d looks benignly blend

The sire, the son, the husband, brother, friend;
Here woman reigns; the mother, daughter, wife,
Strew with fresh flowers the narrow way of life!
In the clear heaven of her delightful eye,

An angel-guard of loves and graces lie;

Around her knees domestic duties meet,

And ﬁreside pleasures gambol at her feet.

\Nhere shall that land, that spotof earth be found?
Art thou a man ?——a patriot?—-—look around;

0 thou shalt ﬁnd, howe’er thy footsteps roam,
That land thy country, and that spot thy h0me!”*
