I 42 A Til/L‘AFS

To-day we have bidden farewell to the Acropolis, and have
made our last purchases, for, to-morrow, we return to Patras,
whence we shall go to Olympia, my heart's desire, in the Pelopon-
nesus. The more we see of the Greeks, the better we like them,
for they are intellectual, digniﬁed and kind-hearted.

“\Vhere’er we tread, ’tis haunted, holy ground;
No earth of thine is lost in vulgar mould.
But one vast realm of wonder spreads around,
And all the Muse’s tales seem truly told,
Till the sense aches with gazing to behold
The scenes our earliest dreams have dwelt upon:
Each hill and dale, each deepening glen and wold,
Deﬁes the power which crushed thy temples gone:
Age shakes Athena’s tower, but spares gray Marathon.”
