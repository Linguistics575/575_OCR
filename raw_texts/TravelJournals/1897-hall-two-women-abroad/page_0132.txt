I32 ATHEJVS

The third day after our arrival, Dr. C. called for us, and
we went with him to the shops where antiques are sold. Before
we returned to the hotel, he asked us if we would not like to
taste mastir/za, a favorite beverage of the Greeks. On our assenting.
we were conducted to a large café, and soon, two goblets half full of
water were placed be-
fore us, and two small
glasses containing
something which ap-
peared to me like white
varnish and which
smelled about as fra-
grant. This we were
bidden to empty into
the water and drink.
They say mastic/m is
an appetizer, generally
taken before luncheon
or dinner; as for our
enjoyment of it,—one
sip was enough.

Afterwards, we
spent three proﬁtable
hours. in the National
Museum, gazing at
the rare collection of
archaic objects found
by Dr. Schliemann at
the ancient citadels of Mycenae and other cities, in 1876—7. The
rooms containing this special collection are beautifully decorated,
and the articles are in handsome cases. They are principally the
contents of graves, including pottery, household utensils and articles
of personal adornment, such as combs, gold pins shaped like the old—
fashioned safety pin, scarabs,* intagliosxl' buttons, wreaths of gold,
breastplates, anklets and bracelets. There are exquisite gold cups,
