302 VlE-\-’.\’A AND BUDAPEST

men, among the peasants we have seen, wear soft felt hats and
green vests; the women, a square of silk over their heads, knotted
behind the ears, with the ends hanging down.

There are a number of powerful and wealthy religious orders
in Austria. A Benedictine Abbey at Melk is large enough to
house a village. There are 214 windows on the side of the build-
ing, facing the station.

As we approached Vienna, we were almost appalled by its
magnitude. The city is located on a canal, the southern arm of
the Danube, and in a great plain encircled by far away mountains.

PARLIAMENT BUILDINGS, VIENNA

It was once a Celtic colony, but the Romans claimed pos-
session of it from time to time. Marcus Aurelius, called “the
noblest of pagans," died within its walls. The “Compromise"
concluded by Austria and Hungary in 1867 made Budapest the
capital of the eastern half of the empire and, with Vienna, an
alternative residence of the court. Ever since, the reigning sov-
ereign has been designated as the “Emperor of Austria and King
of Hungary."

In driving from the station to the center of the city, we were im-
pressed by the strength of the architecture, the breadth and cleanli-
ness of the streets. and, moreover, by the beauty of-the public
fountains, and the statues that are to be found at almost every turn.
