nia were removed from Aix to Paderborn, in 1794, and, four years
later, to Vienna, where you will remember that we saw them.
The treasury is in a chapel opening out of the octagon, erected
-by Charlemagne between 796 and 804; it is now the central
part of the cathedral. Here are kept the Four Great Relics, i. e.,
the swaddling clothes of the infant Christ; the blood-stained cloth
in which the body of john the Baptist was wrapped; the linen
cloth with which the Saviour was girded on the cross; and the
robe of the Virgin. These are believed by most Roman Catholics
to be the originals. An Irish gentleman, who was among the group
looking at the relics, when we were, informed us that he had seen
all those of importance in the world, and considered these the
most authentic.

The German soldiers wear handsome uniforms, some with
white broadcloth collar and cuffs, which are always spotless. This
is also true in Italy and Austria. On the Continent, even the
street car drivers wear suits of ﬁne cloth, with light-colored trim-
mings. How they keep so free from dust is a mystery, but prob-
ably their neat appearance is largely due to the cleanliness of the
streets.

\Ve had read that in Germany women were hitched with the ox
to the plow, but supposed that such customs belonged to the Mid-
dle Ages. Not so! Yesterday, we were eyewitnesses to just such
a sight; the man guided the plow, and the woman trudged beside
the ox. It is a common thing for the women, like the donkeys,
to. carry huge loads strapped to their backs, and yet Germany
boasts of being an enlightened country.

It seems to us that the Germans have little patience with
people unfamiliar with their ways, and none at all with those who
are unable to speak their language. But, if they are not generally
agreeable. they are upright and energetic, and we respect them for
these qualities.
