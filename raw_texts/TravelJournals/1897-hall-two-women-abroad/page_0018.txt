well as French, so we have decided on the southern route, going
from Gibraltar to Spain; from there, via Italy, to Greece; thence to
Hungary, and home by way of France and England, making short
stops in countries which lie along the route.

Our time limit is to be six months and our funds one thousand
dollars each. I hear you
say “Impossible!" for, in
America, it would cost
twice that sum to travel
almost continuously, for
the same length of time,
but we are determined to
try, and feel conﬁdent
that we shall succeed.

In the ﬁrst place,
though traveling ﬁrst class
by water, we shall take
second or third class tick—
ets on land, shall engage
a modest room, with two
beds, at the native hotels,
and not patronize those
especially arranged to
capture the unwary tour-
ist. Our luncheons and
dinners can be procured
at restaurants wherever
we happen to be at meal time, thus avoiding the loss of time in-
curred in returning to the hotel before ﬁnishing the sight-seeing
planned for the day. As to breakfasts, directly opposite me,
reposing on a chair, is a box containing an alcohol lamp, accom-
panied by a miniature frying-pan for eggs, two spoons, knives and
a tea-steeper.

By prowling about the markets and bakeshops we shall not
only be able to study the various types of people, but also secure
fresh rolls, pats of butter, fruit and eggs.

As to wardrobe, one stout, serviceable suit and steamer cap,
