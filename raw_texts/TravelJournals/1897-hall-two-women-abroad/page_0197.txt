he was rubbed by slaves; he then ﬁnished bya cold plunge in the
frzgz'darz'mn. A gymnasium, library and art gallery were adjuncts
of these baths, which were the rendezvous of fashionable Romans.
who often transacted important business while enjoying their daily
anointing. The 'Farnese Hercules and Bull that we saw in the
museum at Naples were both found in these baths.
