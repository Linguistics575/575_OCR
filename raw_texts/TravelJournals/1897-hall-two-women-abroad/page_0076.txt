their balconies are ﬁlled with ﬂowering plants and their weather-
beaten sides are almost hidden by green moss. In one of the
small parks is a bronze statue of Isabella I., with Columbus kneel-

The moonlight is streaming through our windows; we can hear
the swift ﬂow of the river and the splash of one of its tiny tribu-
taries as it pours through the stone wall of the court below. My
thoughts dwell upon Washington Irving; upon the many happy
months he spent in the Alhambra, upon his legacy to the world.

Granada, where art and architecture have reached such perfection;
where the air blows fresh from the mountain peaks, and crystal
' waters ﬂow from their recesses; where hearts are warm and friendly
toward the stranger; where courtesy and contentment abide.
