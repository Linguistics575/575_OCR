CHAPTER XI
THE IONIAN ISLES

[E morning after we left Brindisi was bright and sunny,
the sea calm and the passengers on the Achille, com-
panionable. We formed the acquaintance of a delight-
ful family. consisting of Professor A., occupying the
chair of Creek at Colgate University, his wife and sister
who were on their way to Athens. About eleven o’clock

the outlines of Mt. San Salvatore, on the island of Corfu,

The Corinthians established a colony at Corfu in 734 B. C..

island of this province that has a perennial stream, the river Mes-

Crossing the square from the bank, we entered the old church
of St. Spiridion, a saint greatly revered by the Greeks. He was
once Bishop of Cyprus, and was persecuted by Diocletian. His
