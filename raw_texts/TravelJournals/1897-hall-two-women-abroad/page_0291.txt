years of age, she had bishops
and nobles for her sitters. and
became so famous as a painter.
that she was admitted to the
Royal Academy of London.
From [769 to 1782, “she was
an annual exhibitor, sending
sometimes as many as seven
pictures. generally classic or al-
legorical subjects." “After this
she produced but little, and in
November, 1807. she died." (at
Rome,) “being honoured by a
splendid funeral under the direc-
tion of Canoya. The entire
Academy of St. Luke, with
numerous ecclesiastics and virtu-
osi, followed her to her tomb in
S. Andrea delle Frate, and, as
at the burial of Raphael, two
of her best pictures were carried
in procession. " “\Vinckelmann
refers to her exceeding popularityz" “She spoke Italian as well as
German," he says; “and she also expressed herself with facility in
French and English,——one result of the last named accomplish-
ment being that she painted all the English visitors to the
Eternal City."

There, also, is Murillo's painting of the “Boys Eating Grapes,”
