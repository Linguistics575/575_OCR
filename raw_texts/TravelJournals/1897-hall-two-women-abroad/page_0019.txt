a black silk gown, a fancy waist and small bonnet for evening
wear, black underclothing (including China silk night robe), two
pairs of stout shoes, a heavy and a light wrap will be sufﬁcient.

The outﬁt can be stowed in two leather-bound telescopes and,
with small bags for toilet articles and necessary medicines, will
constitute our entire baggage. This can be carried with us in
cabs and stowed in the racks of railway carriages, thus saving
expense, for one pays by weight for trunks and chests in foreign
countries.

We shall employ guides only when absolutely necessary, and
shall not present servants with larger fees than the natives give.
By strictly adhering to these principles, the problem of expense
will be solved in part.

I intend to keep a journal and, if you will promise not to be
bored, will send a weekly budget. You shall thus determine
whether we illustrate the old saying of Robbie Burns: “The best
laid schemes 0’ mice an’ men gang aft agley," or whether just
like two women we utterly rout Old notions and prove to the
world that we can plan and execute to the letter.

80, au revoir, ma Cherie! \Vhen next you receive a line from
me it will come from Gibraltar’s rock-bound coast; and now I
seem to hear your voice ﬂoating across the miles that stretch be-
tween us in a fervent “Bon Voyage!"
