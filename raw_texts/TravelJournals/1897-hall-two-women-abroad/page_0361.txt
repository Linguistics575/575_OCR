CHAPTER XXIII
THE RHINE, COLOGNE, AND AIX-LA-CHAPELLE

LILE we were in Mayence, on June 28th, awaiting

the boat to take us down the Rhine, Mrs. M. had

quite an adventure. As I was busy writing to you,

she went out alone to see something of the town.

\Vishing to enter a church, she opened the heavy

outer door and passed into the vestibule, leaving

the door, as usual, to close itself, which it did with

a sharp bang. The vestibule was perfectly dark,

and as she could not see the inner door, she attempted

to open the outer one again, but it refused to yield to her efforts.

Groping her way to the inner one, she found it, also, locked, and

her repeated raps brought no response. The church was not much

frequented, and it was a question whether any one would come to

her relief before the time of evening service, and the boat was to

leave in an hour. After being thoroughly frightened, she discovered,

by the sense of feeling. a knob on the outer door, far above her

head, and, as she pulled upon it with all her might, it moved a
bar below and she was released.

On our way down the river, we suffered somewhat from the
cold, but the scenery was so varied and beautiful that, in spite of
chills, we remained on deck all day. Rugged mountains rose in
the distance, sometimes dark with pine forests; while upon heights
far above the water were ruined castles. At every bend of the
river, towns and villages appeared, some surrounded by fields and
vineyards, others nestling at the foot of cliffs.

The sight of Bingen brought to mind the poem of â€œBingen
on the Rhine." Opposite, on the Niederwald, 740 ft. above the
Rhine, is the colossal monument of Germania, erected by the Ger-

man people in memory of the foundation of the new empire in
361
