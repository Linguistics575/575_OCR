tain Dutch preacher, who was unusually successful in drawing large
congregations of women. He interested them by stating that, in
heaven. they would have bright. new pots and pans, and plenty of
soap and sand to scrub with.

It is a pleasure to buy cooked food at the little shops. for the
counters are so white and clean, the knives scoured so brightly.
I am unable to satisfy my craving for Dutch buns, which are deli-
cately browned and have a spicy ﬂavor never tasted except in this
land of good cooks. I am sure that, when Dutch women go to
heaven, they are kept busy supplying the winged messengers with
these buns, that are so ethereal as to be suitable Angels' Food.

At Rotterdam, two hours more were spent in roaming about
the wharves and walking up and down the broad Boompjes, a
quay laid out like a park with trees, ﬂowers and well kept walks.
Here the Dutch steamers plying between Rotterdam and neighbor-
ing towns, the Rhine and foreign ports, load and unload their
freight.

Standing on the quay and gazing at a ship just putting out,
whose nationality and destination were alike unknown to us, we
thought of the beautiful poem of “The Ship,” by \Vordsworth,
and, if you are not already tired of my quotations. my friend, you
will read it.

“here lies the land to which yon ship must go ?
Festively she puts forth in trim array;

As vigorous as a lark at break of day:

Is she for tropic suns, or polar snow?

\Vhat boots the inquiry? Neither friend nor foe
She cares for; let her travel where she may,
She ﬁnds familiar names, a beaten way

Ever before her, and a wind to blow.

Yet still I ask, what haven is her mark?

And, almost as it was when ships were rare,
(From time to time, like pilgrims, here and there

Crossing the waters) doubt. and something dark,
Of the old sea some reverential fear,

* Is with me at thy farewell, joyous bark!”
