PUBLISHERS’ PREFACE

realize that in introducing to the public “Two

\Vomen Abroadﬂ’ with the expectation of holding

the_reader's interest from beginning to end, we

have undertaken no easy task. The dangers,

discomforts and expense of travel have been so

lessened that thousands of Americans now cross the

ocean in palatial steamers to see for themselves

what was once attainable only thrOugh the medium

of books. The columns of the daily press report cur-

rent events from every part of the globe almost as soon as they

occur. Therefore, to publish a book describing the scenes and

incidents of a six months' tourin foreign lands seems almost
absurd.

But, there are tourists and tourists; among them, hosts of
women travelling singly, in pairs and in parties; some, in search of
health, others, for study, but more, for pleasure.

Another class go abroad because it is considered the proper
thing to do, though they gain little knowledge, and, often, not
much real pleasure.

Again, one with an eye quick to discern and retain the beau-
tiful, with an ear ready to catch the harmonics of Nature and with
power to interpret her varying moods, may in a short time gather
material for several books, the outgrowth of a tour replete with
proﬁt and delight. ,

Such a traveller is the author of “Two \Vomen Abroad,"
Mrs. Herman J. Hall, who in company with Mrs. L. P. Miller visited
Europe last summer. Mrs. Hall is connected with several prom-

inent women’s clubs in Chicago, where she has been President,
