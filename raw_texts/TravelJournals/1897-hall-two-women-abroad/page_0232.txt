CHAPTER XVII
THE RIVIERA AND MILAN

Riviera is a narrow strip of coast stretching from
Spezia, Italy, to Nice, France. It is bounded on the
lOI‘tll by the Apennines and Maritime Alps, while on

he south lies the Mediterranean sea.
About three hours after 1 *aving Florence, we passed

serpents, their tops one tangle of bright-hued ﬂowers—roses, pink
and white, scarlet geraniums and giant clumps of marguerites—

which climb and tumble over the edges.

color of the plaster. a gray or deep cream, in sharp contrast to
the strawberry pink, blue, or yellow of the painted front. The
