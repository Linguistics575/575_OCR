CHAPTER XXIV
THE HAGUE, AMSTERDAM, AND DELFT

:E scenery changed rapidly as, leaving Aix, we entered
Holland. The mountains and dense forests disappeared,
and, in their stead, were marshy meadows intersected
by rivers and canals. The verdure became lighter in
color, and the only objects that broke the line of the
horizon were the sails of windmills, and an occasional
church spire.

whose subterranean labyrinth is visited by thousands, each year.
The stone, a chalky tufa mixed with shells, fossils and bones, has
been deposited by the ocean. It is sawed into blocks, and hardens
on exposure; the excavations date from the time of the Romans.

Holland, like Venus, was born of the sea, for the greater part
of its surface has been recovered from the ocean. The canals, on
which ﬂoat craft used in carrying on trafﬁc, help to drain the land,
the smaller ones marking the border lines of farms. The sea, at
all times, a formidable enemy of the Netherlands, has also been a
protector against. invasion; for the network of canals and ditches

intricacies. Peat bogs cover the greater part of Northern Holland.
The peat, which is a partially decomposed vegetable matter, shows
mosses, heather and even the trunks of pine trees in its composi-

A large part of the country is below the level of the sea, and
its safety depends upon dykes. They are made of mud and sand,
planted either with pines or with ash ' trees, the interlocked and
spreading roots of which form strong foundations. Sometimes, they
