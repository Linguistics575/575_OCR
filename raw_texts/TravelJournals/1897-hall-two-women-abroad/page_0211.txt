CHAPTER XVI
PISA AND FLORENCE

R ﬁrst view of the Leaning Tower at Pisa, on the

thirteen feet out of the perpendicular, it looks substantial enough to

treble the 722 years of its existence. Many theories have been

advanced as'to the causeof this peculiarity. Now, it is generally

believed that one side sunk during the two centuries which elapsed

between the laying of its foundation and its completion. It is said

that the upper stories, of the eight which compose it, were added

remarkable group on the outskirts of the city.

and upheld by columns which rest on the backs of lions. i

Pisa, now six miles from the sea, was once one of the most
important ports in Italy, but, for centuries, the rain falling upon
the barren hill slopes and mixing with the clay has formed a ﬂuid
paste that has silted up the harbor. This disaster might have been
averted, if the Pisans had not lost strength through protracted
struggles with rival cities. At present, it is a quiet town with ﬁne
quays on both banks of the river, and boasts a University men-
