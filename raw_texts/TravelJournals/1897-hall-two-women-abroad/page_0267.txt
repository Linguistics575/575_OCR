Above me, whence thy face

May light my joyous heart to thee its
dwelling-place. ” * :

You think, no doubt, that the blue, moonlight pictures of Venice
are an exaggeration. Let me emphasize the fact that on all clear
nights the sky is a pure ultramarine in color, and that the same
deep blue tints the water and the broad pavement of the Piazza.

“I stood in Venice, on the Bridge of Sighs:
A palace and a prison on each hand:
I saw from out the wave her structures rise
As from the stroke of the enchanter’s wand:
