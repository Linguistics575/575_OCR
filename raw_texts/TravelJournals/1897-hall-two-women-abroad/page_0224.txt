to the grille or cricket. As this is one of the most proliﬁc of in-
sects, it was selected in ancient times to represent the reproduction
of nature, the general awakening in the springtime. Therefore,
on this day, boys walk about the streets of Florence, selling little
wicker cages with live crickets feeding on fresh green leaves.

Armed with crickets, and roses. which are sold for ﬁve cents a
dozen, we proceeded to the Cascine* where the parade was to
take place. A grand stand had been erected on two sides of the
square, and the charge for a good seat x'as only three lire. Every
Florentine who was not in the procession was a spectator. The
mamma with her pretty daughters in their most bewitching cos-

harness, was a mass of carnations, roses and palms. A gigantic
palm leaf attached to the rear seat formed a background for a
lady in white organdie and picture hat. .The front seat, from the
edge to the coachman's box, was a sloping bank of locust blossoms.
The foreign 'diplomates trimmed their carriages with ﬂowers in the
colors of their countries, the American consul's being especially ﬁne,
