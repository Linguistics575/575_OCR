nut trees that leads toward the Jungfrau. On both sides of this
lovers’ lane are broad meadows white with caraway. About a
quarter of a mile from the H6heweg, we entered a village of quaint
chalets. Some of them were veiled by purple wistaria, leaving only
space enough for the diamond-paned .windows to peep out. A
house built in 1745 still looked strong and well preserved; an in-
scription ran across the entire front, the letters being cut into the
wood and blackened. \Ve noticed that the roofs were weighted
with huge stones to prevent the strong winds, which sometimes
sweep the valley, from raising
them. Around the town pump,
with its long stone trough, the
women gather to wash the
family linen, beating and rins-
ing the garments, and chatter-
ing, in the meantime, like mag-
pies. Everything about the
houses had a tidy appearance:
the great wood piles spoke of
comfort during the long winters;
the sleek cows and the fowls in
the barnyards, as well as the
ﬂowering fruit trees, betokened
plenty in the larder. Mothers
were nursing their babies on the
doorsteps, and some little boys,
in funny, green cloth pinafores,
caught together in the back with
a brass hook and chain, were
playing in the road. Follow-
ing a steep path, for a con-
siderable distance, we finally
reached. the Hetel Jungfraublick, situated, as its name implies, so
as to command a fine view of the favorite mountain. \Vhile we
stood there, in the twilight, gazing over the parapet at her beauty,
the young wife (Jungfrau) slowly drew her mantle of ﬂeecy, white
clouds about her and retired from our view into the arms of Night.
