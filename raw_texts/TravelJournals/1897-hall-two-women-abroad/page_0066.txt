which embellish the walls. A charming loggia opens from the Hall

of the Two Sisters. Its ceiling is inlaid with bits of sparkling

overlook a beautiful gar-

The Alhambra Vase.
probably the most noted
in the world, is a splendid
specimen of Moorish ce-
ramic art of the 14th cen-
tury. The proportions of
this ornament are most
harmonious, and enough
of the blue and gold dec—
oration is still visible to
enable one to guess at its
beauty when fresh from
the potter’s hands.

Descending the mar-
ble stairs from the Court
of the Myrtles and trav-
ersing several corridors
we reached the Hall of
Repose, with a raised dais
on two sides, used as a

THE ALHAMBRA VASE resting-place after the
bath. The primary colors. blue, red and yellow, are seen in the
upper decorations, the secondary ones, purple, green and orange, in
the {Indy}; dadoes. A succession of bath-rooms open out of the
Hall of Repose. The ceiling of the vapor bath is pierced w1th
star-shaped openings which admit air and light. The waters of
the river Darro supplied the fountains and baths.

From one of the courts we could see, in an upper story, rooms
opening on a balcony which is entirely inclosed by stout iron bars.
