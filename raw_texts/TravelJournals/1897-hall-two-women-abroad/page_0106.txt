106 THE [UAW/1A!” ISLES

From Corfu we steamed past a number of small islands, nearly
all of them inhabited, and in about three hours reached the island
of Paxos, said to produce the best oil in western Greece.

A legend runs that at the moment when the Saviour's soul

ISLAND OF PONTICONISI. OFF CORFU

left his body, a group of sailors on this island heard a great cry,
“Pan is dead." Pan was the god of Nature, so. Christ's cruci-
ﬁxion. which was followed by the spread of Christianity, meant a
dcathblow to Paganism.

Near Actium, at the entrance to the Ambracian Gulf, was fought
the famous naval battle between Mark Antony and Octavius in
31 B. C. The defeat of Antony was followed by his ﬂight with

Cleopatra, his royal mistress, and their tragic death.
