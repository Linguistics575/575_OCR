ROJIE I 59 -

hides the proportions of the dome from one who is approaching.
Nevertheless, the general effect is astonishingly good, when one
considers how many architects with different ideas had a hand in
the stupendous work. Michael Angelo partially restored the plan
of Bramante, a Lombard architect, who had designed the church
in the form of a Greek
cross* to be surmounted
by a gigantic dome.
After the death of Michael
Angelo in 1564. the nave
was altered by Carlo
.V’Iaderna, so that the
church might assume the
shape of a Latin crossi-
He also added the un-
suitable facade. St.
Peter's was consecrated
by Pope Urban VIII. on
November 18th, 1626.
The cost of the structure
when ﬁnished amounted
to 47.ooo.oooscudi.1 Its
area is 18,000 sq. yds.
There are ﬁve great
doors; the Porta Santa
at the extreme right is
used only at jubilees,
which are supposed to
be celebrated once in
twenty-ﬁve years.
\Vithin the brazen double doors at the end of the great nave,
is a slab of porphyry whereon many of the emperors were crowned.
A short distance from the high altar, is the seated bronze statue
of St. Peter. Our attention was attracted to the lines of worshipers.
