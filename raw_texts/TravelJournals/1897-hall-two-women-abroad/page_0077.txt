 

CHAPTER IX
NAPLES AND THE MEDITERRANEAN

are gliding through a sea of molten glass, broken

here and there with green-clad islands of unutterable

beauty. Before us rises a range of volcanic hills,

the background of the most populous city in Italy,

theinimitable abode of the art-loving, song-loving,

light—hearted Neapolitans. The great golden disk of

the sun is rising from behind Mt. Vesuvius and tinge-

bay is dotted with odd ﬁshing smacks, their bright-colored sails set

to catch the morning breeze. A rowboat ﬁlled with musicians draws

close to the steamer. They are singing a gay lilting song accom-

panied by an accordion, their upturned faces beaming with pleasure
as we toss down some coppers in reward for their welcome.

Prince Bismarck reached his eighty-ﬁrst birthday while we were
on board and we celebrated accordingly. The dining-room at bugle

where, the German, of course, predominating. On every table
was an elaborate centerpiece made of macaroons decorated with
little ﬂags and on the top a candy statuette of Germania. The
bill of fare was elaborate, and after the word “dessert" we read
“transparent ice cream." \Vhen it was_time to serve this course,
