viii PUBLISHERS" PREFACE

for a number of years, of one of the largest Art clubs in the
United States. In her book she has utilized the extensive knowl-
edge of persons and places gained by years of study, and viviﬁed
by her recent journey.

The record of the trip is unique. Dry details are eliminated,
while all that is bright, interesting and humorous stands out in
bold relief.

The pen-pictures are artistically wrought and present in a
natural and charming manner the customs of foreign peoples.

The illustrations are an aid to the appreciation of wonderful
scenery, famous ruins, venerable cathedrals, stately palaces and
the masterpieces of painting and sculpture.

We place this book in the hands of our readers, with the
hope that one reading will stimulate a desire for a second perusal
which will prove even more enjoyable than the ﬁrst.
