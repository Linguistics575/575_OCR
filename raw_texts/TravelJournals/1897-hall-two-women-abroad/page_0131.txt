A THENS I 3 1

said to be more places of worship in this country, in proportion to
its size, than in any other. ‘ The site of a church, chapel or shrine
is always sacred; the name of the saint, to whom it was dedi-
cated, clings to the

spot, even after the

shrine has fallen in-

to ruin, and, on the

saints day, a priest

generally conducts a

service there, while a

lamp or small wood-

en cross reminds the

wayfarer that it was

once a house of God.

' The ordinary priests

are allowed to marry

once, but marriage is

forbidden to the

bishops. If they are

married at the time

of their elevation to

the bishopric, they

are obliged to put

their wives away.

Immorality among

the Greeks is rare,

and as divorces are

only granted on Bible

grounds, they are

comparatively few.

We have noticed (3555" ”'55”

that many of the men carry strings of wooden beads, which they
move back and forth while talking or thinking. Upon inquiry, we
find that they are not rosaries, but supply an occupation for the
hands. \Ve remember the people who twiddle their watch chains
and twirl their thumbs. The introduction of Greek beads into
America would supply a long-felt want.
