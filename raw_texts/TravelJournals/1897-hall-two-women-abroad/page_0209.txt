The royal sorrow of the tears
That dim her sad immortal eyes.

Fair Roma; with her marhles cold,
Her fallen goddesses, and gods,

Her blossoming, historic sods.

And strange traditions. weird and old.

Great Roma; throned eternally
Upon her hills: imperial. high.

Longr miles from that fair azure sky
These. blossoms sweet smile up at me.
