ATIIENS 141

After gathering some wild ﬂowers, we descended to the site
of the old city, at the foot of Mars Hill, where remains of cisterns,
conduits, mosaic ﬂoors and traces of streets and marble thresholds
are to be found. Near Mars Hill is the Hill of the Nymphs. At

PRISON OF SOCRATES

the southeast corner is a spot made smooth by women, who in
past times believed that sliding down its steep incline would cure
sterility.

On the Hill of the Pnyx is the ruin of one of the earliest
structures of Athens, an immense platform 395 ft. long by 212 ft.
wide. Here the people held their political assemblies. The Berna
or orators’ stage was located at the base of a rock, where sockets
cut for supports are still to be seen. The votive tablets, formerly
occupying niches in the supporting wall. are now in the British
Museum. Three doorways cut in the side of the neighboring hill
lead to the so-called prison of Socrates, who is said to have been
confined in this rocky cavern for thirty days, before drinking the
cup of hemlock by which he was condemned to die.

The people still keep up certaincurious old customs, notably
that of carrying their dead through the streets with the face ex-
posed to the rays of the sun.
