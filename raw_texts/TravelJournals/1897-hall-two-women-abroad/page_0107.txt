THE lOz’VlArV 1.91.153 107

The southern point of Leucas is known as Sappho's Leap,
whence the Greek poetess, overcome by unrequited love. is said to
have thrown herself into the sea. . After passing this point. we came
in sight of Ithaca, the island of Odysseus.

At one of the smaller islands a number of horrid-looking Turks
came aboard, and, when I saw their evil faces. I could believe all
the stories of the Armenian atrocities. They slept on the deck,
without extra covering,‘except what Mother Earth had supplied.
Not even the thrilling lines of Byron's Childe Harold, which the
Professor read to us, could overcome my repulsion.
