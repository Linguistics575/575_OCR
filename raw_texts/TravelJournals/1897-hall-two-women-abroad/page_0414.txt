of Napoleon I. and Louis XVIII. Over 12,000,000 francs are
said to have been spent upon this church, which has several times
been the scene of riots and massacres. It is like a Greek temple
in appearance, being without windows. and surrounded by a colon-

suffered little injury, so massive is its construction.
