CHAPTER V

CADIZ

[EN, raising our dizzy heads from the pillow on that
memorable “to-morrow, " we looked through the saloon
windows of the steamer and saw Cadiz in the dis-
tance, we felt like lost souls that had been in Purga—
tory and now wandering in Hades, could catch afar
off a glimpse of Paradise.
_ On coming down to the quay at Tangier, to
take the boat for the above celestial city, we observed
a blue ﬂag ﬂoating conspicuously from a building near
the water. This, we were informed, meant a high sea, and conse-
quently double tariff to the steamer. Imagine our dismay when,
upon reaching the edge of the landing, we found several brawny
natives knee deep in the water, with arms outstretched to receive
and hear us to the small boats about twenty feet away. They
grabbed us as if we were bags of meal, and over their shoulders we
went and were lugged to the boats and dumped in. But that was
a mere bagatelle to the ride which followed. How the boat tossed
on that awful sea! now rising to the very crest of a wave, moun-
tain high, then engulfed in a green abyss.

When near the steamer we were compelled to literally empty
our pocketbooks by the pirate-like Moors, each in turn demanding
a peseta, besides the double tariff. We dared not refuse, and the
only other passengers in our boat, a party of Germans among whom
were three men apparently endowed with average mental and phys-
ical powers, did not offer the slightest resistance. Nevertheless.
the deck of the Joaquin Piélago was finally reached and we were
minus only a silk umbrella, belonging to my companion, which had
sought the briny depths.
