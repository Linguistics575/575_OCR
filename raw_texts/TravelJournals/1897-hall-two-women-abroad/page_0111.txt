formerly the lair of the dragon, Pytho, slain by Apollo. The Romans
looted the temple many times, Nero alone carrying off more than

Nero. who even began the work. The present canal was begun
by a French company, who, in 1889, left it to be completed by the
Greeks. There are two breakwaters, each 785 ft. long, and two
lighthouses to protect the western entrance. The channel is 100 ft.
wide three and a half miles long and twenty- -six feet deep; for a
distance of one mile it is cut through solid rock.

“Fair Greece, sad relic of departed worth,
Immortal, though no more, though fallen, great.”

There, outlined against the blue of heaven stood the Acropolis,*
for centuries the mighty throne of that perfect work of man's chisel
and compass, —the Parthenon. We involuntarily offered our homage
to the man to whose wisdom and perseverance the world owes this
treasure—the statesman, Pericles. '
