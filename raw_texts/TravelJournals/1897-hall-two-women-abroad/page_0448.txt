CHAPTER XXVII
MONT ST. MICHEL, GRANVILLE, AND JERSEY

.RLY on the morning of July 22nd, we bade good-bye
to Paris with mingled feelings of regret and relief; re-

our short visit; relief, because we were going away
from the dust and heat, through the green country to
the coast. Normandy is a delightful district of France,

and our route lay through woods and rich farm lands,

inns. At last, we gave our baggage to a man who seemed more
modest than the others, and told him to lead the way. His hos-
