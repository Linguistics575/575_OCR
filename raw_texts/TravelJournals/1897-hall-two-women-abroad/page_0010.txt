L'VTROD UCT/OA" x

Old \Vorld. The Present is, in great measure, the disciple of the
Past, and only by travel can we learn to estimate, justly, the
mature civilization of Europe. The knowledge thus gained is one
of the chief elements of culture. But travel is not possible to all;
many must rely upon sources of information, more or less indirect.

Reproductions of famous works of art have a distinct educa-
tional value. Therefore, this story of a summer's wanderings is
embellished with many ﬁne illustrations carefully selected by my
companion.

The historical references and other data are based upon the
best authorities, and in a general way the book may serve as a
guide to prospective tourists. Familiar foreign names are used.
but those occurring less frequently are translated into English or
explained in footnotes.

If the beneﬁts received, and the delight experienced during
the journey described and illustrated in this work are shared, even
in a small degree, by my readers; I shall feel more than repaid
for my efforts.
