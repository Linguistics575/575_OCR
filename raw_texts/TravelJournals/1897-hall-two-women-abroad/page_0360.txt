360 NUREJIBERG AA?!) THE BLACK FOREST

Is a merry meal for him.
Creeping where no life is seen
A rare old plant is the Ivy green.

“Whole ages have ﬂed, and their works de-
cayed,
And nations scattered been;
But the stout old Ivy shall never fade
From its hale and hearty green.
The brave old plant in its lonely
days
Shall fatten upon the past;
For the stateliest building man can
raise
Is the Iv‘y’s food at last.
Creeping where no life is seen
A rare old plant is the Ivy green.”*
