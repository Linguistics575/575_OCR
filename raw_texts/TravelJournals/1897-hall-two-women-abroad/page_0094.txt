CHAPTER X
FROM CAPRI TO BRINDISI

[E Bay of Naples was never more enchanting than
when we embarked for Capri. Behind us lay the varied
landscape, before us the iridescent waters, reﬂecting a
cloudless sky, while the coast to the southward was
broken into curves by the harbors of the fishing towns.
Past Castellamare. Vico Equense and Sorrento we
steamed and, in less than three hours, dropped anchor
at Capri, “Bluest of the Isles. " Her turreted rocks and smiling
vales are girdled by a sea so intense in color that it seems as if
some one had emptied into it tons of indigo. The ancient villas of
Augustus and Tiberius. and the medizeval castle of Barbarossa are
scarcely to ,be distinguished from the crags on which they were
built, so completely have they fallen into decay.

The town of Capri lies between the two highest points of the
island, L0 Capo and Mt. Solaro. A winding road, hewn in the
rock and as smooth as a marble ﬂoor, leads up to the white dwell-
ings of Anacapri on a small plateau, 420 ft. above. Steps cut in
the side of the cliffs were formerly the only means of access to
the upper village. _

Upon arriving at the principal landing-place, we found that the
porters from the different hotels were women, who shouldered the
baggage of the passengers, even large trunks, with the ease of
strong men. The feminine portion of the community does much
of the heavy work, including the coaling of vessels. The physique
Of these women is magniﬁcent.

Most of the streets are mere paths, which are very steep, and
Often ascend in steps. They are about wide enough to allow three
People to walk abreast, and run between high walls, inclosing
Vineyards and groves of lemon and orange trees. , Rills of water
