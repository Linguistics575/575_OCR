were buried together. It took three days to clear the ﬁeld of the
dead, of whom it is estimated that there were 50,000.

Various ofﬁcers made requests as to the naming of the battle,
but they differed from one another, each wishing it to be named
from the quarter where he had been engaged. The Duke, there-
fore, thought best to avoid bad feeling by naming it after the
village of Waterloo, where his headquarters were located, three
miles from the field.

Thus ended this decisive battle, in which three on'ld-renowned
commanders had taken part. Napoleon's iron will was broken.
Later, he was exiled, and died at St. Helena, May 5th, 1821.

Leopold II., the present king of the Belgians, was crowned,
December 10th, 1865. Though he is deemed penurious, and lack-
ing in some agreeable qualities, Belgium has certain y prospered
amazingly during his reign. Queen Henriette Marie, a slender,
active woman, is much respected by her subjects. Like all the
rest of the world, this royal pair have had their trials, not the
least of them being the demented condition of the ex-Empress
Charlotte of Mexico, widow of Maximilian, and the King's sister.

The more we see of Brussels, the more favorably we are im—
pressed by it. It seems a city of fine residences rather than a
commercial center. The working people are examples of courtesy
and hospitality, and an air of court elegance pervades the entire
metropolis.

“ Truth-teller was our England’s Alfred named;
Truth-lover was our English Duke.
Whatever record leap to light
He never shall be shamed.” *
