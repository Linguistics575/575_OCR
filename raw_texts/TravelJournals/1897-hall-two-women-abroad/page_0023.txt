CHAPTER III

GIBRALTAR

BRALTAR is before us! It looks like a great lion crouch—
ing in readiness for a spring. The sky is a celestial
blue, the air is balmy, and with Spain's rugged coast on
one side and the low-lying hills of Africa on the other
we feel that we are indeed approaching foreign shores on
the bosom of strange waters.

Gibraltar has been an English fortress since 1704,
when it was captured during the war of the Spanish succession by
Sir George Rooke. Persistent efforts have been made by the Span-
ish and French to wrest from the aliens this key to the Mediter-
ranean and the East, but the Union Jack still ﬂoats from the pin-
nacle of the stronghold twelve hundred feet above the sea. Gib-
raltar is a natural fortress. On one side the sheer wall of the cliff
forms an impregnable defense and on the other is a network of
batteries. Galleries wide enough for a carriage to pass are cut in
the solid rock, and the black muzzles of cannon project through the
portholes. The summit is crowned by a gun having a range of ﬁve
miles, and an electric connection makes it possible to aim and ﬁre
thegun from a station below.

Geologically, the rock is very curious. The lower strata are
gray limestone and the upper striped with pale bluish shales,*
while shells are found fully four hundred and ﬁfty feet above the
present sea level. As is not uncommon in limestone formations,
there are many passages and caves, the most noted being St.
Michael’s Cave, where the central hall is ﬁfty feet high and hung
with magniﬁcent stalactites. At the foot of the rock lies the town,
with a population 'of about 24,000.
