The empty tomb of St. Cecilia was hung with wreaths brought
by several young girls, who had received their ﬁrst communion in
front of it, the day before. The saint's body was removed in 1821
to the church erected in her honor, where, beneath the high altar.
is her marble statue by Madema. She is represented lying upon
her side; with her knees drawn up, as her body was found in that
position in the catacombs. Legend relates that she was a Roman

that Cecilia sang the praises of
the Lord to the accompaniment
of musical instruments and,
ever since, has been p'atroness

the heart of the English poet, Shelley, is buried; his body was
cremated on the shores of the Bay of Spezia. In the adjoining
burying ground lies john Keats, whose grave is hidden by ivy and
