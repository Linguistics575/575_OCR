Yesterday was the birthday of a German lady who sits at
our table and is so jolly that she is a general favorite. She was
surprised at dinner when a ﬁne cake, with her name wrought in

sent a generous slice to the commander. Accompanied by her
witty remarks, the act caused a good deal of merriment.

our ﬁrst view of the rock.
