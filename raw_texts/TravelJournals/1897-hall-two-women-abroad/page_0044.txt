stalls were kept perfectly dark, so that, when the animals rushed
forth into the bright sunlight. after twenty-four hours of fasting, they
would be more ferocious
than ever. The cost of
each group of bulls is
about two thousand dol-
lars, and the owner furn-
ishes forty horses; gener-
ally, worthless creatures.
If the bulls prove very
active and the supply of
horses be insufÔ¨Åcient,
others must be procured
at once, and, if necessary,
taken from the carriages
near by. Their sufferings
are often very great, for,
when the bull only suc-
ceeds in inflicting a gash
in their sides. it is sewed
up and they are sent
again into the arena to
meet a worse. or shall
we say a more merciful,
fate in death.

There are three sets
of men in the ring. First. the Picadores, who wear broad-brimmed
hats, and, with legs incased in leather and iron, sit upon their
horses at the entrance to the arena, and attract the attention of
the bull as he rushes in. They carry a/bz'ro or short spear, to ward
off violent attacks; they are subject to many hairbreadth escapes.
Next come the Banderilleros, who take greater risks than the Pica-
dores. Their part in this brutal sport is to launch darts, decorated
with long streamers, at the shoulders of the bull, thus increasing
his rage. Just above the tips of these darts are fastened torpedoes,
which explode when striking the flesh, making the tortured creature
bound into the air. A clever Banclerillero will sometimes sit in a
