architect, musician and painter and was, withal, such a thorough stu-
dent that the manuscripts which he left to the world have been used
as text-books, ever since. Handsome in person and agreeable in

The most celebrated work of art in Milan is his picture of the
“Last Supper, ” painted in oils on the end wall of the refectory
in the monastery of Santa Maria delle .Grazie. If he had only
employed the reliable method of fresco, we might still have this
wondrous creation intact, but time and dampness have combined
to destroy it. There is a wonderful majesty about the ﬁgure of
the Saviour, indistinct as it is. To my mind, divinity is more
nearly portrayed in this face than in any other representation. The
artist has depicted the moment when Jesus has just uttered the words,
“One of you shall betray me!" The guilt in the face of Judas
and the consternation of the other disciples only make more im-
pressive and solemn the resignation and suffering in the features

of Tasso, Galileo and the Medici.

One of the ﬁnest monuments in the city is that erected to
the memory of Cavour, the regenerator of Italy, a statesman, the
very mention of whose name kindles the patriotic spark in every
Italian breast.

I have only given you a hint of the treasures of Milan, but
time passes and we must away. We are going to leave our bag-
gage, with the exception of a hand satchel, in the hotel here,
until we return from Venice. We leave early to—morrow, by a
slow train (third-class), and hope thus to see something of the
country and the peasants along the route.
