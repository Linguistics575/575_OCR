NUREJ/BERG AN!) THE BLACK FOREST 345

A ﬁne statue of Dtirer stands in the square named for him,
near his home, now the property of the city. The rooms are just
as he left them, with curious old furniture. In the kitchen. the
stove stands upon a large brick platform; the wood is heaped on
top, under a great iron pot, which is placed on a frame. Near by,
is a huge water-bucket,
small at the bottom and
large at the top, with
leathern thongs by which
to carry it, on the back,
to and from the pump;
just such buckets are
still in use.

Attached to the 14th
century Chapel of St.
Moritz, like a piece of
moss to the trunk of a
tree, is a tiny restaurant
with a bell on one side,
the Bratwurst-Clock-
lein,* where Albrecht
Dtirer, Adam KraHt,
Peter Vischer, and Hans
Sachs, the poet, used to
meet their friends, and,
together, have a plate of
Bralrtmrst. A delicious
sauerkraut is served with
this sausage peculiar to Nuremberg—the crispest, daintiest morsel
that it was ever the privilege of a hungry wayfarer to taste. It
was great fun to watch the sausages sputtering and sizzling over
the embers in the diminutive kitchen. A dish of Bra/a'ztrsr, and
two fresh rolls cost only nine cents, and I am afraid we were care-
less of our digestion while in Nuremberg.
