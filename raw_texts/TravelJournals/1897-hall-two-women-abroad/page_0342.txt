CHAPTER XXII
NUREMBERG AND THE BLACK FOREST

all the quaint places that it has been my good

ortune to see, Nuremberg takes the precedence. The .

vide ramparts and strong towers were once protected

)y a moat ﬁlled with black water, but, now, grass-

;)wn and dotted with trees. The river Pegnitz ﬂows

.gh the old part of the city, dividing it almost

equally. It is crossed by queer bridges. that add one

more touch to the general picturesqueness of the town, all towers
and turrets, dormer windows and red, gabled roofs.

It seemed incongruous to take a carriage to the hotel, and the
sight of a street car positively hurt our feelings, so we gave our
baggage to a stout porter and walked under the tower gateway,
and over the bridge across the moat. The main street is irregular
and narrow, and the hotel that we selected was once the resi-
dence of a ﬁne family. How we enjoyed the frescoes on the walls
of our room, the great, carved bed and the ornaments on the high
chimneypiece! It was like a chapter out of an old story-book!

In the quarter of St. Sebald is a Gothic church of the same
name. The "Schreyer Monument" in relief, on one side, and the
representation of the “Last Judgment," over the south entrance,
are world-renowned examples of stone cutting. They are the work
of Adam Krafft, a Nuremberg stone cutter, and were executed in
the 15th century. .

\Vithin the church, is the bronze monument of St. Sebald,
weighing eight tons, the masterpiece of Peter Vischer, who, with
his ﬁve sons, worked upon it for thirteen years, introducing into
the design small ﬁgures of the twelve apostles, besides prophets
and the fathers of the church.

The greatest artist of Nuremberg was Albrecht Durer (I471-
