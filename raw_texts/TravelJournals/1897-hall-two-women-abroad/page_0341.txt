was arranged in wide, ﬂat braids, and brought about her head,
from the nape of the neck to a peak in front, in the exact form
of the Russian headdress. She was so vivacious and sparkling as

a dance, and it was amusing to see the complacency of her chaper-

there was one set where the couples formed in two rows down the
hall, after the fashion of the old contra-dances.

\Ve have not seen a single peasant, in Bohemia, wearing the
entire, national costume; only. now and then, a bright-colored dress,
and handkerchief over the head. Slowly but surely, the picturesque
costumes are, everywhere, giving way to the ugly, mutton-leg sleeve,
and gored skirt of the present day. It is a pity, for the peasant
girl is often very attractive in the simple dress suited to her face
and ﬁgure, and very commonplace when she apes the lady of
fashion.
