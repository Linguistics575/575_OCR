scarlet liveries, twice the ﬁrst evening we were on the Pincian.
Since the time of the attempt upon the King's life. several years
ago, the sovereigns have not driven together. The King is a
handsome man of large frame, though not very tall, and has
piercing eyes, snow-white hair and heavy, long mustaches curled
up at the corners.
He is always ac-
companied by an
ofﬁcer of his house—
hold, and, wher-
ever he goes, is
greeted with
cheers and un-
covered heads.
These salutations
he returns in the
most cordial man-
ner. It is beauti-
ful to see the
Queen when she
passes the King
on the afternoon
drive. As the
equipage of the
King approaches,
Margherita rises
from her seat
slowly and stead-
ily and gravely
bends her grace-
ful form, and
then, as slowly,
resumes her place.
They are said to detest pomp and display of any kind; both are
industrious and charitable, and, above all, devoted to each other.
The hour before dinner they spend together, and whoever happens
to come then, on business or pleasure, to see the King, must wait.

MARGHERITA, QUEEN OF ITALY
