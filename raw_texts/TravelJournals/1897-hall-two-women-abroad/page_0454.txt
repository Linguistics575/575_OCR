eating their evening meal of porridge, the women wearing a pic-
turesque headdress of white linen.

”The following morning, we imbarked for the island of Jersey,
reaching St. Heliers in the afternoon. Walking about the princi-
pal squares, we saw the statue of Queen Victoria, and visited a
number of shops. The display of metal work is very ﬁne, and old

Norman designs are copied in
bric-a-brac and jewelry. There
is a fort at St. Heliers, and
one sees nearly as many British
soldiers on the street as at Gi-
braltar. The island is indented
by bays, the coast terminating
in high rocks. \Ve longed to
stay and wander about the old
castle of Mont Orgueil and take
a trip to the Corbiere light-
house, but we were compelled
‘ to take the boat the next morn-
CORBIERE LIGHTHOUSE ing for POI'tSmOUth.

Although the Channel Islands are productive, the chief export
of Jersey and Guernsey is cattle. The breed of Jersey is that
Commonly known as Alderney, kept pure by stringent laws against
the importation of foreign animals. While at St. Peter-le-Port,
Guernsey, the boat took on ﬁve Guernsey cows, a breed larger
than the Alderney. They were tan colored, with big, white
blot-ches, and great, soft eyes. Here also 4,000 baskets of to-
matoes were loaded for the London markets.

The Needles were a ﬁne sight, springing up from the water
like marble monuments to shipwrecked mariners.

In the harbor at Cowes there were many ﬁne yachts. The
Queen is expected at Osborne in a couple of days. Yesterday the
Princess Maud of \Vales was married to Prince Charles of Den-
mark, and we learn that the elite of England are still in London,
and that the hotels are crowded. However, we shall not borrow
trouble, as we have not yet failed to ﬁnd a place to lay our
heads.
