' A NILE JOURNAL. 7 I

Egyptians, and mystery ﬂoated to us from
the far tombs of Medinet Haboo on the
twilight, while glistening Nilus, darkening
in his banks, counted his ﬂocks of birds
in chaplets, as beadsmen do their beads.
And calm fell upon us out of heaven, and
we were at peace.

We divided our work into alternate days
on either side of the river, and so the
second day we visited the Colossi. We
had to take donkeys twice, crossing a
little arm of the Nile in a stupendous boat,
consisting of irregular chunks of unpainted
wood, and the oars crooked tree-boughs.
And our ghostly, tattered oarsman might
well have been the original Egyptian
Charon taking us to the Elysian ﬁelds
and the dead of old. It is still the constant
custom here for the dead to cross the Nile
and be buried at home, and the old Egypt-
ians always carried a corpse over an arti-
ﬁcial lake, called the Lake of the Dead;
and through these legends Charon ﬁrst came
from Greece to Italy.
