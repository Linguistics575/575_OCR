signiﬁcance, look like a hornet’s nest, a
small tomb about twenty-ﬁve feet by
ﬁfteen was discovered last year. On the
inside, over the door, is written “Opened
February 16th, 1874, by A. M.” Ap-
parently some graceless Wight has obliter-
ated the word Mariette. It is a poor
return for M. Mariette’s devotion and toil;
his name by every traveller should be
exalted as his best friend, and not defaced.

It is now well known that the temples
were but the expression of a conqueror’s
exultation through ceremonials which were
only shared in by those of the royal family,
the priesthood, and perhaps his leading
ofﬁcers. By them the sacred inner mean-
ing of their ‘rites was monopolised—the
pe0ple did not share it. It is in the tombs
that we are to look, as with the Etruscans,
for those details of daily life which for us
revive the past. Not only this conserva-
tive climate, but the habit of accurate
drawing make these tomb-pictures clearer
than could be words to bring us near them.
