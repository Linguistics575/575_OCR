A NILE JOURNAL. 87

plain, stands the tomb of a sheikh; it
‘ looks precisely like Sinbad’s roc’s egg, and
reminds us of Vedder’s picture, where so
well he has painted it. Here these tombs, .
as we pass away from the more populous
places of the Nile towards the savageness
of Nubia, are less and less frequent.

But we have been for several days in
the country of the sakia and the shadoof.
There, in the blazing sun, stands at
the shadoof a streaming ﬁgure of Floren-
tine bronze, as if doomed to labour in vain
for sins he had committed. He is Egypt’s
image of Tantalus, and too sadly he
resembles it. The fertility he furnishes
shall pass by his own' lips, and he stands
silent there, robbed of the wealth he creates.
He indeed is silent, but his shadoof and
sakia moan for him. Their grief, a creak,
heard like a refrain of sorrow amid the joy
of the sunshine, laments for him. It is the
same cry of burthen and over-work that
we hear in the voice of the camel, which at
times it strangely resembles.
