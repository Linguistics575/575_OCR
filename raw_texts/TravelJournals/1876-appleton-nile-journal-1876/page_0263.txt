In the evening I took my gun and Arab,
and wandered far along the shore in vague
hope of sand-grouse or foxes. I got only
a distant shot at a hawk, and came back
by one of those sunsets which, after the
'blank lustre of Nubia, seems homelike.
Here there are clouds and softness and
endless lines of distance. The hum of the
sakia is dead, and no more shall we see
the lovely Nubian maiden—for we did
really ﬁnd her at last, with her gazelle-like
timidity, her oily tresses, and her beautiful
sky-blue lips.

The enchanter who turns so many gods
and heroes into basalt and blackstone 'has
removed his spell, and we breathe again _
the happy sunshine of Egypt. Later Rus-
kallah tried the hill for foxes—vainly, and
as soon as he returned, away went we to
the tune of the rudder, which reminds us
of the sakia we have lost.
