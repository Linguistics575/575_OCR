56 A NILE JOURNAL.

in the transit of Venus, and close by us at
Thebes there are watchful observers. As
our German prince is gone on, we‘ think
he may have hurried to see the transit
scientiﬁcally. We went to bed quite sure
of one thing, that whatever might happen,
there would be no clouds; so we were up
before sunrise, with our noses pressed
against the smoked glaSs, and waiting for
the transit. I have sacriﬁced my window-
pane for the advance of science, and al-
most to our surprise (for one can never
. get familiar with man’s stupendous power
of anticipating 'God’s intention in such
matters), there it was,.a visible spot of dark
upon the luminous disk. And it was
delightful to be seeing this in Egypt. It
has been said that we can never truly
know Egyptian chronology till we can
read their records of eclipses. If they had
stumbled on the lens, what would there
have been for us of later days to ﬁnd out ?
And it would surprise nobody if we yet
found a telescope in an Egyptian tomb.
