A NILE JOURNAL. 217

When dahabeahs meet thus there is often
much racing about of sandals and little
boats, as this whole fraternity of dragomen,
waiters, and cooks is but one great Cor-
poration of the Nile. They have common
interests and common acquaintance. Our
cook has just seen his brother-in-law go by
in sleeves of Tyrian purple, and Paolo
seems to have friends in every boat.

This travelling is no small affair, and in
a good Season there must be between two
and three hundred thousand dollars worth
of property aﬂoat in the service of the
howadgis.

Our party visited a very pretty temple
at Amada, with ﬁgures of Osistasen, so
ancient that it even modernises Aboo
Simbel! What a mere fetish of man’s
‘ancy is this time after all! All lives are
contemporaneous, perhaps, in the eyes of
those whose habitation is eternity.. Here
it is always the same human being with the
earth under his feet and Heaven above him,
for the mere date of his birth counts for little.
