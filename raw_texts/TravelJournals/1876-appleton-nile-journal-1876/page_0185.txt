168 A NILE JOURNAL.

bol of her universal power, swaying the
tided passions as does the moon the tided
seas. The Journal takes a New Year’s
farewell of her in the following lines :—

TO ATHOR.

FAIR Athor, Egypt’s queen of love,
Her double queen of love and light,
St00p from thy shining home above,
And make a Paradise of night.

All love thee, all confess thee queen,
As, girt with many a hand-maid star,
Thy visionary form is seen

Moving in state, serene and far.

Here in this land where all that lives
But symbolises Him alone,

Who the dread boon of being gives,
The unseen, the unimagined one :

Be thou the symbol of the deep
Delighted sense of rest and peace,

Which hangs the poppies round thy sleep,
And dreams with thee o’er land and seas.

Thou healer who canst bid atone

The Day for all the wounds it makes,
And bring from_anguished bosoms ﬂown
Again the peace thine own partakes.
