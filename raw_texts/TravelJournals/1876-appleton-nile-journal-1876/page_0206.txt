between the parted cliffs, the fantastic solitary
crags which stood isolated with forms that
looked like peaks of fancy, it drove as does
a snowstorm in sand-drifts, which, through
this tropic glow, brought to mind the snow-
drifts of New England. We have all seen
such round many a farm-house lane, the
same exquisite and waving curve cresting
the drift, and the same tortured and fanciful
plunges at the end.
