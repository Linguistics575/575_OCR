A NILE JOURNAL. I I7

divides into great’cakes like our Spring
ice. And these hardened footprints always
remind me of the only thing that we have
which can proudly challenge Egypt in
antiquity—the fossil footprints of the Con-
necticut Valley. And the mud must have
been much the same as this. Like this,
it was compacted and triturated by the
drain of a continent. The Connecticut
Valley must have been like the Nile in
overﬂow, and its inhabitants were mostly
aquatic. The gigantic bird footprints are
'now considered to be reptilian, and we
have here already seen huge lizards, which
the natives call the sons of crocodiles, and
one of Which Ruskallah shot, but it turned
over and disappeared into the water.

At Assouan we saw a man whose
profession it is to shoot crocodiles for
travellers. For that purpose he goes with
them for so much money in their daha-
beahs.
