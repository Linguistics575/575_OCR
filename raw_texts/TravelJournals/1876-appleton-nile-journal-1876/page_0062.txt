A NILE JOURNAL. . 51

Tuesday, 8th.

At dawn we found we had regained our
consort and the Russian boat, which proves
to be a Prussian one. Our dragoman says
one of the Emperor’s sons is in it, * a ﬁne-
looking youth, who shows his blood- thirsty
Prussian ways by incessant shooting and
dropping wounded doves, without recover-
ing them, into the river.

The landscape about us has a character
of space, and at times of beauty, we have
not known before. The river sides, too,
have changed their character; Arabia re-
treats and the Lybian hills have come to
. the front; they are more serrated than the
Arabian, less. like a gigantic platform of
rock.

There is no sunshine without its shadow,
and the troubles of life are made more
poignant by its delights. To-day weighed
heavily upon us; we depend upon the
breeze for coolness, and that failed us.

* A dragoman’s inaccuracy.
