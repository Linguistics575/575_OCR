For the last two days we have been the
prey of circumstance, making twenty-ﬁve
miles in all, and unable often to proceed.
In spite of rowing, just now we have been
forcibly driven against a bank by an eddy,
and for our amusement could only watch
some hundred people who poured a basket-
ful of earth at a time upon a dyke where
this same eddy had forced itself through
and drowned the plain. We asked them
what they got for their work, and they
replied: “ Nothing! and are lucky if what
we have is not taken from us besides.” A
lovely government and a patient people,
and such they have been from the dawn of
time!

This morning at Ihkmeen we had a
charming walk through the town, visiting
the bazaar and making sketches of a
street, above which rose a lovely minaret.
