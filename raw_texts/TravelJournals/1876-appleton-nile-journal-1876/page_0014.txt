After a walk under the nigh palms, or
perhaps a ﬂying inspection of the fascinat-

would divide the hours in our dahabeah
between meals and sleep. Thus two days
we loitered, when at last Achmed, king of
men, our reis, appeared. He was a family
man, and coming from Alexandria had
thought it right to give his family the
few hours he had to spare. He was a
man lovely to look upon; as tall and
ﬂexile as a palm, brown as a date, and
sweet with the Same infused sunshine
which makes that fruit so delightful.
Nothing can disturb this tropical pla-
cidity. The Rae/2e! being owned by the
young men of Messrs. Tod and Rathbone,
refused to pay her tax for the bridge at
Cairo, claiming to be English. There
were threats consequently of arresting the
reis, but he came on board tranquil, and
superior to all such disturbance.
