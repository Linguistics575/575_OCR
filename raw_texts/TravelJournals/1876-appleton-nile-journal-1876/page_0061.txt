50 . A NILE JOURNAL.

The breeze held pleasantly, and we
made up for our delays, but at night we
had a misadventure just at a spot where a
branch of the Nile came pouring into the
main river in strong eddies. Two native
boats got in our way, then came the Clam,
for whom we made room, and then the
current sWung our head round; this it did
twice in spite of anchoring, so that we had,
after an hour's delay, ﬁnally to track it.
By this time it was dark and cold, yet our
sailors merrily leaped into the water, and
laughed as they laboured at the rope.
They waded across the broad branch of
the Nile, the cause of our disaster. It was
strange to hear their wild cries while their *
ﬁgures disappeared; as the ﬁle stretched
deeper and deeper in the water, it reminded
me of Pharaoh’s soldiers and his engulphed
host. Soon we were all right, with a ﬁne
midnight breeze blowing due aft. How
soundly we slept after all our anxiety!
