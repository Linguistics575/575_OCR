A NILE JOURNAL. 49

nudity. And this grain must have much
contributed to this; let our farmers’ clubs
look to the matter.

The Clam people looked in on us to
see the birds we had shot. The sic-sac,
which we so naturally called “zig—zag,”
proves to be a plover, and the classic
trochilus of Herodotus, who relieves the
crocodile’s mouth of leeches; only some
dreadful savants will have it there are no
leeches in the N ile. I, in return, went to
see Mr. Porcher’s eagle; it was a young
one, and looked less like an eagle than a
hawk; its bill was longer, with a lesser
curve, and the grand arch'of bone which
protects its eye from the sun, oddly enough,
was wholly wanting. Perhaps it would
have developed later, when older.

A pleasant freshness enters the window—
a visitor from the far north of ice and
newspapers—and in a minute our reis has
pushed us from the bank, and old Nilus
is playing his pleasant music against our
sides.
