.96 A NILE JOURNAL.

understand—a chain of ﬁgures, each alter-
nate one masculine, but with an old
female’s pendent breast. In the corridor
that corresponded on the other side was
a strange series of sculptured pictures of
aquatic sports. Here was the old boat
for ﬁshing, very like an Indian canoe, and
its sails elaborately reticulated, as if bam-
boo over papyrus cloth, were always square.
The long lateen sail, now the only one,
was then wholly unknown; and in these
boats were sportsmen, women being among -
them, who harpooned the hippopotamus
precisely as we now harpoon the whale,
for a running rope was fastened to their
spear. The hippopotami were all repre-
sented very little———its size being incon-
venient—and the sportsmen, like the
triumphing king, made more gigantic than
his victims. The sail of this boat had a
yard at the top, which seemed to turn on a
pivot like the Nile boats now. The ropes
were all indicated, but I suppose this to
have been a boat of the smaller class.
