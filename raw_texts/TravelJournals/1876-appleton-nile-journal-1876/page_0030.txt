A NILE JOURNAL. 19

to our surprise, we found ourselves under
the battlemented cliffs fringing the water
on one side, and old Nile, terrible with
restricted energy, reduced to less than half
its usual size. Here, as the wind was
favourable, and the current strong, great
waves formed themselves as we crossed
the river to get the beneÔ¨Åt of the smoother
margin, which we descended fOr a long
way. We almost sWept the tall cliffs with
our burgee. as we glided by. After a
while we left the cliffs, and by nightfall
reached Asyoot. The Clam came to our
assistance, as we caught badly in the mud,
her men joining with ours in pulling us
out of our troubles. In drawing the boat,
the men pass a slender. loop over their
breast, which converges to a point where
it meets the stout rope which pulls us.
Thus harnessed they look like the. old
Egyptians drawing the stones of the
Pyramids, which probably was done in
the same way.
