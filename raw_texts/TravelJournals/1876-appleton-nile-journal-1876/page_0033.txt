22 A NILE JOURNAL.

Egyptians draw a ﬁgure in proﬁle, with the
eye and shoulder as in a front View, and
a full face of the Japanese has a nose
without shadow, and a mouth like a blown
rose-leaf. But each nation was a great
artist in its way; both fully felt the value
of the outline. The Japanese—for time is
nothing in these things—is the Egyptian of
to-day. ,

But oh, that view from the cavern’s
mouth! well may the Prophet have borne
in his heart some legend of Egypt which
lives yet in the verses of our hymn-book :—

“Fair ﬁelds across the swelling ﬂood,
Stand dressed in living green.”

Never was there such a swelling ﬂood,—
never such a living green. And that rosy
barrier of mountains beyond, how to the
parched child of the desert must they
seem as the Delectable mountains, beyond
whose limit is the heavenly city and bliss
ineﬁ'able!

After the tombs came the bazaar.
