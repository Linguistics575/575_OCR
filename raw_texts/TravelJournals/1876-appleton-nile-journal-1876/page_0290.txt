of yellow, and white being very striking.
Ruskallah brought from his walk huge fossil
oysters, and Eugenio crystals and jasper.
Alas, for Abydus and the grave of Osiris! it
escapes us, and our time for such delights is
short.

These windy grey days are not without
their compensation ; they give us exquisite
sunsets._ Last night’s the Journal tries to
remember by this record.

A SUNSET.

Past emerald plains and furrowed mountains old,
Whose violet gorges snare the wandering "eye,
The pillared palms day’s dying embers hold,
Like shafts of bronze against the crimson sky,
And every cloud mirrors its rosy fold

, In tremulous waves which blush and wander by—
We ﬂoat, and feel the magic penetrate,
Till all our soul is coloured by the hues,
Making a heaven of earth, till, satiate
With splendour, we forego the use
Of speech, and reverently wait'
While fades the glory with the falling dews,
And darkness seals for memory each gleam,
Happy to know it was not all a dream.
