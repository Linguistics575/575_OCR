A NILE JOURNAL. 33

always overhead 'can we see hanging in
the sky the wicked vulture, its shaggy
pin-feathers dark against the brightness.
The ibis is the sacred bird of Egypt—the
destroyer of serpents in the caves of Lybia,
as Herodotus says—or, as some say, loved
of old Egypt for its hostility to locusts.
We see plenty of a smaller white Species;
but I believe we have not as yet seen the
bird sacred of old.* We have offended the
gods by shooting one of the former kind,
and it now hangs with expanded silver
wings above our cabin door. May it not
prove to us modern mariners an albatross,
and bring a curse upon the Rae/2d! But
the popular bird of Egypt is the pigeon or
dove; they build for it in every Nile
.village dove-cotes made of pottery, and
looking like big bee-hives. The pigeons
hover about every town, fearless in their
evolutions; and the aerial circuits of all
birds in Egypt, in grace and playfulness,
* The sacred species is now only found on the

Upper Nile beyond Kartoum.
