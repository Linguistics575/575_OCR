gets at once removed to the far limit of
death and disgrace, even though its date
be our own. No such antiquity as fashions
of ﬁfty or a hundred years ago if true taste
did not keep them for us ever young.
And yet how a line of Homer orr Shak-
speare, an outline of Phidias, seems not
only contemporaneous with us, but ready
for farther ﬂight abreast of all the future
centuries.

And no satisfactory explanation do we
yet have of this marvellous perfection of art
and architecture at what we used to call the
Dawn of Creation. How comes it, if the
new theory be true of man’s painful and
slow emergence from barbarism and bestial
conditions—how comes it that the temple
at Abydus has the secure beauty of per-
fection ?

There is nothing feeble or tentative in
its sculptured ﬁgures; they move like the
thoughts of the poet, serene and buoyant
in the sunny present, and ask no allowance
for immaturity or incompleteness.
