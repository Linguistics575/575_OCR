Who can doubt, seeing as we do now
this nightly spectacle, the poetry of old
fashioned a goddess ﬁt to wear the moon

and sang. The light would ﬂash out into
the night and brighten the smiles upon the
six ﬁgures’ faces, which would have been

temple, and should have had dreams such
as had Joseph in the day when men
believed in dreams.

To escape the ruck of dahabeahs we got off
early, waving our farewells to the everlasting
ones. When we are dust, when the United
States may have broken like a bubble, these
will still smile as serenely as now.
