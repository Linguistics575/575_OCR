A 'NILE JOURNAL

“ But her choice sport was, in the hours of sleep,
To glide adown old Nilus, when he threads
Egypt and Ethiopia from the steep
Of utmost Axum§ until he spreads,
Like a calm ﬂock of silver-ﬂeecéd sheep,
His waters on the plain,—and crested heads
0f cities and proud temples gleam amid,
And many a vapour-belted pyramid. ”
SHELLEY—“ Wild q/Atlaa”
