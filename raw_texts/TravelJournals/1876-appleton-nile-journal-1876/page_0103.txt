88 A NILE JOURNAL.

Thursday, December 17th.

The wind was so light that we did not
start until noon, and then, by tracking; little
by little, that mysterious freshness which
falls out of the sky like an elixir as night
approaches, and with it the breeze—the
friend of coolness—wrought a change on
our somewhat jaded spirits. And the tints
of evening, which begin so early, already
clothed the abrupt and channeled moun-
tains with their mother-of—pearl hues. The
landscape insensibly gains in grandeur as
we advance, and the once level and battle-
mented cliffs now rise at times into, moun-
tain peaks, their shadows of tender violet
lying like chequer work against the golden
brown of their surfaces. And the green,
which once only inundated the plain, now
as the valley narrows, overﬂows at times
even to the water’s edge in malachite brilli-
ancy. It seems to us even lovelier, tenderer,
than ,that of the marvellous plains of
Asyoot. i
