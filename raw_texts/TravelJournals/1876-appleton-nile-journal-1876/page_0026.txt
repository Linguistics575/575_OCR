thing like forty-ﬁve. miles, which was a
fair beginning. The next day the sky
began to clarify, and these ghostly ﬁlms
of clouds, which, like a frown on a child’s
face, mean so little, were smoothing into
that deep thoughtful brow of Egyptian
day, in which so much of the world’s
earliest wisdom was thought out. We
lapped this sunshine with our northern
nerves and felt a little like the men about
us, felt a little of that mind-growth which
makes this river a paragon for what it
does for the harvest of thought as of the
ﬁeld. We made four days to Minieh which
sometimes, through bafﬂing winds, extends
to four times that length, and it was all
delightful! a modest prelude to the grand
things to come; a deep, simple, mournful ‘
music, like that with which the Arabs
welcomed us to their Nile after our ﬁrst
meal; a grand monotony, which had the
simplicity and weight of Bible words.
