It wasn’t a pleasant sight to peOple on
their way to the same danger, and there
was something terribly pathetic in this
solitude of an English grave. Not far
from it was a little Nubian cemetery.‘
Ever since Asyoot the houses have been
more and more Egyptian; their inclined
line exactly conforming to that of a temple’s
propylon. And these little graves looked'
like miniature pyramids of Dashoor. But

which Rome coveted so much, and of
which to-day the museums of the Vatican
and the Louvre are so full! Being there
was indeed being behind the scenes. The
whole crest of the hill had been worked,

* Drowned, we were told, in attempting to go down
the Cataract on a log like the Nubians.
