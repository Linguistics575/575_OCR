A NILE _ JOURNAL. I 3 5

We felt a bond which heldus, though
our national lives are so different. The
American idea seems really more unin-
telligible to the English than it would be
to an Arab. They are under a necessity
of reading us backwards. The devotion
of a country’s youth to its salvation, incon-
ceivable, perhaps, when the spirit of gain
is devouring a nation’s honour, 'must be
read off as ‘ffratricidal contest.” The
exultation and swiftness of national life,
which an American proclaims as frankly
as he feels it, jealousy must describe
as “bumptiousness” and “brag.” The
Arcadian simplicity of young people, which
the duenna and the gouvernante have not
yet overtaken,” is counted as “wildness.”
And yet England’s inability to do justice
to the American idea keeps the nations
wholesomely apart. There is with us
enough sentimental reverence for the home
of our fathers—enough affection for Eng-
land’s literature and greatness to make
America feel truly her child. But it is.
