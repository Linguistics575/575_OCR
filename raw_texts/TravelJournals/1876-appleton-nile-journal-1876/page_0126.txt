A NILE JOURNAL. I I I

look, as if sad for the survival of his fellows.
Uncanny as he is, the cow’s milk is rich
and sWeet. It is the most peaceful of ani-
mals. I fear we shall see few in Nubia,
and nothing can we miss more. Our
fellow-passengers—the chickens, turkeys,
and sheep—it is delightful to see their
enjoyment when liberated from coop and
boat for the shore. The fowls shake out
their feathers, make up their quarrels, and
strut about with the air of Howadjis on
their travels. Our three sheep, with lesser
liberty, tied to a post, instantly fall to on
halfa grass and beans, fattening for they
know not what. There is cannibalism in
the thought of thus eating our fellow-
voyagers, and when shipwrecked in mid
river we recall with a shudder the tales of
sailors eating each other. Of our three
sheep one is very pretty, with spots of black
and white; one a golden brown, as if cut
out of syenite, and with a huge tuft .on his
head, and the largest of Ethi0pian black-
ness, and the proﬁle of Jupiter Ammon.
