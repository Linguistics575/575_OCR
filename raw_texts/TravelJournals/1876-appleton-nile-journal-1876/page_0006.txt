ALICE, EDITH, AND ANNE

MY DEAR NIECES,

THIS is a Journal I kept on the Nile for
your entertainment and my own. It is like a
thousand other journals, full of trivial details, and
without learning or eloquence. Every year a little
deposit of useful mud is left by the Nile upon its
banks, and every year sees deposited upon counters
of the London booksellers the turbid overﬂow of
joumalizing travel. Alas ! it mostly has not the use-

fulness of the leavings of the sacred river.

We who so often have shared the pleasures of
sailing on salt water, I trust may thus enjoy together

a fresh water cruise on this most venerable of rivers.

T. G. A.
BOSTON, Mass,

’ Nov. 10, 1875.
