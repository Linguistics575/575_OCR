A NILE JOURNAL. . 93

As we must not pass everything going
up the river, we treated ourselves to a visit
to the temple here. It was within a
quarter of an hour’s easy donkey trot, and
we arrived with that freshness, without
which such thoughtful sightseeing is a
.losing battle, before the temple’s massive
entrance.

From afar the prodigious walls, covered .
with gigantic ﬁgures, were clearly outlined
in the morning’s light, and insatiate of
sketching, I instantly fell to work, and
Eugenio sent for the box which he had
negleCted to bring; but when brought he
did nothing. He could only sit with
folded hands, saturating himself with such
fulness of beauty as a half-hour’s sketching
must render imperfectly. For this is in
some sense the gem of Egypt. It is a
perfect temple within and without, and we
saluted with honour Mariette Bey, the
present conservator of antiquities, who had
so ‘recently rescued this beauty from the
huts and dirt which .disﬁgured and hid it.
