A NILE JOURNAL. 201

us on a rock, and the imitative Clam doing
the same, thinks she has sprung a leak.
But our delay has been cheered by a
pageant. .The day before yesterday there
seemed to be a regatta on the Nile—an
American regatta. Five noble dahabeahs,
fortunate with the wind which bafﬂed us,
drove by splendidly, the American ﬂag
ﬂying over every stern. The race was
led by our unfortunate friend from New-
buryport, whose dragoman has died on
this passage. After this the little ﬂeet of
General Maclellan, all close together, fol-
lowed. Discharges of guns, wavings of
handkerchiefs, and cries of welcome, were
interchanged as they successively shot by.
Never have we seen dahabeahs sail like
these, and it made a lovely picture. And
to think of the news we missed, which
they carried by, and which we may long
wait 'for. We have had no letters, no
newspapers, for a month, and this truce
with the outer world gives us a deeper
sense of the remoteness of Nubia.
