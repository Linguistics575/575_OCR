4 A NILE JOURNAL.

which all Nile ﬂowed, will wash from us the
rust of narrow quarters. On her comely
little deck we can breathe an air and give
to our eyes a view as boundless as the
desires of any mind, and which makes to
us our dahabeah a universe. And we
ﬁshed, as prisoners do, and caught the
descendants of Memnonian ﬁshes, from
whose brains and through whose gills-still
ﬂowed the silence of the centuries. We
caught a few, but mostly did not. We
had the nibble that enlarges in the mind as
the victim recedes from the hook, and we
liked to listen to the accurate Ruskallah’s
narration of his capture of a ﬁsh of sixty
pounds weight, which fed the crew for
three days, on a previous voyage. Of
course it was a previous voyage. What
ﬁshes have we not caught—what wonders -
not seen—what achievements not done—
all of us on that previous voyage! It is
the catch-all of hope, and saves the disgrace
of the present. But we did catch some,
and eat them, and found they were belied.
