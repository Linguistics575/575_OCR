A NILE JOU'RNAL. 299

aground for several hours, and we saw an
American boat in trouble, apparently from
a broken main-yard.

Two nights since, Ruskallah, in spite of
the rain, went for a couple of hours to the
hills for jackals. Though he got none,
later in the night two jackals ventured
very near the boat, as our sailors noticed.
Our chickens (which they love) at night are
always in coops, and the boat which con-
tains the sheep is kept at night on our
river-side. .

We saw a large fox trotting along the
opposite bank, proﬁting by the tumult of the
storm, as if he were master of the situation.
We have an additional gazelle. Our little
beauty was named “ Kom Ombos,” from the
place at which it was procured, and for the
same reason this older one we christened
“ Minieh.” Our little dove grows and im-
proves daily. Our playful Kiki has
- attained the dignity of matronhood, appa-
rently without knowing it. We have but
to lament the loss of our baby crocodile.
