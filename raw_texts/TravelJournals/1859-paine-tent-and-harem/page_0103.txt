Egyptian race would be the happy person who should
discover a preventive or remedy for the painful and
impoverishing calamity.

Besides the blind, there are no more striking ob-
jects of' misery than the pale, puny, passive, sad, and
sickly-looking children, who, with mothers of a de-
graded aspect, crowd the streets of Cairo, and no one
can regard them without a feeling of wonder, that they
should ever grow and develop into the well-formed,
upright, active Egyptian men; for a crippled or feeble-
looking man is rarely seen.

We experienced the novelty of two or three
showers while in Cairo, and enjoyed the refreshing
and vivifying effects of them during a drive to the
garden of Shoubra. The delightful avenue of four
miles in length leading to it was thickly set with
graceful acacias, and noble sycamores; the extensive '
meadows by the road-side were clothed in the fresh
green of corn, just springing from the earth; and ’
orchards of sombre date, palms, and olives, came hap-
pily into the joyous landscape. It was such a luxu-
riant and promising show of agricultural industry as
we had not seen for a long time; and was another
memento of the enterprise of Mehemed Ali. The
garden has no particular beauty or interest; like all
those of the East, it is laid out formally and stiﬁiy,
with avenues of lemons and oranges, odoriferous shrubs
and ornamental trees, and contains fountains of water,
well supplied by the Nile, which ﬂows by the garden.
