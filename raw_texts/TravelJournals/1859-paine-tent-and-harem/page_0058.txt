than the department containing the little cups of silver
and gold, called zarf, in which the ﬁngian, a small coffee
cup of porcelain is placed, when coffee is presented.

beautiful workmanship, and so richly studded with
.brilliant diamonds, that one might almost imagine the
virtue of Aladdin’s lamp not quite extinct.

Perhaps the bazaar that is devoted to those insin-
uating, irresistible, magical sources of comfort and
consolation, rather exclusively appropriated to the
stronger sex, might be the most attractive to the
lovers of the chibouque and nargilé, which, as every-
body knows, are to be found there in all the various
forms that the reﬁned ingenuity of the luxurious Turk
has been able to invent. The little embroidered sacks
for tobacco, of endless variety of colors, often heavily
wrought in gold, that are the indispensable accompani-
ment of the chibouque in the hand of the pipe-bearer,
form another extensive department. There are yet
others for carpets and rugs; and the silks of Broussa
and Persia, it must not be forgotten, are to be found
in all the bazaars appropriated to articles of dress.
