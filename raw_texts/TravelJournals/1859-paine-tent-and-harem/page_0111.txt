Our household, like every other that insures peace
and tranquillity, is well regulated, but it seems to have
an internal power, peculiar to itself, of self-government.
No orders are ever lmown to be given, and yet every
thing occurs in due season. Planets are not more regu-
lar in their courses; comets do not return with more
certainty than appear before us, at the appointed time,
breakfast, dinner, and tea. Breakfast (dejeuner a la
fourchette) consists, with equal certainty, if mutton is
the order of the day, of that article stewed, minced,
broiledâ€”in short, any thing but a saddle roasted;
while for dinner the same commodity appears, inge-
niously disguised, with the addition of vegetables.

In a region where markets are unknown, it becomes
necessary, of course, to lay in supplies of live stock.
Ours is limited to sheep and-poultry; and who does not
know that where the luxury of an ice-house is not to be
thought of, it is the part of wisdom to make the earliest
possible use of the supplies of the larder ? Thus we
have our mutton days, which are only occasional. The
days for poultry prevail, and come in uninterrupted
succession. Chicken fried, chicken fricasseed, pilav,
omelettes, boiled eggs, tea and coffee, dried white
bread, coarse bread & PArabe, Boston crackers, and sea-
biscuit. What more can the heart of man desire for
breakfast ? Then the turkeys, roast fowl and boiled
fowl, croquettes, and other nice little side dishes for the
dinner table, with, now and then, ham. Think of a
Mussulman cooking ham!
