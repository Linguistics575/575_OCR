150 A COLUMN AT ABSUAN.

We received a visit from our old friend, the gov-

ernor of Derr, at Philm, and another at Assuan. The
governor of Assuan, a respectable-looking old Turk,
called also.
. Among the objects of the greatest interest that we
have seen are the quarries at Assuan. The rock is a
very hard kind of granite. There are immense blocks of
it lying about, and a column, partly buried by sand, the
uncovered length of which measured ninety feet, and the
sides of it, twelve. It lies there, unﬁnished, in the midst
of chippings hewn from it, the marks of the chisel fresh
as if it were the work of yesterday. The unusual ap-
' pearance of this scene of industry, in a land where the
hammer and chisel are at present unknown, might al-
most make one forget the country he is in, and lead
him to expect the sound of the hell that was to call the
laborers to ﬁnish their work. Nothing since Pompeii
had so completely annihilated time.

The governor of Assuan repeated his visit the next
' day, and shoWed his politeness by many really kind in-
quiries after the ladies. But thou must stand aside,
thou little great man, and make room for the illustrious
prince who accompanies thee—a prince of the blood, a
nephew of Mehemed Ali. Some idea may be formed
of his superior rank and dignity by the efforts of Ach-
med to have every thing in order. The rubbish of
books, cages, chameleons, relics, stones, and the thou-
sand and one et-caeteras that one may fancy accumulated
about us in our little parlor, are removed to make way
