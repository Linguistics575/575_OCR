NILE BOAT. 97

sphere, unprotected from the burning sun, or the sud-
den gsts of wind, so frequent upon this river, reigns
supreme this important personage, whose fertile genius
transmutes sheep and poultry into such various forms
as to be able from these simple elements to furnish the
requisite number of courses for a gourmand.

Beneath the deck is a hold, in which is deposited
all baggage not required for immediate use, and here
our boatmen, when not employed, creep in, to shelter
themselves from the sun’s scorching rays or the dews
of the night.

The latine sails, as everybody knows, are the kind
used for the Nile boats, and when these are hoisted,
and we go with the wind, or, as is sometimes the case,
glide along with the current, the cars are laid aside,
the opening in the deck appropriated to the rowers’
benches is closed, and the whole deck. becomes a
smooth, unbroken surface.

This is the most agreeable condition of our boat;
we are no longer cramped for room; our promenade
becomes extended even to the kitchen boundary, and
the men have leisure to perform a variety of antics,
which, aside ﬁ-om their novelty, would relax the rigid
muscles of an ascetic. Thus one may see that our dom-
icil is well adapted to our wants, and I scarcely need
say that we had foresight enough to stock it with all
the luxuries that could be furnished by English bazaars
at Cairo, besides sundry articles that we providently

took with us from Constantinople.
