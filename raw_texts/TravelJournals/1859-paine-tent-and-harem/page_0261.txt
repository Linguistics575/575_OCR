He was master of the camels, and a perfect contrast to
Hoseyn. He was large, straight, as are all the Arabs,
with rather more than the usual breadth of shoulder.
His countenance indicated shrewdness, intelligence,
good nature, and determination. He had a dark-gray,
deep-set eye, penetrating and mirthful. His hair and
beard were black, sprinlded with white. His dress
seemed ill suited to one whose countenance denoted
characteristics that, in our country, would have raised
him to ahigh position. A garment, similar to that worn
by the rest of ‘his tribe, of coarse brown cloth, without
' shoes or stockings, a cotton fez, over which was tied the
red and yellow kerchief; with the long fringe peculiar
to the Bedouin tribes, was his entire wardrobe. In
this patriarchal attire, he‘ was always digniﬁed, know-
ing alike how to render and to command respect. ‘

The two sheikhs had camels for riding ; the
other men, amounting to ﬁfteen or twenty, generally
.trudged along on foot, taking turns of rest upon the
baggage camels, where they invariably laid themselves
down in some shape or other and slept. The motion
of the camel is one that tends to produce excessive
drowsiness. '

We usually travelled about ten hours, and long,
long hours were the last two or three of them. Some-
times we exceeded this, for if there was a spot that had
the attraction of a pool of water or a few succulent
herbs that might answer for the camels, we were sure
.to be dragged on, however exhausted we might be.
