The dogged resolution with which these Arabs persist
in' keeping on to the place they have chosen for encamp-
ment is truly wonderful. They do not condescend to
inform you why you are not permitted to have the re-
pose you seek for, but on. they jog at the same unalter-
able pace, and there is nothing left but to follow.

It was always a joyful moment when we saw the
sheikh deviate from the path and mark the spot for the
encampment. When we had reached it, Mrs. —, with
her cushions and pillows, was always deposited upon
the ground somewhere near, and formed a sort of nucleus
for the rest to cluster round. There, throwing ourselves
down upon the sand, too much exhausted from heat and
fatigue to resort to books or writing, we used to watch
the dexterity of the men while pitching the tents and
unloading the camels.

While this was going on, before our cook had time
to light his ﬁre, we were certain of seeing the black
servant of old Hoseyn march up to us with small cups
of spiced coffee, that had been sent by his master, and
was brought with his compliments. We at ﬁrst thought
it was very gracious on the part of the old man, and
supposed it was intended for one of those acts of cour-
tesy that are twice blessed. But how were we diverted
and amused, when informed, as we soon were, that the
coffee was a portion of what he daily robbed from our
stores for his own use! He never omitted this polite
* attention, which we always received in good faith, and

to tell the truth, it was quite refreshing and acceptable,
