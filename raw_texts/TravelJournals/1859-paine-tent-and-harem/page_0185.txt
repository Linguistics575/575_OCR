172 RUINS or m. mm.

mighty prOpyla, the pyla, the obelisks, the avenues of
granite-sphinxes, the gigantic statues, and the colon-
nades of massive columns, which are here found is be-
wildering confusion. The columns, partly upright and
partly prostrate, with others that have been arrested in
their fall. by adjoining ones, may be not unaptly likened
to a dismantled forest. The time for the erection of
these works of grandeur extended through the reigns
of several kings, among whose names we ﬁnd prominent
that of Remeses the Great. Wilkinson gives the mea-
surement of the grand hall as “ one hundred and sev-
enty feet by three hundred and twenty-nine. This hall
was supported by a central avenue of twelve columns,
sixty-six feet high, without the pedestal and abacus, and
twelve in diameter, besides one hundred and twenty-
two of smaller, or rather less gigantic dimensions, forty-
one feet nine inches in height, and twenty-seven feet six
inches in circumference, distributed in seven lines on
either side of the former.” All of the largest columns
are standing. The huge blocks that formed the roof lie
scattered upon the ground, and ere long this noble ruin
of former splendor will be entirely demolished. ’ The
natural decay caused by the lapse of time is what one
expects, and however much to be regretted, never pro-
duces the unreconciled feeling with which we must al-
ways regard the wanton destruction of conquerors.
We were here refreshed in the midst of our labori-
