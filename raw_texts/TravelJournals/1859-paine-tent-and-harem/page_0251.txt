words bolted. On our arrival at the forest we were
too much exhausted to try the camel’s back home, as
we had intended to do.

The forest had peculiar interest for us. Some acres
are covered with petriﬁed logs, lying among chips and
bark distinguished by marks characteristic of the kind
of tree or shrub of which they were a part. One is a
good deal perplexed in making a choice of specimens
to be borne away. As you handle it you perceive the
impossibility of taking with you many pieces of so
great weight, and a few scarcely combine all you desire.
There are many other localities of petrifactions in dif-
ferent regions about the Nile, although this is said to
be the largest, and is more visited than any other, be-
cause it is so easy of access from Cairo, and furnishes a
day’s amusement for the traveller who may be waiting
impatiently for the necessary preparations to continue
his journey.

We returned to town by the way of the tombs of the
Memlook Sultans. _ This route took us home through
the heart of the old town. The party of camel-riders
had the precedence, and the Mahaﬁ'a followed in the
rear. We entered the narrow streets, lined with bazaars,
and the gaze of the gaping multitude was diverted from
those before us, and ﬁxed with dismay upon us, as we
proceeded, jostling the wretches who chanced to be out-
side of the little shops; and swinging from one side of
the street to the other, we tore away from the bazaars
the blinds and wares with which we had grappled.
