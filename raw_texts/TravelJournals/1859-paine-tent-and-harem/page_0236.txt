Remeses, but it seems out of place. It is extremely
beautiful, and the features and expression resemble
strikingly those of Aboo Simbel. It lies upon the face,
but as the ground is hollow beneath, it is easy to ex-
amine it. The under part is smoothly polished, although
the upper parts, where it has been exposed, are cor-
roded. The lower parts of the legs are broken; but
the upper part of the body is perfect, with the excep-
tion of an arm, which is nearly destroyed by the
natural decay of the stone. It was, a long time since,
presented to the British Museum, and would certainly-
grace even that splendid collection.

In the afternoon we crossed the river to the quar-
ries of Massara. Some notion may be formed of their
prodigious extent, when it is considered that they have
for ages furnished Memphis with stone, and more
recently the city of Cairo.

The ancients seem to have observed great care in
excavating, and the precision and regularity of their
cuttings are very beautiful. In many places are ﬁnely
sculptured slabs, but alas! the destructive Turks and
Arabs have had no mercy upon them, and by means
of blasting have destroyed many of these interesting
relics.

This eminence commands a ﬁne view of the pyra-
mids on the opposite shore, and of the surrounding
country.
