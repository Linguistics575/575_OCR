THE repose of the ﬁrst night was interrupted by the fe-
verish excitement that would naturally attend so novel
an enterprise. We were awakened the next morning,
which was the 7th of May, while the stars were yet
twinkling brightly, and now commenced the realc of a
mode of life which was to continue for more than forty
days. '

By the dim light of the heavenly host, and faint
promises of coming dawn, we sprang from our couches,
and after using a hurried bath in a tin basin, with
a stinted measure of water, we rapidly made our
toilette in time to escape from having our house pulled
down about our ears; for the men always commenced
taking up the pins that fastened it to the ground before
we had quite put in order our sac dc emit.
