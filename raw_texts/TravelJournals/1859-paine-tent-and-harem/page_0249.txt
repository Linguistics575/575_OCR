to travel, in the usual manner, upon the back of the
camel, a Mahaﬂ'a was procured for her.

This Mahaﬁ'a answers for a carriage among the
grandees and princesses of Arabia, and is of such simple
and rude construction as ' none “but the unprogressive
Arab would tolerate; and yet perhaps it answers the
purpose for which it is designed better than any thing
more artistic. It consists of two boxes, about ﬁve or
six feet long, and three or four wide. These are
formed of a framework of tough wood, having a bot-
tom of boards, and sides two feet, perhaps, in depth.
Sticks of the same tough wood are carried over the
top, so as to leave a space between them and the bot-
tom of ﬁve or six feet. Over the rough sticks was
thrown a patchwork covering, intended for an awning.
These boxes, connected by withes and straps ingeniously
placed so as to suit the bumps of the camel, are swung
across the back, and come upon the sides of the animal,
and are fastened by other straps and withes.

The whole of this vehicle, when stretched out upon
the camel, is eight or ten feet wide, and the apartments
are roomy enough to contain several persons, but the
strength of a single camel would not be adequate to so
great a burden. One person on each side is the allotted
weight, and the individual who is destined to be shaken
and tortured has the option of being stowed between
cushions and pillows, the thermometer at 98° or 100°
F., or to take the motion the natural way on bare
boards. But of course, no one submits to a condition
