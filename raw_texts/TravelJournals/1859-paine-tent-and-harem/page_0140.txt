Hum—pm. 127

blowing again so furiously, that we were greatly an-
noyed by it while eiploring the ruin.

But in spite of . our buﬁ‘etings with the sand, which
at times nearly ‘chOked and blinded us, we enjoyed this
temple very much. Its antiquity cannot be traced be-
yond the time of the Ptolemies. Figures, descriptive
of religious subjects, cover the walls, but there are no
historical representations. The sculptures are much
more rounded and graceful than those of earlier Egyp-
tians, and full of beauty. There was one face particu-
larly beautiful, the head covered with a helmet, closely
resembling that which characterizes Minerva. The
early Christians, who converted some parts of this
building into places of worship for themselves, have
covered the heathen images with plaister, and in the
place of them have left most unsightly objects, intend-
ed probably for saints. Certain that it would be im-
possible to make any headway in our boat, we sought
as good a shelter as we could ﬁnd from the wind and
sand behind acme of the old walls.

A group of native men had, as usual, clustered
round, and Achmed, who on these occasions always
acted upon the principle of reciprocity, invited them
to dance for our amusement. Certainly the novelty of
the thing surprised us; but nothing could be more un-
graceful than their movements, which were chieﬂy un-
natural contortions of the chest and shoulders. The
spectators belonging to their own party, however,
seemed highly gratiﬁed. .
