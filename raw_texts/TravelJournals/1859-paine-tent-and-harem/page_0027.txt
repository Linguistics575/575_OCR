hydrophobia is unknown among the dogs at Constan-
tinople.

The streets of Pera and its suburbs may defy all
the world to match them in the inconvenience arising
from bad pavements, dirt, crowds of donkeys laden
with bricks and timbers for building, caravans of camels,
and the taalikas or carriages of the higher classes of so-
ciety that frequently blockade the passage. In the
midst of this transportation of goods, chattels, and
gentry, between buildings that encroach upon the high-
way, which is minus sidewalks, the mixed and motley
multitude of pedestrians that form the great portion of
this Babel contrive to thread a tortuous course; now
arrested by long timbers that, fastened together and
crossed upon the neck of the poor little animal, are left
to ﬂy apart and vibrate, threatening annihilation to the
unfortunate object within their reach; now warned by
the tinkling bell that is suspended from the neck of the
camel of the approach of the long train that follows ;
here seeking shelter in the door of some shop from the
rapid and heavy gallop of powerful chargers mounted
by Turkish chiefs, whose arms are rattling upon the
pummel of the richly embroidered saddle, and the nu-
merous attendants who bring up the rear,—there dex-
terously escaping a crushing pelt from a cargo of brick
that nearly conceals the little victim doomed to bear
it, who, in common with a score of his companions,
left to their own guidance, totter hither and thither as
if in practice for a tilting match.
