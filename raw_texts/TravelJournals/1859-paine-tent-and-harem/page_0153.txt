ON the morning of the 11th we were all grieved to
learn that our young ostrich was found dead in his
cage. He had fallen a victim to his own restless spirit
and quarrelsome disposition. With such a character,
it was scarcely possible that we could have become
very fond of him as a pet, and therefore there were no
tears shed upon this occasion, even by those whose
privilege it is to weep. But we were all sorry to lose
an object that had interested us extremely by an ex—
hibition of those very habits which had prevented our
attaching ourselves to him. He was quite young, not
more than half grown; and his invincible hatred of re-
straint must have been a part of his nature, for he had
not roamed long enough over his'desert .home to have
acquired the love of freedom that was so strong in him.
