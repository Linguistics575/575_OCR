cmo. 93

graceful minaret of Stamboul, light and more sym-
metrical than those of Cairo, arose by the side of a no-
ble dome, the interior of which was richly painted.

The view from the citadel is one of uncommon in-
terest and magniﬁcence, embracing the whole of the
city, which lies far beneath it, and beyond, fertile
meadows, bounded by the undulating desert. Not less
than seven pyramids may be seen from this point.

The bazaars of Cairo have very little attraction for
one familiar with those of Stamboul, and the streets,
although narrower, and, if possible, more crowded and
noisy than those of the capital of the Ottoman empire,
are yet less diﬂicult to perambulate, because, besides
being level, they are ﬂee from pavements and mud.
The roofs of the buildings project so as to form a shel-
ter from the sun. The city is surrounded by a wall,
the gates of which are closed at night.

In the course of some days it was announced that
our boat was in readiness for the contemplated expedi-
tion up the Nile, and we bade adieu, for a few weeks,
to this busy, bustling, jostling, idle city, where may be
seen an odd mixture of European reﬁnement and im-
provements, in grafted upon the stock of manners and
habits introduced by the fanciful, imaginative descend-
ants of the Prophet.

We took our departure by steamer from the wharf
at the harbor of Boolak, and to avoid repetition I shall
take up the course of our travels at the termination of
our voyage up the Nile.
