when he accidentally made the discovery of this room.
He had proceeded some way into the tomb, when he
apparently came to the end of it. But the hollow
sound, produced by knocking on the wall, convinced

came to a deep pit, which he ﬁlled up, and beyond,
found the chamber so rich in drawings. But his
search for the body of the king, like that of every other
explorer before or after him, was in vain. Pits there
are and cenotaphs to lead one astray, but where are the
royal remains ? That is a secret to be yet discovered
by those who are so fast laying open to us the history
of past ages. The whole length of Belzoni’s tomb is
three hundred and twenty feet.

We made an ineffectual attempt to enter the tomb
of Remeses the Great. Mr. went in with great
diﬂiculty and some risk, upon his hands and knees, but
saw nothing. The tomb is unfortunately ruined in
consequence of water beneath. The limestone has
crumbled, fallen in, and nearly closed it.

Think what an amount of treasures and interesting
lore is here lost! I felt deep regret and disappoint-
ment, for I had become so familiar with the works of
this great Sesostris, that a high degree of interest and
curiosity had been awakened to see what would be in
all probability the most magniﬁcent of the catacombs.

Tomb No. 11, called Harper’s or Bruce’s, is the ﬁrst
ever entered by any European.
