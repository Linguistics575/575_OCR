CONSTANTINOPLE. - 9

with Stamboul is visible from the same point, and the
little boats, as they went shooting out from the' arches,
formed a pretty sight. Some of the noble Turkish
frigates that were anchored in the Golden Horn stood
proudly among the small craft.

And on the other side of the Horn, as far as the
line of vision is uninterrupted, lies the city of Stam-
boul, a wide-spread amphitheatre of windows and roofs,
so closely set that there seems no room for passages
among them. Far beyond may be seen the Sea of Mar-
mora, glittering in the sunlight and in the western sky,
gorgeously radiant with the beams of the setting sun,
which, as it sinks behind a dome of massive grandeur,
throws its last brilliant rays upon the gilded points of
the minarets.

Often have I gazed long at those thousands of de-
serted-looking houses, without chimneys, where no sign
of life was to be seen, not even one curling smoke-
wreath, in the coldest days of winter, and wondered
what sort of life made up the sum of the days that
were passed there ; and what sort of beings they were
who, in a great city, could manage to go without din-
ners, and not even enjoy the luxury of a cup of tea.
But when evening came on, and darkness covered the
face of all things, these solitary places were transformed
into lamps of surpassing brilliancy, and the whole .am-
phitheatre was glittering with myriads of lights. It
was a fairy-like scene, not to be fully imagined by any

one who has never witnessed it.
