synagogues, where we found interesting parchments
and relics of former grandeur, kept with .the greatest
care, but much soiled and worn. The buildings were
miserable and dingy, and the descendants of Israel have
all the marks of poverty that characterize them every-
where in the East.

Here we began to see the black round hat that is
worn by the Jews in Palestine ‘only, and strangely
enough it looks beside the universal turban or cap,
.We saw some quite handsome women among them,

~ with ﬂair complexion and blue eyes, and the.men had .

the same complexion, with light hair worn ﬁnite long
about the time. They were an entirelydiﬂ‘erent variet'y
from those we had been in the habit of seeing at Con-
stantin0ple, and were less abject. Indeed, at the lat-
ter place there was rather an assemblage of varieties,
from diﬁ'erent countries to the north and east of Tur-
key. Contrary to the usual supposition, they were
distinguished from the western Jews by the conforma-
tion of their features, of which the shape of the nose
was most conspicuous. But as this cannot be ascribed

to intermarriages, nor to any material diference in their ,

habits, it is probably owing to the inﬂuence of climate
and country.“ As we met with them in. J udea, the
familiar features were everywhere predominant ; and
coming to Jerusalem, we fully realized that, ndtwith-

standing their abject condition, they must have a eon-3

sciousness, while hovering about the tombs of their
ancestors that no common blood ﬂows in their veins.
