which continues three days. The ceremony of Miss-
pied, which takes place on the ﬁrst morning of the fes-
tival, is open to strangers, and is purely Oriental in its
character. '

The Sultan goes at sunrise, in great state, to the
Mosque of Achmed, for prayer, accompanied by the
pachas, ofﬁcers, and soldiers. After that is over, he
returns to the great court of the palace at Seraglio
Point, where the ceremony of baisepied, or kissing of
the Sultan’s foot, takes place. The fate is anticipated
the previous evening by the ﬁring of heavy guns from
the batteries, illuminated minarets, &c.

In order to be in time for procuring a good position
to see the parade, we were obliged to go at a very
early hour in the morning, and accordingly left Pera
(where we had lodged the night previous, for the pur-
pose of being as near as possible) before the day began
to dawn.

At the early hour of our entering Stamboul, the
sides of the streets and the courts were strewn with
bodies of the lower classes of men, who were sleeping
there, where they probably found it more comfortable
than in their own small rooms. But as we approached
the palace, we found all wide awake and animated.
Many taalikas and some other carriages were already
there, besides many persons on foot. The gate was
blocked up by a large number who had assembled, and
soldiers were stationed there for the purpose of keep-
ing order.
