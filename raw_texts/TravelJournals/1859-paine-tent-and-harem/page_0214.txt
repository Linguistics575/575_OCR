Shall we see the handsome Pacha here ? This is
his place of residence, and the clean streets add another
feather to his cap. We look in vain for him, so let us
leave these indolent Turks to their repose, and proceed
into the narrower streets, among the half-veiled, dirty
Egyptian women, who, with their children upon their
shoulders, are strolling about the streets, or peeping at
us from the doors of the mud cabins. Poor, ignorant
mothers! we would like _to. impart to you a little of our
superior knowledge, which would enable you to con-
vert these pale, squalid little ones, into ruddy, robust
children. We sigh as we think of the herculean labor
we should encounter in attempting to overcome and
root out long established customs and prejudices, and
are lfoused from our reverie, by the cry of “Imsheh,.
imsheh, osbour, osbour,” uttered by our little Musta-
pha, the water-carrier, who chances to be in advance.
Boy, though he is, his cry of “ get out of the way and
wait,” is‘obeyed.

The progress of the camels is arrested on the other
side of the gate through which we are to pass. They
are turned out of the way by the Arab drivers, who
throw against them‘dtheir stout bodies. We pass
through and continue our way on this delightful avenue,
until we come to a ﬁne, narrow, stone bridge. We
cross it and are at the foot of the mountain. There is

no diﬁculty 1n riding to the ﬁrst catacombs, half way
