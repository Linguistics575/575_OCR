knives and forks of silver and gold, and the table was
beautiquy decorated with handsome glass and ï¬‚owers.

It was estimated that there were two thousand per-

ants. The bridegroom, with his friends, celebrated the
festival in the apartments of his father. The wedding
ceremony had been performed, at early dawn, at the
house of the bride. The festivities were to continue
ibr three days. ,

The garden was thrown open for the poor and ple-
beians who chose to come and enjoy the music, danc-
ing, and jugglery provided for their amusement. The
immense crowd collected there, and the numerous [edib-
jis and other attendants, partook liberally of the prince-
ly entertainment.
