into place, resembling the noise of a loom and shuttle,
then a voice from some old crone, leaning over the
balustrade, demands by a peculiar toss of the head that
accompanies her unintelligible jargon, the whys and
wherefores of your visit. Happy the stranger who,
without an interpreter, succeeds in ascertaining whe-

In warm weather the street door is always open,
and then one may be sure of ﬁnding two or three ser-
vants loitering about the door. Families of wealth
and those who live in much style have always a porter
at the entrance.

Houses of the higher classes, comprising ofﬁcers
of government, bankers, and rich merchants, however
ordinary the exterior of the building may be, (and
they are frequently in a very dilapidated condition,
the brown boards pleading loudly for a coat of paint,)
have rooms elaborately ﬁnished, with beautifuny
carved wooden ceilings, highly gilded and gaily col-
ored with blue, red, green, yellow, &c., altogether
producing a striking and pleasing effect. The sides
of the rooms are nearly always of wood, more or less
carved and variously ornamented. But the most
elegant apartments have no furniture, unless the divan
may be denominated such, not even carpets, which
would, for certain reasons, be quite objectionable in the
East. Marble fountains and conveniences for purify-
ing, according to the demands of the Mohammedan
religion, are usual in Turkish houses.
