three ladies, whom we supposed to be the wives of the
Pacha. him. was sure the eldest was the favorite
wife, to which we were all obliged to agree; for it was
plainly her prerogative to command. If we were right
in our conjectures, the power of goodness over youth
and beauty was manifest. It was plain enough that
the others owed obedience to this woman, with a goo d-
natured, but by no means pretty face, disﬁgured by the
loss of an eye. The pettish manner of the girl, as she
snatched the keys handed her for the third time, was a
convincing proof that there was a diﬂ'erent relationship
between them. It was the manner of a spoiled child,
and she must be a younger sister. Our surprise was
great when this youthful woman cleared up all doubts,
by telling us that they were both her daughters, twins.
The plainest of them was married. They were perfect
children of nature; one might call them savages. We
were much amused by their artless, untutored behav-
ior. They examined our dresses, felt of them, and the
one by my side pointed signiﬁcantly to my pocket and
my hands. At length it occurred to me that‘she wished
to look at my gloves, which she had seen me take of
and put in my pocket; so I drew them out. She seized
them and made an unsuccessful attempt to put one on
her hand. I relieved her from her difﬁculty by draw-
ing one on my own; and, when I looked for the other,
° lo, it was across the room, on the hand of her more ex-
pert sister. Theu she took my ungloved hand and ex-
amined it; I thought she was going to tell my fortune.
