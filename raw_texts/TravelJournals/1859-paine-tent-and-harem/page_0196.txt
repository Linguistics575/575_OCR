VISITTQAWATTHEBB. 183.

stances—we waited for an example, and followed the one
given by taking some of the kabobs with our ﬁngers;
and it was really nice, as the garlic had been omitted,
and frmh green peas had been substituted. A pair of
plump, ﬁnely browned chickens were next served. The
mystery was, how they were to be carved without a
_ knife. This was soon solved by our sultana, who
rather gracefully commenced a demolition with her ﬁn-
gers. When it was in a condition to be eaten, she took
a leg, and, biting off a piece of it, handed the remainder
to Mrs. , which was an act of extreme politeness.
'The rest of us were then urged to partake, which we
did, of course.

A dish of pilav, which is rice and chicken stewed
together, -a favorite dish with the Turks, was then
brought in. When suited to their taste, like almost
every thing, it is higly seasoned with garlic. ,But here,
again, was a regard for our comfort; the garlic was
omitted. It was savory, and we ate of it with spoons.

Our hostess, in the mean time, was busy, picking up
i with her ﬁngers delicate tit-bits of chicken, which she
added to the pilav. She ate nothing herself, but talked
all the while she was thus occupied. A , dish of garlic
and gumbo followed, into which we dipped pieces of
bread and choked them down.

With a dish of sweets and clotted. milk, (yaourt,)
our repast was ﬁnished ; and, again bathing our hands, .
we arose from the table with grateful, contented hearts,
and wiser than we sat down.
