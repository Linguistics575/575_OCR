CHAPTER XIII.

TRIP TO m SECOND CATARAOT—OHABACTER 01' THE BOAT AND ITS
OCCUPAN'I‘B—SEBVANTS—DRAGOHAN—CBEW—PLEASUBES OF AN EX-
PEDITION ON THE NILE.

WE were six weeks in maln'ng our voyage to the sec-
ond Cataract of the Nile, which is nearly nine hundred
miles aboveAlexandria. The winds were adverse, and
we were a much longer‘ time than is usually required.
But let no lone suppose that the traveller who is not
pressed for time can murmur at any delay in this deli-
cious climate. . ‘ .

. Let me describe the character of our boat, the na-
ture of the comforts by which we were surrounded,
and the kind of life we led while proprietors of this
little ﬂoating habitation, for I am sure all will agree
with me that this is the very perfection of travelling.

I do not mean to state in round numbers the length
and breadth of our boat. Suﬁice it to say that it was
large enough for our accommodation, and would be
~ for any party of the same number as reasonable as
ourselves, and none others ought to leave their own
homes. .
