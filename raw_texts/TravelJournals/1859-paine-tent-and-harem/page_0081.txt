31GB) OBEEBVANCE 01' THE TURKISH FAST—FEAST OF BAIBAM—PRO-
CESSIONS—SULTAN—CEREMONY Ol‘ BAISE-PIED.

THE Turks have a fast of a month, which they ob-
serve with extreme rigor. They deny themselves food
ﬁom sunrise to sunset, not even taking a glass of
water, and the gratiﬁcation of the chibouque is dis-
pensed with. The most laborious classes never indulge
in any thing until after the ﬁring of the sunset gun,
and one may believe that the sound which is to liber-
ate them from such painquy scrupulous observance of
the ceremonial is received with all the manifestations
of pleasure of which a famished body is capable.
During this period those in high life usually doze
away the‘ day ; but for the poor hborer, and especially _
the kdilcy'i, whose arduous duties are as indispensable
as at any other time, there is no mitigating oblivion.
Let it be said to his credit, that he hears himself un-
der his privations like a true philosopher, performing
cheerfully and faithfully the task imposed upon him.
This fast is terminated by the Feast of Bairam,
