TEMPLE OF KALABSHL 138

forming, as it were, an insulated chamber in the midst
of the temple, a mode of construction which I observed
at Dakke and afterwards at Philm; two low columns
stand within the cella.‘ In the adytum are the remains
of columns lying on the ground, the only instance of
the kind I have seen in any Egyptian temple; in its
walls are some low dark recesses and windows or loop-
holes, like those at Tintyra; its roof is formed of sin-
gle blocks of stone, reaching the whole breadth, and
upwards of three feet in thickness.

“ There is a chamber behind the adytum, as at
Dakke, and communicating with it by two doors; the
roof has fallen in, but it'may be seen that the cham-
ber was lower than the adytum, and had a chamber
over it. '

“ In the walls of this chamber are several cells or
recesses, each of which forms two small apartments,
one behind the other, divided by a narrow entrance,
and just sufﬁciently large to hold one person; they are
closed in front by a stone, which may be removed at
pleasure, and were perhaps prisons for refractory
priests, or places of probation for those who aspired to
the priesthood. ‘ The persons who were placed in them
may be literally said to have been shut up in the wall,
_ as there} not the slightest appearance of any recess
being there when the stones which close the outer en-
trance are in their places. I observed a hollow stone
in the interior of one of them; but I am not certain
whether it was a sarcophagus or not.
