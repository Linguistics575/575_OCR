their heads the cumbrous and heavy vessel, with as
much apparent ease as if it were a feather, ascended
with nimble steps to their respective habitations.

We landed early in the afternoon, and were not a
little surprised to ﬁnd nice European carriages, a lux-
ury we had by no means thought of. They were pre-
ceded by a runner, who, with a koorbash, (a whip of
great length,) with the appendage of a powerful snap-
per, ran and leaped with incredible dexterity, cracking
his whip in the meanwhile, so as to give notice to all
in the streets to clear the way. We afterwards found
that such a person was the forerunner of all carriages
and processions, which he precedes in this way quite
to the outskirts of the city.

We drove to the hotel, through a beautiful avenue
of luxuriant acacias, the work of the benefactor of
Cairo, Mehemed Ali. In a few moments we were sit-
ting at an open window, enjoying the soft, delicious
atmosphere of an Egyptian Winter’s day.

Our hotel, which if not the only one at Cairo, was
as good as any, could boast of a situation that fur-
nished its inmates with endless amusement. It stood
upon the principal new street, facing the large public ’
gardens, so that, besides the refreshing green 'of the
trees and shrubbery, among which were to be had
, glimpses of showy ﬂowers and striking ﬁgures saunter-
ing about in the avenues, there was alwaysjpassing
beneath our windows some picturesque group or fes-
tive scene, that kept us ever on the alert.
