28 SWEET WATERS.

Parisian etiquette, manners, and customs, prevail in
all the circles of society that have felt the' inﬂuence of
Franks. Nowhere are the laws of fashion a la mode ole
Paris so rigorously observed. There are numerous
boutiques furnished with elegant and fanciful decora-
tions in French millinery, and the richest of . silks, vel-
vets, and laces , yet many ladies are in the habit of
importing their wardrobes directly from the city of
- modistes. ~

The strict observance of arbitrary rules extends even
to the color of the riding dress and gloves, which are
always white kid. French language Is the language of
society, and French dishes are a la mode.

Frank ladies never go out unattended, and those of
any rank are often preceded by a cavasse, who is a sort
of ofﬁcial personage, invested with authority to clear
the way, and exact other higher though not more im-
portant acts of obedience. Following in the rear are
usually two or three servants, and as pe0ple are not
happy enough to ﬁnd room for the social position of
two abreast, the whole party, scattering along in Indian
ﬁle, makes quite a formidable appearance.

The most severe lesson to be learned in the ups and
downs of the streets is proper heed to one’s ways; and
this is all the more diﬁicult to accomplish, in conse-
quence of the never ending variety of attractive and '
novel objects that meet the senses.

The usual manner of going to parties is in a sedan
chair, or chaise a porteur, as it is always called there.
