would we gladly have availed ourselves of such a

the caravan was not to be disregarded.

The perfect cleanliness of our places of encampment
was most agreeable. There were no ﬂies, ﬂeas, nor
musquitoes, no appearance of animal life; nothing to
show that ever mortal had been there before. The
very gravel had a clean look, as if it were just as it came
from the hand of its Creator. With what a peculiar
feeling of trust and composure might one lie down here
and sleep. We saw no traces of encampments all
through the desert. The extreme regard of the
Bedouin for cleanliness leads him to bury the refuse of
the table, and, indeed, every thing that may be oﬁ'en-
sive to the eye; and thus it was, that but for the paths
which betrayed the print of the camel’s foot, we might
have cheated ourselves into the belief that we were the
ﬁrst party of adventurers that had ever traversed the
land. .

We had been informed of these, and other peculiar
characteristics of this race, by our kind friend Mrs. L.,
previous to leaving Cairo, who assured us also, that we
might feel certain of being treated with the greatest

.respect and delicacy by even the lowest of the tribe.
We happily proved the truth of her assertions, and it
was to the noble regard shown to the sanctity of our
tents by these uncivilized men that we owed much of
our comfort and real tranquillity.
