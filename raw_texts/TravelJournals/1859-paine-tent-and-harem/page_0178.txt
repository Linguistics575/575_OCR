TOMBS or m was. 165

wholly divested of the surroundings which formerly
harmonized with them, and from which they must have
derived much of their grandam. Seemingly misplaced,
as they are, thus alone under the vast canopy of heaven,
one wonders what they can be doing, and why they
are thus sitting there at their case in this busy world,
with their hands upon their knees.

Thus much for a bird’s-eye view of the tout ensemble.
The next day we made an excursion to the tombs of
the kings. We entered ﬁrst the one discovered by
Belzoni, of which the colors are still surprisingly beau-
tiﬁll, although said to be much less brilliant than when
opened by him for the ﬁrst time thirty years ago.
But it is not from its coloring, nor yet its sculptures,
that this tomb derives its peculiar interest, for both of
these are inferior to what may be found in some others.
There is a chamber here, which is a rare curiosity. In-
stead of having been under the hands of the painter
and the chiSeller, like the others we had seen, the walls
remain covered with drawings of very high merit.
They are ﬁrst done with red chalk, in a free, bold,
artistic manner, then traced with black, for the sculptor,
after which, in many instances, they have been correct~
ed by the red chalk of the master. The comparative
gracefulness of these drawings might show that the
angles which characterize the paintings and sculptures
of the Egyptians, are rather the fault of the colorer and
chiseller, than of the designer.

The joy of Belzoni must have been great, indeed,
