Birds, ﬂying in and out of the windows at their pleas-
ure, more free than the wealthy mistress of the mansion,
lent a charm to this novel scene, and we were much
amused by one restless little. fellow, who hovered about
the looking-glass, peeking at his image, as he saw him-
self reﬂected in it. We were assured that he had been
ﬂuttering about the glass in this way for ﬁve or six
days, and as nearly every thing is viewed as an omen
by these simple creatures, this was so construed, and
conspired with the dream to increase the depression
of spirits which bore heavily upon our interesting
friend.

Many a hearty regret was expressed by her that we
had not made her house our home while at Luxor, and
1 some of our party regretted it also.

At length, we must go. It had been a point with
our kind hostess that we should remain until sundown.
That time had come, and there was now no excuse
for detaining us longer. She followed us down stairs,
with many expressions of good will and hearty bless-
ings.

We were at the gate; the hand of the black porter
rested upon the latch, and we were wondering why he ,
did not open it, when the “ imsheh, imsheh,” (go away!
go away!) which he uttered to his mistress, reminded
us that we were quitting a prison, and our hearts sick-
ened at the thought of leaving this woman, who had so
graciously and agreeably entertained us, a prisoner
within her own walls.
