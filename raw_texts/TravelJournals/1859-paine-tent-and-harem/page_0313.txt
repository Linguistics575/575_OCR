300 on on war TO M

We were now to have the fourth variety of travel-
ling. We had tried steamboats, the Nile-boat, camels;
and here, before our door, stood an array of horses and
mules. The horses were saddled and bridled, and the
asses and mules loaded up to the ears with luggage.
They looked so inferior to the camel, and so unequal to
bearing the burden put upon them, that we reluctantly
took them in exchange for our noble, long-tried fellow-
laborers.

The squalid, miserable appearance of the Syrian
Arabs, who were henceforth to be our attendants, by
no means pleased us. They looked like men degraded
by vice, Bunker? in their own esteem, and consequently
excited our distrust. We felt that the romance of
travelling was past, as, indeed, we afterymrds found it
to be. But we were “ going up to Jerusalem,” and it
was better that the absorbing interest of the journey
should be undisturbed by any accessory objects.
