IT was early in the winter of 1 850 that the noble
steam frigate Mississippi made her way over. the Sea of
Marmora, and entered gracefully into the harbor of the
Bosphorus. .

fusely glazeihouses and lofty mosques, whose stately
minarets seemed to stand as sentinels to receive and
repeat the tidings of her joyful arrival. -
