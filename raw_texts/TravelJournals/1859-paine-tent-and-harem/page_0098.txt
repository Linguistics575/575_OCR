W WEDDING. ' 85

Then two priests took two cords, and standing one be-
hind the groom and the other behind the bride, put the
two cords together round the heads of the bride and
bridegroom and tied them at each end. This was fol-
lowed by a long chant or prayer, and then the bride
and groom partook of the sacrament. The wafer was
taken on the tongue from the hand of the priest, and
they ‘took wine.

This ceremony usually occupies three hours; but,
in consideration of the excessive heat of the room, it
was, on this occasion, much shortened. The bridal
pair stood, through the whole of it, with their fore-
heads joined, excepting perhaps ﬁve minutes, when
chairs were brought them for rest. During all that
time the sponsor held the cross, at arm’s length, be-
tween their faces, which must have been a very painful
position. The thick veil was not removed from the
time of the bride during the ceremony, and she was
evidently overcome by exhaustion... Water was fre-
quently oﬂ'ered her, and a female attendant repeatedly
wet her handkerchief with cologne.

After the ceremony she left the room, the golden
veil was removed, and she returned to join the rest of
the party in dancing and feasting, which continued till
morning. Refreshments of cake and lemonade were
passed about during the evening; and at three o’clock
there was a sumptuous repast.
