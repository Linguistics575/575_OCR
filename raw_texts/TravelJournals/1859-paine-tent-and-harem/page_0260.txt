om sun-um HOBEYN. 247

fol lineaments of his face, the long, ﬂowing, silky, white
beard, the grace and urbanity of his manner, all com-
bined to inspire admiration, respect, and veneration.
His eye, and that alone, warned one to beware of him.
It was a soft hazel, small and round, and full of duplicity
and cunning. His usual dress was a long robe of striped
red and white Damascus silk, over which he sometimes
wore a black woollen bournous; his head was covered
with a fez, round which was twisted carelessly, but
gracefully, a turban of thick white muslin, and over that
was thrown a gay red and yellow striped silk handker-
chief, with a fringe eight or ten inches deep. It was in
this dress he made his appearance to us at our hotel in
Cairo, excepting that over the robe of Damascus silk
was one of scarlet broad-cloth, embroidered with gold,
and as this was a special occasion, the robe was left
somewhat open in front so as to permit the under ap-
parel of white to be seen.

Afterwards, at the time of his congé at Hebron, he
presented himself in a dress of state. Over a robe of
silk was the one of scarlet broad-cloth, and over that
was one of superb black broad-cloth. A ﬁne Cashmere
shawl was wound in careless folds about his turban, and
the old man, courteous and perfectly at his ease, was
magniﬁcent. His person did not appear overloaded,
and his movements were free, graceful, and digniﬁed.
He was small of stature, and his thin body could bear
such a quantity of vestments.

The other sheikh—we had two—was subordinate.
