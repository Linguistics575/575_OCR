A TROPICAL EVENING. 139

Scarcely any thing remains of one of the temples
at Tafa; the other is very small, but in a ﬁne condi-
tion, having only one room, in whichare four beautiful
columns, but no sculptures or inscriptions. It had been
so long since we had seen 'a decent human habitation,
that we could not help being struck with the ﬁtness of
this as a place of residence for some person of taste,
and speculated upon the ease with which a little con-
trivance would transform it ﬁ'om a musty temple into
a bij on of a palace.

The evening was one of the ﬁnest that we had
known in this Arcadian region. Although really out
of the tropics, having bid adieu to them at Kalabsha,
we were not far enough distant to perceive any change;
and the peculiarly soft and transparent hues of a trop-
ical sunset hardly ceased to glow, when the moon poured
her scarcely less luminous beams upon the face of na-
ture, and bathed the rocky cliﬁ‘s in 8 mystic light, that
made them seem doubly a mockery of art, if, indeed,
art be not a mockery of them. The glory of the heav-
ens, transferred to the reﬂecting bosom of the water,
was multiplied in the ripple occasioned by the oars;
and as, lost in revery, we gazed at those lucid orbs, far
down below, playing tricks upon our fancy, in a sort
of “ hide-and-seek ” frolic, might we not be pardoned
if we were found sporting, like children, with these
images of the deep.
