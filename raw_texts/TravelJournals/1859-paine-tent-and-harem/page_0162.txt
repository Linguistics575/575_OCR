SECOND QATABACT. 149

like a thing of life, when she recovered from the plunge,
amidst the wildest shouts and cheers of her numerous
boatmen. There she waited fer us, and we returned
to be conveyed through a less formidable portion of
the rapids. That omnipotent personage, the rais of the
' Cataract, manifested his superiority by screaming and
shouting in a voice that might have drowned the roar
of Niagara. He did nothing,-that I could see, but ges-,
ticulate furiously, and as, in spite of it all, the boat went
with some force against a rock, he became almost fran-
tic, and redoubled the violence of his screams and wild
gestures. The rudder, which was broken by this con-
cussion, was soon repaired; Scylla was passed without
farther accident, and the captain’s tranquillity was
restored.

N ow came a demand from the captain of the Cata-
ract for something to revive and cheer his spirits, after
this exhausting performance, which had occupied about
two hours. There was nothing singular in the demand,
for many a Mussulman is as well aware of the restora-
tive nature of gin' as his Christian brethren. But the
reason assigned for taking it at this time was quite
novel to us, and shows a diﬁ‘erent state of society from
any that we are accustomed to. He said that he espe-
cially Wished for some gin, because he was in the pres-
ence of ladies.

We were glad to get to Assuan, that we might be
relieved of this troublesome people, and have our boat *
go through with a process of ablution.
