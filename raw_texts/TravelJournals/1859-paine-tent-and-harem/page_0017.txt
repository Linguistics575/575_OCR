ﬂag with its star and crescent, marks the site of the
adjoining arsenal, from which the word Tcphanah de-
rives its origin.

A little beyond, following the shore of the Bos-
phorus, which is lined with rather dilapidated wooden
buildings, is the palace,of the Sultan, the one built by
Mahmoud IL, conspicuous for its light and tasteful ar-
chitecture, so happily suited to its position; the ﬂight
of white marble steps, leading down to the water from
the whole length of it, harmonizing beautifully with
the pale amber color of the building, and the white
latticed windows. Still beyond, and near by, stands
the more stately palace of stone erected by the present
‘Sultan, Abdul Medjid.

We were set ashore in one of the ship’s boats, ac-
companied by some of her gentlemanly oﬁicers, and
the neat and orderly appearance of our sailors, in blue
dress and bright buttons, with white collars and black
tarpaulins, contrasted strikingly with the ‘turbans and
fezes of the loosely robed kdz’kjis who were resting
in the confused crowd of little boats, through which
we strove to thread our way to the landing at T0-
phanah.

Wonderful skill and dexterity are required to navi-
gate the way through such a plantation of boats, amid
brawling and disorder enough to drive one mad; and
when a successful opening is made by wedging in
through the mass, ten chances to one but the boat en-
counters another, that pushes it back to take a new start.
