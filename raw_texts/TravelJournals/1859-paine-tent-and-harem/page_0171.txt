'breadth, and the centre of the arch is ten feet high.
The sculpture, although not of the highest order of the
Egyptians, is well done, and the coloring, in some parts,
very fresh. _

Wilkinson gives the following faithful exposition of
these pictorial vestiges: ‘

“In the ﬁrst line in the agricultural scene, the peas-
ants are employed in plowing and sowing, and ﬁ-om
the car which is seen in the ﬁeld, we are to infer that
the owner of the land, (who is also the individual of the
tomb,) has come to overlook them at their work. In
the second line they reap wheat, barley and doura, the
distinction being pointed out by their different heights.
In the third is the carrying and tritura, or treading
out of the car, which wascgenerally performed through;
out Egypt by means of oxen, and the winnowing, meas-
uring, and housing of the grain. The doura was not
submitted to the ma process as the wheat and barley,
. nor was it reaped by the sickle, but, after having been
plucked up by the root, was bound in sheaves, and car-
ried to the threshing-ﬂoor, where, by means of a wooden
beam, whose upper extremity was furnished with three
or four prongs, the grain was stripped from the stalks;
which they forcibly drew through them. Below, are
the cattle, pigs, asses, and goats belonging to the de-
ceased, which are brought to be registered by the
scribes. In another part they weigh the gold and his
property; there are fowling and ﬁshing scenes, the oc-
cupation of salting ﬁsh,” &c. o
