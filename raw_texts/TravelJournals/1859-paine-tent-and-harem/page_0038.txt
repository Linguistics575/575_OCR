shores are covered with motley crowds of persons
loitering on the way. And then come pouring into the
glen richly gilded taalikas, with festooned curtains of
bright colored silk, such as Queen Mab might fancy,
drawn by one or two horses, guided by a man walking
by the side of the carriage with long reins; fantastic,
roomy, springless arabas, containing a dozen persons,
drawn by dove-colored oxen with red trimmings—the
tail attached to a piece of bowed wood that is decorated
with heavy tassels of red worsted, and, passing over
the back, is fastened to the yoke. Frankish men and
women on horseback, and occasionally a European car-
riage, detract from the romance of the scene.

Women and children issuing from the cushioned
taalikas, in the bottoms of which they were seated
a la Turque, and from the arabas and kaiks, attended
by black slaves bearin g rugs and cushions, pipes and
nargilés, group themselves into little parterres; and
when the lawn is covered with the diversity of bright
colors in all their various shades, it presents the gaudy
appearance of a garden of tulips, and the bright red
fezes of the men bear no slight resemblance to beds of
poppies and. dahlias.

There may be seen scattered about among them a
multitude of harlequins, who furnish the amusements
that are to help while away the day. Bulgarians, with
dancing bears and tambourines, others with bagpipes
that know no rest, perhaps a few jugglers, and the list
is ﬁnished.
