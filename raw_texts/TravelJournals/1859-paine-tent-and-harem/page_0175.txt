to a more limited domain, and so he marched 011‘ with
himself before he came into our possession. Recollect-
ing the trouble the other had given us, we were nowise
loth to leave him behind, which we did, with the assu-
rance that, if retaken, he should be forwarded to us.

We were cheated by some traveller’s book into the
belief that the temple of Arment was one that should
not be neglected, and on the morning of the 23d we
mounted donkeys and wended our way thitherward.
We had, indeed, the agreeable diversion of a ride of
about two miles, on a ﬁne morning, over a plain that
had nothing in particular to mark it.

What remains of the temple is of inferior order. It
appears to have been consecrated to Athor, and is cov-
ered on the outside with representations of that god-
dess and Cleopatra, who holds in her lap the little Oua-
sar. We were induced to visit this temple, chieﬂy in
the hope of seeing something that might be considered
a portrait of that famous queen, but the uniformity of
features and expression found in the various faces of
Isis, Athor and Cleopatra, led us to believe that it was
merely a conventional face. The disappointment grow-
ing out of this affair was not of very long duration, for
at 1 1 o’clock we were at Luxor.

We had no sooner arrived than we received the civil-
ities of consuls and sheikhs, and when the indispensable
compliments and invitations to tea, and all kinds of well-
meant oﬁ'ers were ended, we determined upon com-
mencing our researches on the western side.
