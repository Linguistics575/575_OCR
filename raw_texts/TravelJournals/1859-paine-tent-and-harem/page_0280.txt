SCENERY IN THE DESERT. 267

the day, from 90° to 100° F., the same as on a frosty
night in winter, and your hair snapping and bristling,
so that it is nearly impossible to comb it ! ” This con-
dition of the atmosphere was what rendered the desert
tolerable. I ﬁnd often recorded in my journal, “ Ther-
mometer 100°, or 103°, or 106° F., and yet I have fre-
quently suffered more from heat in the valleys of Ver-
mont. The nights always cool and delicious, some-
times chilly.”

On the morning of the 2lst of May we left our en-
campment, which was the seventh from Suez, and con-
tinued through scenery of increased desolation. For
an hour or two in the morning we had Mount Ser-
bal behind us in all its grandeur, and then lost it, pass-
ing among smaller hills, huge boulders, and hillocks of
earth, that appear to have been left standing while all
around was washed away. Then we came to a rocky
deﬁle, passing which, we had a view of an immense
plain, which we parted from on our left, turning to the
right through a pass where the mountains were on
either side a thousand feet high, jagged, craggy, and
peaked, so perfectly naked and veined that they seemed
more the skeletons of mountains, having not only the
backbone, but the ribs also.

Sheikh Moosa accompanied us on our way this day.
Indeed, we seemed to be in favor with the tribe, for we
were accosted by other sheikhs, who solicited our com-
pany to breakfast. But there was no more time to
spare upon recreations of this sort.-
