Wn next visited the small temple of Amada, not far
from Derr. This is of the time of Osirtarsin 111.,
about 1636 B. 0. Like the one at Aboo-Simbel, it is cut
in the rock, and was much ﬁlled with sand. We found
the sculptures very ﬁne, and the colors exceedingly
brilliant. We made out several cartouches of Osirtar-
sin, who reigned near the time that Joseph died, and
also of Thothmes III., distinguished for being the Pha-
raoh that would not let Moses and his people go.

While at Korosko, on the morning of the 5th, we
were again surprised by an early visit from the Gover-
nor of Derr, who had arrived there the previous even-
ing. We endeavored to make him as comfortable at
our breakfast table as he had made us under the syca-
more tree.
