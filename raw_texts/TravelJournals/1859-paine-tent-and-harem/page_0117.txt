resumes its usual tranquil state among the thirsty plains
below. Never did the element of water become, to
my mind, so important a feature in the economy of na-
ture, as when in juxtaposition with these scorching
sands.

Burckhardt gives the following account of the cata-
ract, which he probably saw at a season when the water
was'higher than at the time we were there:

“The cataract is formed by a part of the stream
only, at most, twenty yards in breadth; its fall is more
rapid, and the noise and foam greater than in any other
place in the Batu el' Hadjar, or than at the cataracts at
Assuan; still, however, it little deserves to be called a
cataract. There are three principal or sloping rocks,
one above the other, over which the water descends
with great velocity. The reports of my guide, and
many other persons, had made me very anxious to see
the second cataract, the water of which, I was told,
‘fell down as if from heaven.’ When, after seeing it, I
reprimanded my guide for his extravagant description,
he replied, ‘ Why, have you seen a ﬁner cataract from
Cairo to Mohass ? ’ ” '

. Although the fall itself has so little of majesty and
grandeur, the desolation of the scene gives it a charac-
ter truly sublime.
I We took with us refreshments from the boat, and
here I, at least, poured out a libation in honor of my
own Green Mountain State, which rose upon my mem-
ory in striking contrast to the surrounding waste.
