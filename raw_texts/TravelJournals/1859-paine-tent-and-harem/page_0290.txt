memories the extraordinary prospect before us, we re-
turned to the plain of the cypress, where we took
another long repose, and then commenced our descent
by a gorge, on the side opposite to the one by which
we had gone up, chosen because the way is shorter.
AWhen we left the plain I had preceded the rest of our
party, with my little guide, and as I came to .the scene
of desolation presented by this bed of a torrent, where
boulders lie one upon another in frightfully insecure
confusion, I felt the impracticabilit—y of taking my friend
in her litter over a pass where each stone, poised upon
another, requires only to have the balance disturbed to
be sent rolling down headlong. But while I was
making my way along with the aid of the boy, who
threaded his course with great dexterity among the
tottering rocks, encouraging my more timid steps, I
heard a rattling of stones behind me, and far back, be- .
held the party of men who were carrying Mrs.
She was swung high between them in her palanquin,
While pioneers were carefully reconnoitering to ﬁnd the
safest places, and trundling down stones that were in
the way. The sight was painful, and I scarcely haz-
arded another look. Great was the thankfulness of our
little party that evening for the success of the day’s
enterprise.
