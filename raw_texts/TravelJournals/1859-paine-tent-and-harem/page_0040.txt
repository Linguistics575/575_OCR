all retain the position ﬁrst taken; there is no sign of
life or animation, and the thought of the joyousness or
hilarity that would characterize an assembly of French
or Americans has never come into the minds of this

A robe of some woollen stuff, lined with fur, long
and easy, thrown open in front, is very much worn by
middle-aged and old Turks and Armenians, and adds
much to the usual dignity of the walk and bearing of
the higher classes. It is in this dress that they are
most frequently seen at the numerous cafés, where, re-
clining on mats in balconies and courts, smoking chi-
bouques and nargilés, or playing With a string of large
beads, that are forever in the hand, they present envia-
ble tableaux of contentment.

Animated scenes of discord are sometimes witnessed
in the streets, among the lower classes of Turkish and
Greek women, who occasionally raise their. shrill, sharp
voices to such a pitch aspto startle and stun one.

In some of the more quiet and retired streets, away
from the danger of being crushed to which they would
be exposed in the crowded marts, the wretched mendi-
cants are occasionally seen, seated under some high
wall, and the passenger is arrested by the extended
hand or muttered plea of these pitiable objects, who
are not, indeed, very numerous, and are usually blind
or maimed. To the praise of the humane Turk, it
should be‘ added, that he seldom if ever passes without
dropping an alms into the withered hand.
