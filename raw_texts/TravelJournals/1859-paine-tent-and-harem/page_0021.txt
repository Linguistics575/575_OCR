pair of goggle eyes to be peering from beneath the
well-executed folds of white or gray stone. Those
erected for women are decorated with wreaths or
bunches of ﬂowers. Both kinds have inscriptions, and
are often colored and highly gilded. Sometimes they
are of a bright azure blue, richly decorated with gilt,
and extremely beautiful.

Looking over this sombre grove of cypress at the
foot of the declivity to which it stretches, one beholds
the arsenal for the tr00ps, and the parade ground, always
gay with red fezes, where the well-dressed soldier
might be seen from an early hour of the morning until
night going through the drill to the monotonous, un-
ceasing sounds of the ﬁfe and drum, which, even at the
distance at which our room was situated, rang in our
ears quite too distinctly.

Near to the arsenal was the Custom-house, jutting
out into the Golden Hem; and amidst the slender,
gracefully pointed kdiks, with one, two or three pairs
of cars, which is the commoii number—looking at the
distance from which we saw them like schools of large
ﬁsh—might often be seen the larger and more beautiful
Mile of some Pacha, his head and shoulders just visi-
ble above the sides of the little boat in which he sate
ensconced upon his rug and cushions, the four, six, eight
or ten oarsmen, all white except the red head, pulling
with all their might, while the fairy-like object glides
swiftly up to the steps of the Custom-house.
