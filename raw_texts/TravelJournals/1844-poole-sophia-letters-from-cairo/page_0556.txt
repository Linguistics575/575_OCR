their performance. Another group of dancers,
from perhaps ﬁfteen to eighteen ymrs of age,
dressed uniformly in European plaid silks, amused
the spectators in much the same manner. The
movements of the feet, which appear to be the last ,
considered in the Turkish dance, consisted of three
steps and a hop. These girls were succeeded by
two ’A’lmehs, the ﬁrst Arab singers of Egypt; and '
the band struck up some beautiful Arab airs ; but
on that evening the ’A‘lmehs did not sing; they
only danced in the Arab manner, for which per-
formance they are also celebrated as the ﬁrst of
their day. The Arab dance has been suﬂiciently
described by many travellers, therefore I need only
remark that it is extremely disgusting.

After the performance of the ’A’lmehs, nearlyall
the European ladies partook of coffee and sherbet,
and took their leave. I was among those who re-
mained, intending to pass at least the following
day and night. About eight others, whose ar-
riages did not arrive, remained also, to pass the
night.
