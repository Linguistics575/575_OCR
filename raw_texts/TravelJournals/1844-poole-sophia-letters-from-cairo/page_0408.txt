was answered “ No :” but about a minute after, the boy,
trembling, and seeming much frightened, said, “ I see a man
sweeping the groun .” “ When he has done sweeping,”
said the magician, “ tell me.” Presently the boy said, “ He

The boy did as he was desired; and immediately said, “ I
see a great many soldiers, with their tents: they have pitched
their tents.” He was then told to order that the soldiers
