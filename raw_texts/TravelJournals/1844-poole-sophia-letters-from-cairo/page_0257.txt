to forget the heat, the poor little sparrows would

this intense heat; and they congregate round their
food and water on the terrace, looking so pitiable
during a hot wind, that we should like to transport
them to England. There, however, I am afraid
they would not tenant the houses so fmrlessly of
harm as they do in Egypt. Here is no wanton
cruelty: a great deal of apathy with regard to
snﬁ'ering is apparent in the character of the people 3
but I do not think the Arabs, in general, ever
inﬂict an intentional injury.
