Between the cultivable land and the mountains,
there generally intervenes a desert space, too high
to be inundated. This tract partly consists of sand
and pebbles, covering a bed of rock, and partly of
drifted sand which has encroached on the cultivable
soil. In some places, this desert space is two or
three miles in width.

The extent of the cultivated land in Egypt, my
brother calculates to be equal to rather more than
one square degree and a half: in other words 5,500
square geographical miles.‘ This is less than half
the extent of the land which is comprised within
the conﬁnes of the desert; for many parts within
the limits of the cultivable land are too high to be
inundated, and consequently are not cultivated ;
and other parts, particularly in Lower Egypt, are
occupied by lakes, or marshes, or drifted sand.
Allowance also must be made for the space which
is occupied by towns and villages, the river,
canals, &c. Lower Egypt comprises about the

* He made this calculation from a list of all the towns and
villages in Egypt, and the extent of cultivated land belong-
ing to each. This list is appended to De Sacy's “ Abd Al-

The estimate of M. Mengin shows that in 1821 the extent
of the cultivated land was much less; but since that pe-
riod, considerable tracts of waste land have been rendered
fertile.
