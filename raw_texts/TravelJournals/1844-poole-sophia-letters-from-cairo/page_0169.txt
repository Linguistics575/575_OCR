’citadel. Within this is a steep and narrow road,
partly cut through the rock; so steep, that in some
parts steps are cut to render the ascent and descent
less difﬁcult than it would otherwise be for the
horses and camels, 8:0. This conﬁned road was the
chief scene of the massacre of the Memlooks in the
year 1811. I may perhaps have something to say,
on a future occasion, respecting that tragedy.

A great part of the interior of the citadel is ob-
structed by ruins and rubbish, and there are many
dwelling-houses and some shops within it. The
most remarkable monument that it contains is a
great mosque, built by the Sultan Ibn-Kala’-oon, in
the early 'part of the eighth century after the
Flight (or the fourteenth of our era). It is in a
ruinous state, and no longer used as a place of
worship. It consists of porticoes, surrounding a
square court.

On the north-west of this mosque, stood, about
twelve or thirteen years ago, a noble ruin—an old
palace, commonly called Kasr Yoosuf, or Deewén
Yoosuf, and believed to have been the palace of
Yoosuf Saléh-ed-Deen; but erroneously. European
travellers adopted the same Opinion, and called it
“ Joseph’s Hall.” My brother informs me, on the
authority of El-Makreezee, that this noble struc-
ture .was built by the prince before-mentioned!
