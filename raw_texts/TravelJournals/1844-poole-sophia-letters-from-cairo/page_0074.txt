from Thebes to the same point. The difference in
latitude between the cataracts and the metrOpolis is
six degrees, or 360 geographical miles; and the
distance from the latter point to the sea, in a
straight line, is rather more than ninety miles.
The width of the valley is in few parts more than
eight or ten miles; and generally less than that.
The width of that part of Lower Egypt which
constituted the ancient Delta, is about 120 miles
from east to west. '

The whole of the fertile country is very ﬂat; but
the lands in the vicinity of the river are rather
higher than those which are more remote. This
has been supposed to result from a greater deposit
of mud upon the former; which, however, cannot
be the case, for it is observed that the ﬁelds near
the river are generally above the reach of the inun-
dation, while those towards the mountains are abun-
dantly overﬂowed; but while the latter yield but
one crop, the former are cultivated throughout the
whole year; and it is the constant cultivation and
frequent watering (which is done by artiﬁcial
means) that so considerably raise the soil; not so
much by the deposit of mud left by the water, as by
the accumulation of stubble and manure. The
cultivable soil throughout Egypt is free from
stones, excepting in parts immediately adjacent to
the desert. It almost everywhere abounds with
nitre.
