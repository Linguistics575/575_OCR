After dinner Nezleh Hanum led the way to a
room adjoining the saloon in which we had dined t
and, taking her seat in the centre of the upper end,
she desired that all the ladies might be seated.
The divan was a very miserable one, being awk-
wardly high, and sleping downwards towards the
front ; consequently the Europeans were either
half seated, and slipping forward, .or drew their
feet upon the divan. Neither manner, we were
led to suppose, entirely satisﬁed her Highness, as a
lady who said that she was deputed by her, inquired
whether those ladies would sit in such positions in
the presence of their own sovereigns I An English
lady sharply replied, “ No; but they would have
chairs to sit upon, and not so unsuitable a, divan.”
A lady, however, who sat near her Highness du-
ring the whole of the ﬁrst evening, asserts, that the
question thus put to the European ladies was un.
authorized, and appears to have arisen from some
mistake: that, on the contrary, Nesleh Hanuln
desired that they might consider themselves at
home; that all ceremony might be dismissed; that
she considered the younger ladies as her children,
and the elder ones as her sisters 2 and she requested
that her feelings and wishes might be interpreted:
but they were not: thus afaJse impression existed.
