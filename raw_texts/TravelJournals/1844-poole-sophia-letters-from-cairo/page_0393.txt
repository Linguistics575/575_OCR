the Eastern manner of bathing is highly salubrious,
from its powerful eﬂ‘ect upon the skin.

When the Operation was completed, I was en-
veloped in a dry piece of drapery, similar to the
bathing-dress, and conducted to the reposing-room,

'where I was rubbed and dressed, and left to take

rest and refreshment, and to reﬂect upon the strange
scene which I had witnessed. I wish I could say
that there are no drawbacks to the enjoyment of
the luxury I have described; but the eyes and ears
of an Englishwoman must be closed in the public
bath in Egypt before she can fairly enjoy the satis-
faction it affords; for besides the very foreign scenes
which cannot fail to shock her feelings of propriety,
the cries of the children are deafening and incessant.
The perfection of Eastern bathing is therefore rather
to be enjoyed in a private bath, with the attendance
of a practised vellaneh. .
