instructors as in the rearing and educating of their chil-
dren. In matters of the most trivial nature, religions
precedents direct their management of the young. One
of the ﬁrst duties is, to wrap the new-born child in clean
white linen, or in linen of some other colour; but not
yellow. After this, some person [not a female] should
pronounce the adan“ in the ear of the infant, because
the Prophet did so in the ear of El-Hasan when F stimeh
gave birth to him; or he should pronounce the adan in
the right ear, and the ilsameh (which is nearly the same)
in the left?

It was formerly a custom of many of the Arabs, and
perhaps is still among some, for the father to give a feast
to his friends on seven successive days after the birth of
' a son; but that of a daughter was observed with less
rejoicing. The general modern custom is, to give an
entertainment only on the seventh day, which is called
“ Yom-es-Subooa." On this occasion, the mother,
having left her bed, receives her guests; the child is
exhibited to them; and they give presents of gold or
silver coins, which are generally used to decorate the
infant’s headdress. The father entertains his friends in
the evening. .

On this day, or on the fourteenth, twenty-ﬁrst,
twentyeighth, or thirty-ﬁfth day after the birth, several
religious ceremonies are required to be performed; but

rets) of the m ues. It is as follows :-—“ God is most_ great! ” (four
times). “ I testi that there is no deity but God!” (twice). “ l tes-
tify that Mohammad is God's A le 1 ” (twice). “ Come to prayer! ”
- (twice). “ me to security I ” twice). “ God is must great! ’ (twice).
“ There is no deity but God I ”
