Rasheed, rendered himself an absolute prince.
Immediately upon hearing of the distracted state
of aﬂiﬁrs in Egypt, El-Mo’ezz sent thither a
numerous army, and secured to himself, without
the least opposition, the possession of that country.
The city of El—Kahireh, or Cairo, which his
general Gdhar founded, became the residence of
El-Mo’ezz and his successors. The title of “ kha-
leefe ,” as applied to a Muslim sovereign, signiﬁes
the legitimate successor of the Prophet, and, con-
sequently, the head of the Muslim religion: the
Fawatim, therefore, by assuming that title, ex-
cluded the prince; of the race of El-’Abbas from
the honour of being prayed for in the mosques of
Egypt, considering that as their own prerogative.
The period of their sway was most eventful: it
was most remarkable for the horrid impiety and
tyranny of El-Hakim, the seven years’ famine in
the reign of El-Mustansir (a wise and prudent
prince, who reigned sixty years), and the burning
of El-Fustat, under El-’A’did, the last of the
Few atim. This dynasty, which consisted of eleven
khaleefehs (besides the three predecessors of El-
Mo’ezz), lasted until the year of the Flight 567
(A.D. 1171).

The Fawatim were succeeded by the Eiyoobee-
yeh, or sultdns of the race of Eiyoob, who were a
Kurd family. The ﬁrst of these was the renowned
Salah-ed-Deen (the Saladin of European historians).
