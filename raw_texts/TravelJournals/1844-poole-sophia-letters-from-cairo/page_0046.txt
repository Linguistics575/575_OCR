N eith; the most splendid being that of Bubastis,
and the next, that of Busiris, both in Lower
Egypt. That of Sais was called “ the festival of
burning lamps,” because, on the occasion of its
celebration, the houses in that city, and throughout
all Egypt, were illuminated by lamps hung around
them. '

I mentioned that the boat we had been promised
at the Mahmoodeeyeh had conveyed a party towards
the scene of a festival ; and you may be surprised
to hear that the manners of the modern Egyptians
are not wholly different from those of the ancient
Alexandrians, who ﬂocked to the licentious festivals
celebrated at Canopus in honour of the god Serapis.
Innumerable boats covered the canal by night as
well as by day, conveying pilgrims of both sexes,
dancing, singing, and drinking, and availing them-
selves in every way of the religious licence afforded
them. So, in the present day, vast numbers of the
male inhabitants of the metropolis of Egypt, and
persons from other parts, with numerous courtesans,
repair to the festivals celebrated in commemoration
of the birth of the seyyid ' Ahmad El-Bedawee (a
celebrated Muslim saint), at Tanta, in the Delta,
where swarms of dancing-girls and singers contri-
bute to their amusement, and where, I am told,
brandy is drunk almost as freely as coffee.

.* Seyyid is a title given to the descendants of the Prophet.
