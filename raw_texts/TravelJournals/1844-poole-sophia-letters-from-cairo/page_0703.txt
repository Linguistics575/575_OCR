singer.

In the houses of the wealthy, the vocal and instru-
mental performers were usually (as is the case in many
houses in the present age) domestic female slaves, well

In the work before us, these slaves are commonly de-

instrumental performers. Of the hired performers any
further mention is not here required; but of the
slaves and free ladies who supplied their place a few
