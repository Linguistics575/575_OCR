From the landing-place at Boolak to the nearest
gates of the metropolis, the distance is a little more
than one mile. The southern road leads to the
Esbekeeyeh and the Frank quarters, and the
northern road leads (but not in a straight course)
to the gate called Bab El-Hadeed, at the north-
West angle of the city. At a short distance from
this gate, it passed by a high mound of rubbish,
upon which was a round tower, with a telegraph.
This tower commanded a magniﬁcent View of the
metropolis, the citadel, and Mount Mnkattam.

The area which the metropolis occupies is about
three square miles. Its extreme length is three
miles, and its extreme breadth one and a half.
The pepulation is about 240,000. Some tra-
vellers (judging by the narrowness of its streets,
and from the crowds that are met in the great
thoroughfares), have represented Cairo as a
close, overpeopled city; and have attributed
to this supposed closeness the origin and spread
of those epidemic diseases with which it has been
visited: but the case is far otherwise; it is a
less close or crowded city than London or Paris,
or perhaps any European metropolis. For a po-‘
pulation of 248,000 inhabitants, the space of three
square miles is certainly very ample. The streets
are made narrow for the sake of shade, but most of
the houses are large enough for twice as many
