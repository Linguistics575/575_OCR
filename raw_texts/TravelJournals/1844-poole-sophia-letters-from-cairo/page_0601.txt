of the pearls under the threshold of his door, and
informed the superintendant of police that there
was strong reason for believing that he possessed
some of the lost jewels, adding, that he had been
observed scraping the earth at his door in a. sus-
picious manner. The secreted pearls were found,
and the donkey-driver was arrested and bastinaded;
but no confession was elicited from him, for the
poor fellow had nothing to disclose. In the mean-
time the informers took no care to avoid detection;
upon which a shrewd fellow proposed that the!
should be all bastinaded. They were immediately
seized, and while under the corbag they all pleaded
guilty, and readily criminated each other. Thus
was the poor man revenged, and his innocence
asserted; but that was not suﬁcient compensation
for the many cruel lashes which had swollen his
feet, and disabled him from following his usual
avocations. _

to me :—

A woman, with a basket on her head, was stoop-
ing to drink, balancing her burden cleverly, as all
the Easterns do, and drinking from, a rivulet by
ﬁlling repeatedly her right hand. Another wo-
man lifted the basket from her head without her
knowledge, and placing it on her own, held it with
her left hand, while she, too, drank from her right.
