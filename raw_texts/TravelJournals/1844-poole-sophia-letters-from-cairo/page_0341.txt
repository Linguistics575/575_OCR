slightly inclining inwards, containing, or covering
the sepulchral chamber, and with a ﬂat‘top, was ﬁrst

the former, with its exterior sides similarly inclined,
and its top 'ﬂat, was raised around. Next, another

structure, j; upon the latter. After this manner,
the building probably continued to increase (like
the royal tombs at Thebes) as long as the founder
reigned. The structure was ﬁnished, as Herodotus.
