manner; and the result was the same. The experiment often
entirely fails; but when the boy employed is right in one
case, he generallyis so inall: when he gives, at ﬁrst, an
account altogether wrong, the magician usually dismisses
him at once, saying that he is too old. The perfumes, or
excited imagination, or fear, may be supposed to aﬁ'ect the
vision of the boy who describes objects as appearing to him
in the ink; but, if so, why does he see exactly what is
required, and objects of which he can have had no previous
particular notion ? Neither I nor others have been able to
discover any clue by which to penetrate the mystery; and if
the reader be alike unable to give the solution, I h0pe that

performances were effected by means of pictures and a concave mirror 5
and that the images of the former were reﬂected from the surface of the
mirror. and received on a cloud of smoke under the eyes of the boy.
This, however, I cannot admit; because such means could not have
been employed without my perceiving them; nor would the images be
reversed (unless the pictures were so) by being reﬂected from the sur-
face of a mirror, and received upon a second surface; for the boy was
looking down upon the palm of his hand, so that an image could not be
formed upon the smoke (which was copious, but not dense) between
his eye and the supposed mirror.
