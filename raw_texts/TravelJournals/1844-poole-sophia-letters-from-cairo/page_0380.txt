162 THE ENGLISHWOMAN IN EGYPT.

LETTER XXVIII.

March, 1844.
MY DEAR FRIEND,

You may have heard of a famous mai-
g'ician in this famous city of Cairo, who, though
not supposed to be possessed of art equal to that of
Pharaoh’s wise men and sorcerers, has perplexed
and confounded several of the most intelligent tra-
vellers, by feats very nearly resembling that per-
formed by the Witch of Endor at the request of
Saul. Having inscribed a .magic square upon the
palm of the right hand of any young boy or girl,
and poured into the centre of it a little pool of ink,
he pretends by means of the repetition of certain
invocations to two spirits, and by burning some
small strips of paper inscribed with similar invo-
cations, in a chaﬁng-dish containing live coals
sprinkled with frankincense and coriander-seed, or
other perfume, to make the boy see in this pool
of ink the image-of any per-son, living or dead,
called for by his employer. My brother has fully
described his performances as witnessed by himself
and several other travellers more. than ten years
