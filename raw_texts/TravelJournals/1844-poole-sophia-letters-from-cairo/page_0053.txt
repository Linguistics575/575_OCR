m unanimous m EGYPT. 63

We shirtly aﬁer arrived at Beulah, the principal
port of Cairo, and with our arrival came the ms
cessity that I and my sister-in-law should equip
ourselves in Eastern costume. There was no small
difﬁculty in; this ceranony, and when completed, it
was stiﬂing- to adegnee not to be forgotten. Ima-
gine the face covered. closer by a muslin veil,
double at the umpart, the eym only uncovered,
and over adm of coloured silk an overwhelming
covering of black silk, utending, in my idea, in
every dirwtim; so that, having nothing free but my
eyes, I loom wiﬁ dismy at the high. bank I must
climb, and! the donkey I must mount, which was
waiting for me at the su—it. Nothing can be
more awkward! and uncomﬁartable than. th'm rid-
ing dresa;.ml.if'1-had any chance of attaining
my object without assuming it, I shsuld never adopt
it; but hEhglish. costume Ishould not gain ad-
mittance into. many hamms: besides, the know-
ledge that a. Muslim believw a. curse to rest on the
“ scerand the'scen,” makes one anxious not to.- ex-
pose passersyhy to what they would deem a misfor-
tune, or ourselves tor their Mediation.

My brother, in his ‘ Modem Egyptians; has
represented the manner in which the habarah is
worn by the native ladies of Egpt. The Turkish
ladies close it in: front, esteeming' it improper to
show the colour of the sehleh or téb beneath.
