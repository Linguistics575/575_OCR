descended. The whole aspect of this second pro-
cession was the same as that of the ﬁrst, excepting
that those most nearly concerned looked as though
they had passed through a painful ordeal.

Intending to return on that day (Saturday) to
spend Sunday at home, and to see my dear ones,
and ﬁnding my kind friend in the same mind, we
both prepared for departure, as soon as the brides
had repassed; and, now at home, I must tell you
of the entertainment the Pasha gave his male
guests, and of the out-door fantasia. By the way,
this word fantasia is one of the most useful of all
words here; every decoration, however applied,
every entertainment, musical or otherwise, is styled
a fantasia.

Mohammad ’Alee Pasha entertained a different
select dinner-party on the. several days of the fee-
tivity. Among the persons invited by him were
the consuls, and many of the Eumpeau travellers
and residents in Egypt. On one day the principal
fUlama dined with him; and in the evening, after
dinner, he led these grave and digniﬁed personages
into an apartment which had been ﬁtted up as a
theatre, to witness there the performances of a
company of European actors] It ,was the ﬁrst
time, they say, that any of them had been present
at such a scene; and we may reckon their adven.
tare among the greatest of all the European inno-
vations which occurred during the festivities.
