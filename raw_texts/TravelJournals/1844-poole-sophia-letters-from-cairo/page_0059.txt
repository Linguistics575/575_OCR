The funerals that pass are very numerous; but
other spectacles that I see from my windows aﬂ'ord
various and endless entertainment, and make me
long to look into the houses of this most curious
city, as well as into the streets and roads. After
much consideration, however, I have determined to
defer my intended visits to the hareems of the
great, until I shall have acquired some little know-
ledge of Arabic; for although Turkish is the lan-
guage usually spoken in those hareems, Arabic is
generally understood by the inmates, and as the
latter is the common language of Egypt, some
knowledge of it is indispensable to me.

But our ﬁrst object has been to ﬁnd a comfort-
able dwelling; and notwithstanding the kind assist-
ance of numerous friends, my brother has ex-
perienced great difﬁculty in attaining this object.
The friendly attention that has been shown to us
all is most highly gratifying; and I have already
had some experience of the manners and usages of
the hareem ; two Syrian ladies having devoted
themselves in the most amiable manner to render
us every possible service.

After having searched for a house here during
a month in vain, we were delighted by the offer of
an exceedingly good one, which appeared in almost
every respect eligible, and in which we are now
residing. But our domestic comfort in this new

abode has been disturbed by a singular trouble.
