little coffee-cups and their exquisite jewelled stands.

and ceilings throughout are painted in good taste:
the arabesque and gilding of the ceilings are chaste

senting generally Turkish Simmer palaces, are
evidences that the artists employed had no knew-
ledge of perspective, yet they are so well arranged
to represent a sort of pannel‘led. wall, the gilding
above and on either side of these paintings is deli.
