carpet spread upon the ground, and there, while coffee is pre.
paring, he usually sits, reading and sealing his despatehes.
He will then enjoy his coffee and pipe, and afterwards return
directly to the palace. This is one of his recreations. In the
hareem, he reads or has books read to him, oramuses himself
by conversing with the abler part of the eunuchs. At other
times he is employed in dictating his history; or in playing
at chess, to which, like most other Orientals, he appears to be
passionately addicted. In fact his active restless temper will

with graver and more important aﬁ'airs, he descends even to
meddling. Nothing is too minute for him. For example, a
young Egyptian Turk, educated in the school of Cairo, now
professor of mathematics, and teacher of the young ofﬁcers
at Alexandria, is compelled every week to give him an exact
account of :the manner in which each of his pupils pursues
his studies. During the period in which he was pushing
forward the preparations necessary for putting his ﬂeet to
sea, a much smaller portion of the day than usual was
devoted to his audiences and ordinary business. Indeed
he would frequently give audience in the arsenal, where
he spent a considerable part of .his time; after which
he used to step into his little elegant state barge, and cause
himself to be rowed out into the harbour among his ships,
to observe the progress of the naval architects and ship-
wrights, and urge them forward by his presence ;and in these
little excursions of business he was sometimes so deeply in-
terested, that he would not return to the palace before twelve
o’clock; thus greatly abridging 'hishonrs of relaxation. The
accidents of the weather never interfere with his resolutions.
'He will sometimes set out on a journey in the midst of a
heavy shower of rain or a storm, which has more than once
«earned him ‘very serious illness. His movements are sudden
