LETTER XI.

March, 1846.
I MENTIONED in my last letter the widow of-
Isma’eel Pasha, whose illness had occasioned so
much uneasiness to Mohammad ’Alee. She is now
convalescent; but the old lady whom I also men-
tioned as being ill at the same time, who was once
his favourite wife, died about a fortnight since.
She had suffered extremely during a period of two
years. On the morning of her death, N ezleh
Hanum was roused by screams which proceeded
from the palace of the invalid, adjoining her own
palace; for the Kasr en Neel is composed of
several distinct mansions, occupied by some of the
elders of the Pasha’s Hareem and their attendants.
It was the funeral cry which had been raised by
the slaves of the dying sufferer while she was yet
alive. Nezleh Hénum went to her chamber,
commanded silence, and directed the use of resto.
ratives, until the object of her solicitude breathed
her last. The shrieks of the immediate attendants
were heard throughout the Kasr, and the death-cry
which went forth from the inmates of the several
palaces was heard at a considerable distance.
