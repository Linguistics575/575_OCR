Then followed the most interesting and touching
act of. the drama. The relations sat nearest to the
corpse, and each of them addressed it in turn,
using every endearing expression that love or;
ﬁiendship could suggest. Each held in her hand
a handkerchief, folded in the form of a bandelet ;_
this was rapidly whirled round at the close of each
address. All apostrophized the deemed; slaves
as well as relations. One cried, “ Have I not
loved thee, and have not mine eyes worshipped
thee ?” Another, “ Thou art young, my heart’s
treasure, my beloved! O! thou art very young to-
lmve thy husband, and thy mother 1” Another, a
slave, cried, “ I have made thy bread; must than
for ever leave thy poor slave? 0, my mistress,
will than no longer eat what my hands may pre-
pare?” Then cried another slave, “ Have I not
cooked fbr thee the choicest dainties? Wilt then
no longer remain with us? Cans't thou leave us
desolate? 01 come back again, my belovedl
My mistress, come back, to thy wretched slave; and
she will prepare for thee sweetmeats with honey
and sugar, and perfumes, and use all her skill to
please thee I” This was said by a very fat old
negro woman. One poor slave fainted several
times, evidently from real affection combined with
fatigue. It was astonishing that they could endure
so much excitement and exertion of mind and
body.
