134 THE mansnwonun m nerrr.

retired from the neighbourhood of El—Maks ; form-
ing, by the deposit of soil during the successive
seasons of the inundation, the wide plain upon
which the town of Boolak is situated. Boolak was
founded in the year of the Flight 713 (A.D. 1313-
14); and the island which is named after it
(Gezeeret Boolak) was formed about the same
period. .

Boolak is about a mile in length, and half a mile
is the measure of its greatest breadth. It con-
tains about 20,000 inhabitants. Its houses, streets,
and shops, &c., are like those of the metr0polis, of
which I hope to give you a description in my next
letter. Of the mosques of Boolatk, the large one
called the Simineeyeh, and that of Abu-l-’Elé, are
the most remarkable; the ﬁrst for its size, the
latter for the beauty of its mad’neh, or menaret.
The principal manufactories are those of cotton
and linen cloths, and of striped silks of the same
kind as the Syrian and Indian. Many Franks
ﬁnd employment in them. A. printing-ofﬁce has
also been established at Boolak by the present
Viceroy. Many works on military and naval tac-
tics, and others on Arabic grammar, poetry, letter-
writing, geometry, astronomy, surgery, &c., have
issued from this press. The printing-ofﬁce con-
tains several lithographic presses, which are used
for printing proclamations, tables illustrative of
military and naval tactics, &c.
