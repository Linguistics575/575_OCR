the hurry and confusion attending such a scene, as they fell
they were buried among the earth thrown up from the re-
maining excavations. When this canal was ﬁnished, which
was eﬂ'ected in seven months, 30,000 fellow-creatures were
found to have been destroyed in this most barbarous ex-
penditure of human power.

At the termination at Atﬁeh a sluice is erected to admit
the Nile during its rise, and being closed on its retiring, the
water is preserved for the purposes of navigation and irriga-
tion. Alexandria is also supplied with water from this canal.
The average breadth of this canal is about 220 feet, and the
depth perhaps about 7; feet, very serpentine at the com-
mencement at Mahmoodeyeh, but gradually improving as
you proceed. The navigation on this canal is a great source
of revenue to the Pasha, as each kanjah pays a toll both going
and returning, the original outlay having been very incon-
siderable.

Besides the Mahmoodeyeh canal, many other canals have
been made by direction of Mohammad ’Alee. The canal of
Tanta, in the Delta, is about thirty miles long and about four
yards wide; it has four sluices at Vames, and preserves its
water throughout the year. The canal of Bouhyeh, on the
Damietta branch of the Nile, is about thirty-ﬁve miles long
and four yards wide. The canal of Bahyreh, on the Rosetta
branch of the Nile, 18 nearly sixty miles long, and about ﬁve
yards wide. Smaller canals have been excavated to a very
considerable extent.

These canals, except that of Mahmoodeyeh, which 1s prin-
cipally for navigation, are used chieﬂy for irrigation, the
water being raised from them mostly by water-wheela of
which there are more than 50,000 in Lower Egypt, and of
these about 38,000 have been introduced under the direction
of Mohammad ’A lee. Each water-wheel is worked for the
