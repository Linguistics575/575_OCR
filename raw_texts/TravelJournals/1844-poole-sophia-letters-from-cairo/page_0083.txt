There arises from the waters of the ﬁelds a con-

in Lower Egypt during the hot season, at noon, and in the
shade, is from 90° to 100°; in Upper Egypt, from 100° to
110°; and in Nubia, from 110° to 120°, and even 130°,

sand and exposed to the sun, the thermometer often rises to
150° or more. The temperature of Lower Egypt in the
depth of winter is from 50° to 60".
