APPENDIX. 171

[Cur-an; very rarely the whole book. Parents are in-
deed recommended to withhold from their daughters some
portions of the Igor-an; to teach them the Soorat en-
N oor [or 24th chapter], and keep from them the Soorat
Yoosuf [12th chapter]; on account of the story of Ze-
leekha and Yoosuf in the latter, and the prohibitions and
threats and mention of punishments contained in the
former!

N eedle-work is not so rarely, but yet not generally,
taught to Arab girls: the spindle frequently employs
those of the poorer classes; and some of them learn to
weave. The daughters of persons of the middle and
higher ranks are often instructed in the art of em-
broidery, and in other ornamental work, which are taught
in schools and in private houses. Singing, and playing
upon the lute, which were formerly not uncommon female
accomplishments among the wealthy Arabs, are now
almost exclusively conﬁned, like dancing, to professional
performers and a few of the slaves in the hareems of the
great: it is very seldom now that any musical instrument
is seen in the hand of an Arab lady, excepting a kind of
drum called darabukkeh, and a tar (or tambourine),
which are found in many hareems, and are beaten with
the ﬁngers.1' Some care, however, is bestowed by the
ladies in teaching their daughters what they consider an
elegant gait and carriage, as well as various alluring and

. voluptuous arts with which to increase the attachment of

their future husbands.
