hand a silver rod: about twenty slaves surround
her; ten throw the water, while others follow them

It is very grievous that the women in general
are merely instructed in handiwork. But I must
not speak slightingly of their embroidery; for it is
extremely beautifulâ€”as superior as it is' unlike to
any fancy-work practised in England. Taste of a
very remarkable kind is displayed in its execution;
and similar, in many respects, to that exhibited in
the most elaborate decorations of Arabian architec-
ture; but its singular beauty is in some measure
produced, where colours are employed, by the plan
of often taking the colours at random.
