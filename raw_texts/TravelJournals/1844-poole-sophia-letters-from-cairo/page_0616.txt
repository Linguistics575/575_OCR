apparel) and the face-veil. It is now generally made
of white calico, but a similar covering of black silk for
the married, and of white silk for the unmarried, is now
worn by females of the higher and middle classes, and is
called a “ habarah.” .

It appears that the kind of face-veil mentioned in the
same passage (in Arabic, “ kinda ”) is a piece of muslin,
about a yard or more in length, and somewhat less in
,width, a portion of which is placed over the head, he-
neath the izar, the rest hanging down in front, to the
waist, or thereabout, and entirely concealing the face.
I have often seen Arab women, particularly those of the
Wahhabees, wearing veils of this kind composed of
printed muslin, completely concealing their features, yet
of suﬁciently loose fabric to admit of their seeing their
way. But the more common kind of Arab face-veil is a
long strip of white muslin, or of a kind of black crape,
covering the whole of the face excepting the eyes, and
reaching nearly to the feet. It is suspended at the tap
by a narrow band, which passes up the forehead, and
which is sewed, as are also the two upper corners of the
veil, to a band that is tied round the head. This veil is
called “ burko’.” The black kind is often ornamented
with gold coins, false pearls, &c., attached to the upper
part. It is not so genteel as the white veil, unless for a
lady in mourning.
