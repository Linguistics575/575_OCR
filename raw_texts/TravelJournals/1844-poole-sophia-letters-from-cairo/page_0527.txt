clothed, ﬁrst danced about the arena with a drawn
sword.’ The player who personated his wife, who
was a man in female attire, and to whom I must

with a swaggering gait, and desired him to give
her his sword, which he refusing to do, she scolded

' and screamed, beating her face, and ' then his, and

thus obtained what she wanted. In' the same
manner she obliged him to strip 03' almost every
article of his clothing one by one, and at last, en»
raged by her conduct, he beat her till she died. This
foolish farce, I thought, might probably be too ap-

in cases of this kind among the Turks, the husband
is the slave of his wife. After this, a man with a
lighted torch to represent a- tail, ran round upon
his hands and knees several times, within the ring.

did not partake of the repeat with them.

“ The performances of the second night, and the
ﬁreworks, were so little diﬁ'erent from those of the
