148 THE anemsnwouan m nerr'r.

Cairo. It consists of a series of short lanes, with
several turnings, and has four entrances from dif-
ferent quarters. The shops in thiskhan are mostly
occupied by Turks, who deal in ready-made clothes
and other articles of dress, together with arms of
various kinds, the small prayer-carpets used by the
Muslims, and other commodities. Public auctions
are held there (as in many other markets in Cairo)
twice in the week, on Monday and Thursday, on
which occasions the khan is so crowded, that, in
some parts, it is difﬁcult for a passenger to push
his way through. The sale begins early in the
morning, and lasts .till the noon-prayers. Clothes
(old as well as new), shawls, arms, pipes, and
a variety of other goods, are offered for sale in
this manner by brokers, who carry them up and
down the market. Several water-carriers, each
with a goat-skin of water on his back, and a brass '
cup for the use of any one who would drink, attend
on these occasions. Sherbet of raisins, and bread
(in round, ﬂat cakes), with other eatables, are also
cried up and down the market; and on every
auction day, several real or pretended idiots, with
a distressing number of other beggars, frequent the
khan.

Another of the principal khans of Cairo is that
called the Kamzawee, which is the principal market
of the drapers and silk-mercers.

There are few other khdns in Cairo, or rather
