that part of the town in which most of the Franks reside.
The charges being here stated, and committed to writing, he
conducts them to the ‘ Zzibit,’ or chief magistrate of the po-
lice of the metrOpolis. The Zzibit, having heard the case,
sends the accused for trial to the Deewan el-Khideewee.*
When a person denies the offence with which he is charged,
and there is not suﬂicient evidence to convict him, but some
ground of suspicion, he is generally bastinaded, in order to
induce him to confess; and then, if not before, when the
crime is not of a nature that renders him obnoxious to a very
heavy punishment, be, if guilty, admits it. A thief, after
this discipline, generally confesses, “ ‘ The devil seduced me,
and I took it.’ ” The punishment of the convicts is regulated
by a. system of arbitrary, but lenient and wise, policy: it
usually consists in their being compelled to labour, for a
scanty sustenance, in some of the public works; such as the
removal of rubbish, digging canals, 85c. ; and sometimes the
army is recruited with able-bodied young men convicted of
petty offences. The Pasha is, however, very severe in pu-
nishing thefts, &c., committed against himself :—-—death is the
usual penalty in such cases.

There are several inferior councils for conducting the
affairs of different departments of the administration. The
principal of these are the following—1. The Council of De-
liberation. The members of this and of the other similar
councils are chosen by the Pasha, for their talents or other
qualiﬁcations; and consequently his will and interest sway
them in all their decisions. They are his instruments, and

* A very arbitrary power is often exercised in this and similar courts,
and the proceedings are conducted with little decorum. Many Turkish
oﬂicers, even of the highest rank, make use of language far too disgust-

ing to be mentioned towards persons brought before them for judgment
and towards those who appeal to them for justice.
