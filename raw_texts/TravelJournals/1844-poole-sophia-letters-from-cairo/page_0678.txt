camel’s ﬂesh is allowed. The latter, however, being of
a coarse nature, is never eaten when any other meat can
,be obtained, excepting by persons of the lower classes,
and by Arabs of the desert. Of ﬁsh, almost every kind
is eaten (excepting shell-ﬁsh), usually fried in oil :. of
game, little; partly in consequence of frequent doubt
whether it have been lawfully killed. The diet consists,
in a great measure, of vegetables, and includes a large
variety of pastry. A very common kind of pastry is a
pancake, which is made very thin, and folded over several
times like a napkin ; it is saturated with butter, and ge-
nerally sweetened with honey or sugar; as is also another
common kind, which somewhat resembles vermicelli.

The usual beverage at meals is water, which is drunk
from cooling, porous, earthen bottles, or from cups of
brass or other metal: but in the houses of the wealthy,
sherbet is sometimes served instead of this, in covered
glass cups, each of which contains about three-quarters of
a pint. The sherbet is composed of water made very
sweet with sugar, or with a hard conserve of violets or
roses or mulberries, &c. After every time that a person
drinks, he says, “ Praise be to God; ” and each person
of the company says to him, “ May it beneﬁt: " to which
he replies, “May God beneﬁt thee.” The Arabs drink
little or no water during a meal, but generally take a
large draught immediately after. The .repast is quickly
ﬁnished ; and each person, as soon as he has done, says,
“ Praise be to God,” or “ Praise be to God, the Lord of
all creatures.” He then washes, in the same manner as
before, but more thoroughly ; well lathering his beard,
and rinsing his mouth.
