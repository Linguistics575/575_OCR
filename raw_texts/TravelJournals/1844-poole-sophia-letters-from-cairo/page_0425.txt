ornaments of gold called “ bark.’-’ These are commonly all

but those ofeach stringarepurpaelyplaocdsoasnotexactly

forms of bark are Nos. 1 and 2 of the specimens given
above. At the end of each string is a small gold tube, called
“ masoorah,” about three-eighths of an inch long, or a kind
of gold bead in the form of a cube with a portion cut off
from each angle, called “ habbeh.” Beneath the mascarah
or habbeh is a little ring, to which is most commonly sus-
pended a Turkish gold coin called “ Ruba Feaduklee,”
equivalent to nearly ls. 8d. of our money, and a little more
than half an inch in diameter. Such is the most general
description of safe; but there are more genteel kinds, in
which the habbeh is usually preferred to the masoorah, and
instead of the Ruba Fenduklee is a ﬂat ornament of gold,
called, from its form, “ kummetré," or “ pear.” There are
also other and more approved substitutes for the gold coin;
the most usual of which is called “shiﬁish'eh,” composed of
open gold work, with a pearl in the centre. Some ladies
substitute a little tassel of pearls for the gold coin; or sus-
pend alternatcly pearls and emeralds to the bottom of the
triple strings; and attach a pearl with each of the bark.
The sate. thus composed with pearls is called “ safa loolee.”
Coral beads are also sometimes attached in the same manner
as the pearls—From what has been said above, it appears
that a moderate safa of thirteen .plaits will consist of 39
strings, 351 bark, 39 misoorahs or habbehs, and 39 gold
coins or other ornaments; and that a sofa of twentyaﬁve
plais, with twelve bark to each string, will contain no fewer
than 900 bark, and 75 of each of the other appendages.
The sofa appears to me the prettiest, as well as the most
singular, of all the ornaments worn by the ladies of Egypt.
