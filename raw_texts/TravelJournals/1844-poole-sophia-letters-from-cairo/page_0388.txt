that a discovery of the means employed by the ma-
gician, which were thought to be of a very ingeni-
ous kind, was regarded as an interesting deside-
ratum. That these means were not merely lead-
ing questions, and the like, as a late writer has -
suggested, is evident when we reﬂect that the ma-
gician is not. known to have been even generally
successful on any single occasion since the death of
the interpreter ’Oemdn, and it is not likely that in-
telligent travellers (of whom many might be named)
would have been at a loss for the explanation, if
such means would have suﬂiced.

One further remark I must make on this sub-
ject. If we give to some persons that credit which-
they are believed to deserve, we must admit that
excited imagination, in the child employed as an
agent in the deception, has sometimes produced
images inthe mirrorofink; but these imageshave
been always such as the child empected to see. The
successful performance: have been supposed, by
some, to have been effected by means of mesmer-
ism; and some have attributed them to diabolical
agency. As the grandest discoveries in science
are often the most simple, so what appears to us at
ﬁrst most unaccountable is often capable of the .
most simple solution.
