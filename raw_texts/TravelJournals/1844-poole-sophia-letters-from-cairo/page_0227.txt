LETTER XVII.

April, 1843.
MY DEAR FRIEND,

You will congratulate us on our having
quitted “ the haunted house ;” and you will do so
heartily when I tell you that six families have
succeeded each other in it, in as many weeks, since
our departure. The sixth family was about to
quit immediately when we heard this news; ﬁve
having been driven out by most obstinate persecu-
tions, not only during the nights, but in broad
daylight, of so violent a description, that the win-
dows were all broken in a large upper chamber,
our favourite room. The sixth family suffered
similar annoyances, and also complained that much
of their china was demolished. Like ourselves, no
one has been able to obtain quiet rest in that house,
