the girdle, and composed of diamonds or other precious
stones, which is called “ kiladeh.” Some women form a long
necklace of this kind with Venetian sequins, or Turkish or
Egyptian gold coins.

The ﬁnger-rings (“ khatims”) diﬂ‘er so little from those

in length, are braided with the hair for about a quarter of

silk which is bound round the head, and in this case hang
