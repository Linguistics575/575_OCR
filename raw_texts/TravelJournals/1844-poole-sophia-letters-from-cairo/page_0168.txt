Mr nun FRIEND,

Fnou the city, you must now accompany
me, in imagination, to the citadel. If you could do so
in reality, you would be amply repaid for the
trouble of ascending its steep aeolivities ; not by the
sight of any very remarkable object within its
walls, but by gazing on one of the most striking
and interesting views in the Eastern world. The
citadel (El-Kat’ah) is situated at the south-eastern
extremity of the metmpolis, upon an extensive,
ﬂat-topped, rocky eminence, about 250 feet above
the level of the plain, and near the point of Mount
Mukattam, which completely commands it. It
was founded by Saldh-ed-Deen (the famous Sa-
ladin), in the year of the Flight 572 (A.D. 1176-7);
but not ﬁnished till 604; since which latter period
it has been the usual residence of the sultdns and
governors of Egypt. Before it is a spacious square,
called the Rumeyleh, where a market is held, and
where conjurers, musicians, and storytellers are
often seen, each surrounded by a ring of idlers. !

The Bab el-’Azab is the principal gate of the .
