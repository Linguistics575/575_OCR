The custom of giving presents on the occasion of
paying a visit, or previously, which is of such high an-
tiquity as to be mentioned in the book of Genesisﬁ has
continued to prevail in the East to this day. Presents
of provisions of some kind, wax candles, &c., are sent to
persons about to celebrate any festivity, by those who
are to be his guests: but after paying a mere visit of
ceremony, and on some other occasions, only money is
commonly given‘ to the servants of the person visited.
In either case, the latter is expected to return the com-
pliment on a similar occasion by presents of equal value.
To reject a present generally gives great offence; being
regarded as an insult to him who has offered it. When a
person arrives from a foreign country, he generally
brings some articles of the produce or merchandise of
that country as presents to his friends. Thus, pilgrims
returning from the holy places bring water of Zemzem,
dust from the Pmphet’s tomb, &c., for this purpose.—
Horses, and male and female slaves, are seldom given
but by kings or great men.
