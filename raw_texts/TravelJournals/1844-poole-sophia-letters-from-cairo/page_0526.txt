of the Pasha, dressed in a fantastical manner, and
wearing a high, pointed red cap, gaudily orna-
' mented with tinsel and bells, amused the company
with ridiculous drolleries. He and several other
persons, some of whom were of the meanest and
dirtiest of the people, bore torches. The buﬁ'oon

exhibiting the troubles of a hen-peeked husband.
