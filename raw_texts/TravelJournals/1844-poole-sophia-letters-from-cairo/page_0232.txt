presents itself; but not at home. The chief lady
of a house, to do her guests honour, presents then
with morsels of her own seleetion, with her own
ﬁngers; and in some cases repeats this compliment
frequently. It would be a positive aﬁ’ront to
refuse those; and Iamqnite sure that no English-
woman can so far strain her politeness as to eat as
much as her hostess, in her excessive hospitality,
desires, though the latter sets her a wonderful ex-
ample. I have really seen the ladies of this conn-
try eat as much as should suﬁee hr three or four
moderate meals at one sitting. But to return to
my diﬂiculty. I always found it to be the best
plan to receive readily, for a time, the morsels
which were offered ; and when satisﬁed, to accept
perhaps another, and sometimes two or three ; at
the same time assuring my entertainer, that they
were redundant, but that her viands- were so ex-
tremely well chosen, that I must, after the repast,
inquire who has superintended the cuisine, and
derive from her some information. Thus I re-
moved the imprmsion which was immediately
formed, that the dinner was not dressed agreeably
with my taste: and induced only the remark, that
“ the English eat so much less than the Easterns ;”
accompanied by regret that so little satisﬁed me,
but followed by an expression of pleasure that the
dinner was so agreeable to me.
