We reached the village of Shubra Kheet shortly
after sunset, and as our boatmen recommended that
our boat should be made fast under this place, we re-
mained there until the morning. It was then curious
to see the various occupations of the peasants, and
to observe the lassitude with which they labour.
, During our voyage several poor fellows ﬂoated
towards the boat, sitting as it were upright on
the water, paddling with their feet, and bearing

one on their heads. Their manner of swimming

0n the second day we passed renowned Sais,
and afterwards had a glimpse of the great desert,
and its almost immeasurable sea of sand. Sais was
the ancient capital of the Delta, one of the most
celebrated cities of Egypt, and the reputed birth-
place of Cecrops, who, it is said, led a colony of
Saites to Attica, about 1556 years before the
Christian era, founded Athens, and established
there the worship of Minerva (the Egyptian
Neith), the tutelar goddess of his native city.
