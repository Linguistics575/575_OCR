with the exception of a few apartments, was thrown
open to the public. In the court of the palace,
where twelve chandeliers (two of them very large,
but not handsome) were suspended, and which was
covered over with red tent-cloths, &c., for shade,
musicians, dancing-men, swordsman, and others,
amused the assembled crowds during the day; and
refreshments, consisting of sweetmeats, coffee, shero
bet, &c., were occasionally served to the people in
the public rooms, high and low; for even the
meanest of the people had free access; the Pasha
reserving only -a few rooms for himself and his
friends. But the chief festivities were in the
evening.

“ I spent an hour (says my brother) on the shore
of the lake in the evening of ‘the ﬁrst day, to see
the ﬁreworks. The place was acessively crowded.
There were numerous benches and stools of palm-
sticks, and strips of matting, placed along the
water’s edge, by the kahwegees (or keepers of the
coffee-booths); as soon as a person sat on one of
these, a cup of coﬁ'ee was brought to him, and if he
refused to take it he was not allowed to retain. his
seat, unless he were a person of the higher orders.
Several mesh’als (or cressets) Were stuck in the
ground to light the company; and numbers of men
were going about with cakes, nuts, and various

other eatables, and with sweet drinks and water.
