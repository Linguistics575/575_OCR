hundred women : and sometimes he included four wives
in one contract, and sometimes divorced four at one time,
taking other four in their stead.”I This may perhaps
he an exaggerated statement: but it is certain that the
custom of keeping an unlimited number of concubines
was common among wealthy Muslins in the ﬁrst century
of the Mohammadan era, and has so continued. The
famous author of the work above quoted urges the ex-
ample of Solomon to prove that the possession of numerous
concubines is not inconsistent with piety and good
moral; not considering that God in the beginning made
one male and but one female.

A Muslim may divorce his wife twice, and each
time take her back. This he may do, even against
her wish, during a ﬁxed period, which cannot extend
beyond three months, unless she be mediate, in which
latter case she must wait until the birth of her child
before she will be at liberty to contract a new mar-
riage. During this period the husband is obliged to
maintain her. If he divorce her a third time, or by a
triple sentence, he cannot take her again unless with
her own consent, and by a new contract, and after
another marriage has been consummated between her
and another husband, and this husband also has di-
vorced her.

It is not a common custom, especially among the
middle ranks, for an Arab to have more than one wife at
the same time; but there are few of middle age who
have not had several different wives at diﬁ‘erent periods,
tempted to change by. the facility of divorce. The case
or ’Alee has been mentioned above. Mugheyreh Ibn
