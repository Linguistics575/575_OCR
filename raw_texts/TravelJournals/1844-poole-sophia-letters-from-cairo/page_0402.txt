NOTE BY THE EDITOR.

Tums Series of Letters somewhat abruptly terminates. The
last letter, dated April, 1844, with several others, arrived
from Cairo in May, and were delivered for publication.
Since then, through some accidental circumstances, the
communication has been interrupted. It is thought better
to complete the volume with some illustrative matter, by
way of Appendix, than to run the risk of any further
delay.

August 23, 1344.
