of their lands almost all the private preprietors throughout
Egypt, allotting to each, as a partial compensation, a pension
for life, proportioned 'to the extent and quality of the land
which belonged to him. The farmer has, therefore, nothing
to leave to his children but his hut, and perhaps a few
cattle and some small savings.

The direct taxes on land are proportioned to the natural
advantages of the soil. Their average amount is about 8.9.
per feddsin, which is somewhat less than an English acre.
But the cultivator can never calculate exactly the full
amount of what the government will require of him. The
fellah, to supply the bare necessaries of life, is often obliged

the seed for his land, or obtain it as a loan from the govern-

quantity; a considerable portion being generally stolen by
the persons through whose hands it passes before he receives
it. The oppressions which the peasantry of Egypt endure
from the dishonesty of the Ma—moors and inferior ofﬁcers
are indescribable. It would be scarcely possible for them
to suﬁ'er more, and live.

The Pasha has not only taken possession of the lands of
the private pr0prietors, but he has also thrown into his trea-

The tax upon the palm-trees has been calculated to amount

The income-tax is generally a twelfth or more of a man’s
annual income or salary, when that can beasoertained. The
