The scene was strikingly picturesque and lively.
The ﬁreworks chieﬂy consisted of rockets, which
were discharged one at a time, at short intervals;
80 that they were not very remarkable; but they
had a pretty appearance, issuing from the bosom of
the lake. The seven guns were occasionally ﬁred
one after another.

“ From the lake I proceeded to the palace, push-
ing my way through dense crowds. Numerous
lamps in addition to two large chandeliers, were
hung in the street before the palace; and the street
there was covered over like the court. The court
I found thronged with people, chieﬂy of the lower
classes. A large ring was formed round a group
of dancing-men ; but I could not get near enough
to see them. All the public apartments also were
crowded with persons of every class, and in every
variety of picturesque attire, from the richest to the
meanest. At the door of one room I was stopped
by a sentry, and told that there were only Eu-
ropeans within. I found it convenient to assert
my right to enter, and was admitted. Here were
but a few persons, mostly Greeks, several of whom
were females ; some in the ordinary European
dress, and others in the male costume of the Turks,
which they had put on in the hope of their being
mistaken for boys, as it is uncommon for females in
the East to be in the company of men, or even to
go out at night; but their sex was too evident.
