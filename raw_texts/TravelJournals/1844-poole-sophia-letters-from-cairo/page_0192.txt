206 THE ENGLISHWOMAN IN EGYPT.

LETTER XV.

Cairo, February, 1833.
MY DEAR FRIEND,

You know how much I desired to obtain
access to respectable hareems, as well those of the
highest as those of the middle classes; and now
that my hope has been realized, I ﬁnd that I did
not desire what would disappoint my expectations.
Indeed I have felt exceedingly interested in ob-
serving the manners of the ladies of this country ;
in some cases I have been amused by their famili-
arity, and in many fascinated by the natural grace
of their deportment. I am aware that by descrip-
tion I cannot do them justice, but I will endeavour
to give you faithful pictures of those hareems I
have already seen ; and ﬁrst I must tell you that I
am indebted exceedingly to the kindness of Mrs.
Sieder, the lady of our excellent resident mission-
ary, who has gained the conﬁdence of the most dis-
tinguished hareems in this country, and has given
me some introductions I particularly desired, with-
out any reserve, and in the most ready and friendly
