.76 rm: ENGLISHWOMAN IN EGYPT.

stance was explained to our minds which we had
not before fully understood. On the day before
we desired to remove here, we sent one of our ser-
vants to hire some women, and to superintend the
clearing of the house; and on his arrival there,
the landlady (whose name is Lalah-Zdr, or bed
of tulips) refused him admission, saying, -“ Return
to the Efendee, and say to him that I am baking
cakes in the even of his kitchen, that I may give
them away to-mmow at the tomb of the late
owner of the house, to the poor and needy. This
is a meritorious act ‘for your master’s sake, as well
as for my own, and your master will understand
it.”

Poor woman! it is now evident to us that she
hoped by this act of propitiation to prevent further
annoyance to her tenants, and consequent loss to
herself.

The morning after the conversation I have
related took place, the servants’ report was con-
siderably improved. They had passed, they said,
a comfortable night, and we hoped we might
arrange to remain here, but the following day a
most singular statement awaited us. The door-
keeper, in a tone of considerable alarm, said that
he had been unable to sleep at all; that the ’Efreet
had walked round the gallery all night in clogs !"'
