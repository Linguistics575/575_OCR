which she welcomed several lady-gentlemen visitors,
who were ever and anon turned out by her jealous
and offended husband. The second three was a
representation of a bath, into which so many
claimed admittance that it became impossible to
accommodate one half of them. One applicant
disguised as a Darveesh (in Arabic, Darweesh)
gave no very cleanly reason for requiring the bath ;
the conversation during that evening being amix-
ture of Arabic and Turkish, I was able to under-
stand the drift of the performance. The people
were however so long in the bath, that I and Mrs.
Lieder left them to settle their pretended differ-
ences, and went to bed.

We found the blue silk curtain arranged as on
the previous night. Three mattresses were under
it, and our party would occupy but two; we there-
fore expected company for the night, and were not
disappointed. â€™

I lay awake for some hours, for, in truth,
I was in wretched spirits, and little disposed for
sleep. The trouble of the poor slave was swal-
lowed up in one far more grievous. A eunuch
belonging to one of the great hareems had, in the
evening of the preceding day, snatched from the
head of his mistress a diamond spray. She imme-
diately missed it, and accused him of the theft.
He denied it, but a peasant woman who happened
to be present asserted that she saw him take it.
