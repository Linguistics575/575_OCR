the eastern corner of the north side of a chamber,
which is nineteen feet long, and seventeen feet
broad (see It). This has been called by some
travellers the “ Queen’s Chamber ;” from the sup-
position that the queen of the founder of the
pyramid was buried in it. The roof is formed of
long blocks of stone, leaning against each other.
The height of the chamber, to the commencement
of the roof, is thirteen feet and a half; and to the
summit, about seven feet more. The ﬂoor, sides,
and roof are constructed of the same kind of lime-
stone as the passages. In the eastern end (not in
the middle, but rather to the right) is a high and
narrow recess, ﬁve feet wide at the bottom, but
becoming narrower towards the top, like the sides
of the Grand Passage. It is three feet ﬁve inches
deep. Within it, four feet from the ﬂoor, is the
entrance of a forced passage, four feet wide. At
the commencement it is square, and :smoothly
cut; but further on it becomes irregular; and at
the distance of ﬁfty feet it terminates” at a hollow
space, wider and more irregular than the rest. In
this chamber and forced passage there is little to
detain us. We return to the Grand Passage.
Above the entrance of the horizontal passage
which leads to the chamber above described, is a
