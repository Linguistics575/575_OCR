the massacre of the Mamelukes commenced. They were
adorned, or rather encumbered, with their ﬁnest arms, and
mounted on noble horses; but their numbers, their courage
—all were useless—they were destroyed!”

Such of the Mamelukes as escaped the indiscriminate
massacre within the walls of the castle, were seized and
beheaded; and numbers in the towns and villages, on
the calamity which had befallen their brethren being
made known, shared a like fate. The remnant retired to
Dongola in Nubia; but they were scattered by Ibrahim
Pasha, and from that period the total destruction, or, at least,
the complete subjugation, of the once proud Mamelukes may-
be dated. .

The Wahabees were a Mohammedan sect in Arabia, who
derived their name from Abdu-l-Wahab, a reformer of the
religion of Mohammed, who was born about the end of the
seventeenth century. This religious sect gradually attained
to such a degree of temporal and political power that the
very existence of the Turkish empire was endangered by
them. They conquered Mecca in 1803 and Medina in 1804.
Pilgrimages were stopped. From 1803 to 1809 no great
caravan ventured to cross Arabia. They overrun Syria, and
concluded an alliance with Yiisuf, the rebellious Pasha of
Bagdad. At length Mohammad ’Alee, in 1809, began to
make preparations against them. To save his army from
marching round by the northern gulfs of the Red Sea, he
ordered timber fora ﬂotilla of twenty-eight vessels to be got
ready at Boolak, the port of Cairo, whence it was carried by
camels to Suez, where the ships were constructed.
