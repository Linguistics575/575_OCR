another master; and grammar, rhetoric, versiﬁcation,
logic, the interpretation of the Eur-an, and the whole
system of religion and law, with all other knowledge
deemed useful, which seldom includes the mere elements
of mathematics, are attained by studying at a collegiate
mosque, and at no expense; for the professors receive
no pay either from the students, who are mostly of the
poorer classes, or from the funds of the mosque.

The wealthy often employ for their sons a private

and then send them to the college. But among this

regarded by the Arabs as essential to a son who is to mix
in genteel company; and to this acquirement is often
added some skill in the art of versiﬁcation, which is ren-

language, and by its system of inﬂexion. These cha-

he often intersperses his prose writings, and not unfro-
