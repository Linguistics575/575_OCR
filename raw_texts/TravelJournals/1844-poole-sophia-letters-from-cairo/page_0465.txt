 

THE

ENGLISHWOMAN IN EGYPT.

 

 

Lanna I.

January, 1845.

' AFTER a residence of nearly three years in an
Eastern country, in the habit of frequent and fami-
liar intercourse with the ladies of the higher and
middle classes of its population, you will probably
think me able to convey some general ideas of their
moral and social state. To do this, I ﬁnd to be a
task of extreme difﬁculty; though my opportuni-
ties of observation have been such as,l believe, few
Englishwomen have enjoyed. In examining the
effects of the peculiar position in which females are
here placed, I have endeavoured to divest myself
of prejudice; but altogether to lose sight of our
English standards of propriety has been impossible;
and as every state of society in the world has its

defects, to avoid comparisons would be unnatural.
