square ; its plan is a square court, surrounded by
portions, and its whole appearance very simple
and plain. The exterior is formed by high bare
walls of brick. The portion at the end of the
court towards Mekkeh has six. rows of columns;
that on the left side, four rows; that on the right,
three; and on the entrance side only one row.
