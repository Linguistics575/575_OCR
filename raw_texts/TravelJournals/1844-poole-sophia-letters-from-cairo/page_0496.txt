The mother, of course, was the chief mourner.
She wore a dark blue head-veil and tdb ;*- a pair
of old trowsers formed part of the rest of her dress,-
aud around her head, over the veil above men-
tioned; was wound a narrow strip of blue muslin,
one of the principal insignia of mourning, as the
crepe hatband is in England. Her hands and feet
were dyed with indigo. The mother-in-law and
her sisters were in like manner disﬁgured. I can
never forget the distracted manner in which the
women of the family and the visitors conducted
themselves, as, time after time, they renewed the
jumping, or rather dancing and screaming, mound
the corpse; how they rent their clothes, and how
they kissed the corpse, and then wept, and fell
down exhausted. There were present the ladies of
all the principal scribes. All of them I' observed
to he in dark clothes; their tdbs, especially, were
of dark and sombre hues. Pink, and every bright
colour, except blue, are considered unbecoming in
the house of mourning.

Until I had been there about an hour, I could
hardly ﬁnd leisure to turn my eyes from the
mourners, to examine the state of the apartment,
which was intentionally put into the utmost dis-
order. All kinds of broken glass, china, and
common earthenware were strewed upon the ﬂoor;

"' The large, loose silk dress worn over the in-door ap-
mrel, and under the habarah in walking or riding.
