Several poor neighbours have lately been stung
by scorpions: we sent them some carbonate of
ammonia to apply to the wounds, and it was the
means of producing the happiest results.

Cairo, with its many ruined houses, affords innu-
merable nests for noxious reptiles; and the progress
of its decay has lately been so rapid, that at last a
proclamation has been issued by the Pasha for
extensive alterations and repairs throughout the
city. The houses are to be whitewashed within
and without; those who inhabit mined houses are
to repair or sell them; and uninhabited dwellings
are to be pulled down for the purpose of forming
squares and gardens; meshrebeeyehs are forbidden,
and mastabahs are to be removed. Cairo, there-
fore, will no longer be an Arab city, and will no
longer possess those peculiarities which render it
so picturesque and attractive. The deep shade in
the narrow streets, increased by the projecting
windows-—the picturesque tradesman, sitting with
one friend or more before his shop, enjoying the
space afforded by his mastabah—these will be no ,
more; and while I cannot but acknowledge the
great necessity for repairing the city, and removing
the ruins which threaten the destruction of pas-
sengers, I should have liked those features retained
which are essentially characteristic—which help,
as it were, to group the people, and form such
admirable accessories to pictures.
