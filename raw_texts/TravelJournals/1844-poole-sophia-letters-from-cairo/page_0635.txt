’Erak], and there joined me a man having a belt round
his waist, and I said, ‘ Who art thou ? ’-——He answered,
‘ A Christian; and I desire thy company.’ We walked
together for seven days, eating nothing; after which he
said to me, ‘ O monk of the Muslims, produce what thou
hast in the way of refreshment; for we are hungry: ’ so
I said, ‘ O my God,.disgrace me not before this inﬁdel :’
and lo, a tray, upon which were bread and broiled meat

him, ‘ O monk of the Christians, produce what thou hast
in the way of refreshment; for the turn is come to thee :’
whereupon he leaned upon his staff, and prayed; and 10,
two trays, containing double that which was on my tray.
I was confounded, and refused to eat: he urged me,
saying, ‘ Eat; ’ but I did it not. Then said he, ‘ Be
glad; for I give thee two pieces of good news : one of
them is. that I testify that there is no deity but God,
and that Mohammad is God’s apostle: the other, that I
said, O God, if there be worth in this servant, supply me
