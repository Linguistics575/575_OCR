the rock in its neighbourhood. The nicety with
which the stones are united in the sides of the ﬁrst
passage is very remarkable. In some parts the
joint cannot be discerned without a close and mi-
nute examination. In the ﬂooring of this- pm,
and of all the sloping passages in this pyramid,
notches have been roughly cut, like steps, to pre-
vent the feet from slipping; but. I found them
very far from producing the desired effect, being
now polished by the naked feet of the guides.
These notches have been the work of modern
eXplorers. At the distance of nearly seventy feet
(measuring from the outer surface 'of the huge
block above the entrance) we ﬁnd that one of the
stones which form the rooﬁng of the passage has
been hewn away precisely at the point where the
second passage branches off in an ascending direc-
tion (see the letter 0 in the section). Here we
discover the square end of a granite block, which
closes the entrance of the second passage, being
exactly ﬁtted to ﬁll up the aperture. The persons
who opened the pyramid, being unable to remove
this obstacle, have made a forced communication
with the ascending passage. At the distance of
eighty feet (from the entrance of the pyramid) is
the forced aperture, on the right side of the passage
(see d in the section). It has been made by hol-
lowing out the rooﬁng, and cutting away the upper
~rt of the side of the lower passage.
