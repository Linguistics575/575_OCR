on each side. Here are extensive quarries, from
which were; taken the materials for the construction
of many of the temples in the Thebais. This part
is called “Gebel es-Silsileh," or “the Mountain
of the Clmi‘n.” Where- the calcareous district be-
gins, are two inmlated hills (El-Gcbeleyn) on the
west of the Nile; one of them close to the river,
and the other at a- littl'e distance behind theformer.
The valley then becomes wider, and, more irregular
in its direction; 'and the Nile winds through the
middle of the cultivable land, or nearly so. After-
wards the valley assumes a less serpentine form,
and the river ﬂows along the. eastern side ;: in many
places washing the. sides, of the precipitous moun-
tains. The calcarems district continues to the
end of the valley, where the mountains on; both
sides diverge; the Arabian. chain running due wt
to Suez, andthewestern hills extending in. a
north-west. direction, towards the Mediterranean.
Near the termination of the valley is am opening in
the low western mountains, through which a. canal
conveys the waters of the Nile into the fertile
province of El-Feiyoomt On the north-west of
this province is a great. lake, which receives the
superﬂuous waters during the inundation. The
length of the valley of Egypt, from the cataracts to
the metropolis, is about 450 geographical miles.
The distance by the river is above 500 miles from
the cataracts to the metropolis, and about 400 miles
