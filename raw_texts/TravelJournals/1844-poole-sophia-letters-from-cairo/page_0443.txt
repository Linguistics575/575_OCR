then only sixteen years of age, to whom, on the 1 6th of
July, Mohammad ’Alee signiﬁed his determination to assert
by force his right to the hereditary government of all the pro-
vinces then under his command, instead of that of Egypt only,
which was offered to him by the new Sultan. The ﬁve allied
powers, England, France, Austria, Prussia, and Russia, now
interfered in a more peremptory manner, and negotiations
ensued, which terminated in the withdrawal of France and
the conclusion of a treaty between the remaining four powers
and Turkey, to compel the submission of Mohammad ’Alee.
The treaty was signed in London, July 15, 1840.

A ﬂeet consisting of English, Austrian, and Turkish ves-

of the treaty. Beyrout, Acre, and Sidon were successively
stormed and taken, and after much negotiation Mohammad
’Alee consented to relinquish Syria altogether, and the here-
ditary government of Egypt was bestowed upon him by the
Sultan, January 11, 1841. The important political events of
the life of Mohammad ’Alee here terminate.

He has three sons now living. Ibrahim Pasha was born
at Kavalla in 1789. He is middle-sized, and very stout.
His features are large, heavy, and marked by the small pox.
Toosoon Pasha, the second son, died of the plague in 1813.
Ishmail Pasha, the third son, was murdered by the blacks at
Sennaar. Said Bey, the fourth son, was born in 1822. The
ﬁfth son is called Mohammad ’Alee.

Mohammad ’Alee is now 75 years of age. His bodily
vigour is said to be breaking down, as might be expected,
but his mental energy remains unimpaired. He is of the
middle stature, stout, and robust; his features somewhat
coarse, but very expressive, with dark grey eyes. Mr. St.
John, who visited Egypt in 1832, has very minutely de-
scribed his habitS, both private and public, as they were at
