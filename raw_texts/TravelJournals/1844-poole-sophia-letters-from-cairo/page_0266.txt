only be, from our description, a harmless house-
snake.

You have doubtless read many accounts of the
feats of Eastern snake-charmers, and wondered at
their skill. Very lately, a friend of ours witnessed
an instance of the fascination, or rather attraction,
possessed by one of these peeple. He was in
the house of an acquaintance when the charmer
arrived, who, after a little whistling, and other
absurd preliminaries, invoked the snake thus: “ I
conjure thee, by our Lord Suleyman” (that is,’
Solomon, the son of David), “ who ruled over
mankind and the Jan” (or Genii); “if thou be
obedient, come to me; and if thou be disobedient,
do not hurt me 1” After a short pause, a. snake
descended from a crevice in the wall of the room,
and approached the man, who secured it. No
other snake appearing, it was decided that the
house was cleared, and our friend requested the
snake-charmer to accompany him to his own house.
He did so, and invoked the snakes in the same
words. The invocation was attended by the same
result: a snake descended, and in the same manner
resigned itself to the serpent-charmer.

- With regard to the serpent still in our house,
let us_ say, with the Muslims, we are thankful it
is not a scorpion. Their philosophy is a lesson
to us.
