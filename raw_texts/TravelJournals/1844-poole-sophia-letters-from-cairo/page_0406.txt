or 50th chapter of the Kat-an) was to cpen the boy’s eyes
‘in a supernatural manner; to make his sight pierce into
what is to us the invisible world.

I had prepared, by the magician’s direction, some frank-
incense and coriander-seed,* and a chaﬁng-dish with some
live charcoal in it. These were now brought into the room,
together with the boy who was to be employed: he had been
called in, by my desire, from among some boys in the street,
returning from a manufactory; and was about eight or nine
years of age. In reply to my inquiry respecting the descrip-
tion of persons who could see in the magic mirror of ink, the
magician said that they were a boy not arrived at puberty, a
virgin, a black female slave, and a pregnant woman. The
chaﬁng-dish was placed before him and the boy; and the
latter was placed on a seat. The magician now desired my
servant to put some fra'nkincense and coriander—seed into the
chaﬁng-dish; then, taking hold of the boy’s right hand, he
drew, in the palm of it, a magic square, of which a copy is
here given. The ﬁgures which it contains are Arabic nume-
rals.1- In the centre, he poured a little ink, and desired the
boy to look into it, and tell him if he could see his face
reﬂected in it; the boy replied that he saw his face clearly.

*' He generally requires some benzoin to be added to these.

i The numbers in this magic square, in our own ordinary characters,
are as follows :—

It will seen that the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal rows give each ,
the same sum, namely, 15.
