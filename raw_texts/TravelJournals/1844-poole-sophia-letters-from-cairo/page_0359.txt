steps, which has never been explored to its termi-
nation : the soft and crumbling nature of the rock
through which it is cut rendering any attempt to
clear it out extremely dangerous. The enormous
mass of granite under the sarcophagus in the Great
Pyramid may have been placed there for a similar
purpose, or to cover the mouth of a vault or pit ;
so that, in case any violater of the sacred ediﬁce
should succeed (notwithstanding the portcullises of
granite), in effecting an entrance into the Great
Chamber, he might, on discovering the sarcophagus,
believe the object of his search to be accomplished.
An excavation has been made (I believe by Col.
Howard Vyse), beneath this huge stone, but it
seems hardly to have been carried sufﬁciently far.
The sides of the chamber are formed of six regular
courses of granite blocks, which are united with
the greatest exactness, and their surfaces are per-
fectly even and polished, without hieroglyphics or
any other inscriptions or ornaments. In the north-
ern side near the corner of the entrance is a small
aperture, and Opposite to it in the southern side is
another. 001. Vyse discovered the termination of
each of these, in the exterior of the pyramid: they
seem to have been designed for the purpose of yen-
‘tilation. The roof of the chamber consists of nine
long granite blocks which extend from side to side.
The half only of the stone at each end is seen, the
other half resting on the wall.
