walk more meekly after her husband than I fol-

the authoritative air he assumed as soon as he had
passed the threshold of the mosque; indeed he
played his part admirably.

At the threshold all persons remove their shock,

or slippers, the ladies walking, in the mosque, in-

before described to you ; and here I must remark
on the scrupulous attention which is paid to clean-
liness; for the pale yellow morocco is scarcely in-

jured by a whole day spent in perambulating these‘

Muslim sanctuaries. The men generally carry the
shoes in the left hand through the mosque, placed
sole to sole, and some ladies carry theirs, but we,
like many others, preferred leaving them with our
servants, for the walking-dress in itself is so ex-
ceedingly cumbrous, and requires so much manage-
ment, that two hands are scarcely sufﬁcient to pre-
serve its proper arrangement.

The mosque of the Hasaneyn,* which is situated
to the north of the Azhar, and not far distant, was
founded in the year of the Flight 549 (A.D.
1154-5) ; but has been more than once rebuilt.

"‘ By the Hasaneyn are meant Basin and Hoseyn, the
grandsons of the Prophet.
