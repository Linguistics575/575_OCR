This description of dress leads me back to the
lady whose appearance so especially attracted my
admiration. After I requested that my riding-
dress might be brought, I observed several ladies
crossing the saloon, among whom she' walked,
baring it towards me, and looking like a queen in
person and in dress. She dressed me with much
grace, and then with her companions stepped back-
into the doorway to receive and give the parting
salutation. One circumstance I have omitted,
namely, the crimson embroidered curtains, which
hang before all the doorways in the palace; for the
doors stand open, a closed door being never permitted
in the hareems. Much taste is displayed in the em -
broidery of these curtains; indeed, the perfection
of taste is to be found in the decorations of the
Kasr ed-Dubarah.
