LETTER VIII.

November 26th.
MY DEAR FRIEND,

I HAVE just returned from witnessing the
curious procession of the Mahmal, preparatory to
the departure of the great caravan of pilgrims to
Mekkah. We were early on the way, and after
riding for nearly an hour we found ourselves in the
main street of the city, opposite to the Khan el-

many cases, this morning, our donkeys threaded
their way among loaded camels, where horses were
turned back; and my apprehensions lest the large
bales of goods should really sweep my boys from
their saddles, were scarcely removed by the ex-

one arm round each of my children, in passing
through the dangerous thoroughfares. I assure
