THE ENGLISHWOMAN IN EGYPT. 89

ﬂowing of the Nile are irrigated artiﬁcially, if
sufﬁciently near to the river, or to a canal.

As all the cultivable soil of Egypt has been de-
posited by the river, it might be expected that the
land would at length rise so high as to be above
the reach of the inundation; but the bed of the
river rises at the same time, and in the same
degree.

At Thebes, the Nile rises about thirty-six feet;
at the cataracts about forty; at Rosetta, owing to
the proximity of the mouth, it only rises to the
height of about three feet and a half. The Nile
begins to rise in the end of June, or the beginning
of July; that is to say, about, or soon' after, the
summer solstice, and attains its greatest height in
the end of September, or sometimes (but rarely)
in the beginning of October; that is, in other
words, about or soon after the autumnal equinox.
During the ﬁrst three months of its decrease, it
loses about half the height it had attained; and
during the remaining six months, it falls more
and more slowly. It generally remains not longer
than three or four days at its maximum, and the
same length of time at its minimum: it may there-
fore be said to' be three months on the increase, and
nine months gradually falling. It often remains
without any apparent increase or diminution, at
other times than those of its greatest or least ele-
vation, and is subject to other slight irregularities.
