they want a few roses, they take out some of these buds,
which they ﬁnd unaltered, sprinkle a little water upon

it, said, “ I went into India, and I saw, at one of its
towns, a large rose, sweet-scented, upon which was
described, in white characters, ‘ There is no deity but
God; Mohammad is God‘s apostle: Aboo Bekr is the
very veracious: ’Omar is the discriminator;’ and I

Cairo by the cry of “ The rose was a thorn: from the
sweat of the Prophet it blossomed l” in allusion to a
miracle recorded of Mohammad. “ When I was taken
up into heaven,” said the Prophet, “ some of my sweat
fell upon the earth, and from it sprang the rose; and
whoever would smell my scent let him smell the rose.”
