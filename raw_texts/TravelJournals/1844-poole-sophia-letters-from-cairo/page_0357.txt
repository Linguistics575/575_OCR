section). From this commences a horizontal M
age: three feet seven inches and a half in height,
and three feet 'ﬁve inches and a half in width (see
7):). Within it, on the right, is the entrance of a
forced pasmge, made'in search for other chambers
“than those already known. At the distance of hut
feet ﬁve inches (from the entrance of the w
passage), commences an Open space above (see a),
the upper part of which is nearly twice as wide w
the passage, and nine feet eight inches *in length :
but the passage below is contracted again to in
former height by a kind of portcullns, formed of
two blocks of granite one above another, each one
“foot three inches thick ; these have been let down
éfrom the space above between two small projections
«‘on each side which form a pair of grooves. Be-
yond this, the passage (which is here of granite),
is open as before, to the space above, and there are
grooves for the reception of three other portcullisw
of granite, by which the architect thought that he
should for ever prevent access to the mysteriem
chamberdwhich contains the ear-cephagns; but these
have been broken and their fragments carried away.
The passage beyond (see 0), is of its fermer di-
mensions, and continues so to the distance of eight
feet ﬁve inches, its whole length, from the top of
the Grand Passage, being twenty-two 'feet and a
' ' half. It terminates at the eastern extremity ”of the
