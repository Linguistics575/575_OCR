grotto (s) between ﬁve and six feet high, and about
three times as long, turning to the right. It is
hollowed out in a vein of coarse but compact
gravel, and the well, in consequence of this vein,
is lined with masonry for the space of a few feet
above and below the grotto. Where the masonry
ceases (t) the well takes a s10ping direction and
continues so to the bottom; but towards the bottom
(see u in the section) the slope becomes more steep.
All the sloping part is cut through the solid rock
below the foundation of the pyramid, and is of a
square form. At the bottom of the well (0) is a
horizontal passage six feet long, communicating
with the ﬁrst passage, two hundred and twelve feet
below the aperture by which one ascends to the
second passage.

The ﬁrst passage of the pyramid from the aper-
ture last mentioned, continues in the same direc-
tion, and is of the same dimensions, but is cut
'through the solid rock, and is not lined with ma-
sonry. The aperture which communicates with the
bottom of the well is two feet ten inchesbroad. It is
on the right of a persOn descending the ﬁrst passage.
This passage continues in the same direction to the
distance of twenty-three feet further (see w in the
section), beyond which it is horizontal, and so low
and incumbered with rubbish, that the explorer is
obliged to drag himself along in a prostrate po-
sition. At the'distance of sixteen feet nine inches
