20 THE ENGLISHWOMAN IN EGYPT.

In the open space before the hotel there are
long trains of camels laden with water-skins, or
with bales of merchandise, winding slowly and
cautiously along even in this wide place, while
their noiseless tread, and their digniﬁed (I might
almost say affected) walk, at once distinguishes
them from all other beasts of burden.

I must not omit mentioning the shops of Alex-
andria, for they resemble cupboards rather _ than
rooms; and this I understand to be the case in
most Turkish and Arabic cities. A raised seat of
brick or stone about three feet high, and the same
or more in width, extends along each side of the
street, and upon this the tradesman sits before his
shop, either smoking or at work. It is really
amusing to see how easily they appear to gain
their livelihood: the fact is, that they are an ex-
ceedingly contented people, and there is much of
real philosophy in their conclusions. They are
seldom disposed, when working on their own ac-
count, to labour for more than enough, and have
the quality, so rarely fOund in Europe, of consider-
ing that enough is as desirable as abundance:
therefore they are happy, and “ their best riches,
ignorance of wealth.” I have observed, at corners
of the streets, or wherever else there was sufﬁcient
space, groups of men and women seated on the
ground, with baskets before them containing bread
and vegetables for sale.
