This conquest was mainly due to the impetucns courage of

Mecea was taken in 1813. In 1814 Sa’ud, the chief of the
Wehabees, died, and was succeeded bykis eldest son Abdul-
lah. The death of Sa’udwasthe forerunnerof the minof

conquests till 1815, when peace was concluded on terms

unfavourable to Ahdnllah. Hostilities however suddenly
broke out again, and another expedidon was ﬁttedoat, under
the command of Ibrahim Pasha, the eldest son of Moham~
mad 'Alee, who entered Arabia with his army in 1816.
The Wahabees made an obstinate resistance, but in 1818
they were compelled to retreat to Der'aiyeh, where Abdul-
lah was besieged by Ibrahim. The siege was long, but was
carried on by Ibrahim with admirable skill and perse-
verance till December, 1818, when Abdullah surrendered.
He and several of his family were sent to Constantinople,
when after having been paraded through the streets for
three days, they were beheaded. The greater partof the
tern-ironies conquered from ﬁle Wahabees fell under the
unﬂiority of Mohammad ’Alee. The power of the Wuha-
‘bcs, though broken, was not exterminated, and they gave
him considerable trouble aﬁerwards.
