attended with little success; and the wisdom of his policy in
this matter may well be doubted. Every hand in Egypt
which is transferred from agricultural labour to the manu-
factures which have been artiﬁcially introduced into the
country, is removed from a productive and proﬁtable em-
ployment to one which has been exceedingly expensive, and,

I have been most anxious to become well acquainted (before

people. The will of the Pasha is almost absolute; but he has
certainly effected a great reform, by the introduction of Euro-
pean military and naval tactics, the results of which have al-
ready been considerable, and will be yet more extensive, and,
