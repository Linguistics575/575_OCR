tomb. This is a hollow, oblong vault, one side of which
faces the direction of Mekkeh, generally large enough
to contain four or more bodies, and having an oblong
monument of stone or brick constructed over it, with a
stela at the head and foot. Upon the former of these
two stelae (which is often inscribed with a text from the

[Cur-an, and the name of the deceased, with the date' of i .

his death), a turban, cap, or other head-dress, is some-
times carred, showing the rank or class of the person or
persons buried beneath ; and in many cases a cupola sup-
ported by four walls, or by columns, &c., is constructed
over the smaller monument. The body is laid on its
right side, or inclined by means of a few crude bricks, so a
that the face is turned towards Mekkeh; and a person
is generally employed to dictate to the deceased the
answers which he should give when he is examined by
the two angels Munkar and Nekeer. If the funeral be
that of a person of rank or wealth, the bread and water,
8w. before mentioned are then distributed to the poor.‘
