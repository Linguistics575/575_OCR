The Nile becomes turbid a little before its rise is
apparent, and soon after it assumes a green hue,
which it retains more than a fortnight. Its water is

bottles, which cool it by evaporation. While the
Nile is green, the people generally abstain from
drinking the water fresh from the river, having;
recourse to a supply previously drawn, and kept 1n
cisterns.

The width of the Nile where there are no
islands is in few parts more than half a mile.
The branches which enclose the Delta. are not
so wide, generally speaking, as the undivided
stream above , and the river is as wide in most
parts of Upper Egypt as in the lower extremity of
the valley.

The rapidity of the current when the waters are-
low is not greater than the rate of a mile and a
quarter in an hour; but during the higher state of
the river, the current is very rap-id, and while
vessels with fin-led sails are carried down by the
stream with great speed, others ascend the river at
an almost equal rate, favoured by the strong
