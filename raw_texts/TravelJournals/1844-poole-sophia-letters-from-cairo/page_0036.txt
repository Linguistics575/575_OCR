strongly recommend any person travelling in
Egypt to sleep under musquito curtains winter and
summer. There is certainly a consciousness of
heat and want of air, for perhaps a quarter of an
hour after the curtain is closely tucked in, but
what is that compared to the constant attacks of
vermin of an extraordinary variety, to which the
traveller in the East is subject? Our ﬁrst night
in the track-boat, without musquito-curtains, will
not be easily forgotten.‘

On the following morning we arrived at the
point where the canal enters the Nile, and found
that the boat which we expected would be ready
for our voyage to Cairo, had conveyed a party
towards the scene of a festival, and might not re-
turn for some days. Here our situation was one
of severe suffering. We were stationed between
two high ridges, composed of mud thrown up in
forming the bed of the canal, very dry of course,
and exceedingly dusty, and covered with mud huts.

" Since I wrote the above, the Peninsular and Oriental
Steam Navigation Company have, I believe, undertaken the
conveyance of travellers from Alexandria to Suez. Be this
as it may, it is due to the Company to say, that our voyage
from England to Egypt was rendered as pleasant as a splen-
did vessel, excellent attendance, and every desirable accom-
modation could make it; and the manner in which travellers
are brought through Egypt, on their way to India, is now, I
am told, as comfortable as any reasonable person could

come.
