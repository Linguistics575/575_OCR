cient writers have extolled the salubrity of the air
of Alexandria. This quality of the air was attri-

situation of the city, the sea being on one side, and
the lake Mareotis on the other. The imalubrity
of the climate, of later years, has been regarded as

marsh. The English army, in 1801, made a cut
by which the water of the sea was admitted from
the lake of Aboo-Keer into the bed of the lake
Mareotis; and the operation was repeated by Mo-

1807: on each occasion, as you will have supposed,
military policy dictated the measure; and as soon
as the object in view had been attained, the gap
was speedily closed, as it cut off the supply of fresh
water from Alexandria by interrupting the course
of the canal. While the communication between
the two lakes remained open, it was not found
that the climate of Alexandria was at all improved;
and the evaporation of the waters of the lake Ma-

The damp and rain during the winter here, and the
heavy dew at night throughout the year, have a
particularly baneful inﬂuence. Cases of fever are
very general; and it is always observed that this
