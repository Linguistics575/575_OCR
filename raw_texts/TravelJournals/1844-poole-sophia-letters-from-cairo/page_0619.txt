about to mention are prescribed to be ‘observed ; though,
as far as my observations and inquiries allow me to judge,
they are generally neglected by the modern Muslims.
The ﬁrst of these is a sacriﬁce. The victim is called
’algeekah. It should be a ram or 'goat; or two such
animals should be meriﬁced for a son, and one for a
daughter. This rite is regarded by lbn Hambal as
absolutely obligatory: he said, “ If a father sacriﬁce not
for his son, and he [the son] die, that son will not inter-
cede for him on the day of judgment.” The founders
of the three other principal sects regard it in different
and less important lights, though Mohammad slew an
’akeehah for himself after his prophetic mission. The
person should say, on slaying; the victim, “ O God,
verily this ’akeekah is a ransom for my son such a onej
its blood for his blood, and its ﬂesh for his ﬂesh, and its
bone for his bone, and its skin for his skin, and its hair
for his hair. 0 God, make it a ransom for my son from
Hell ﬁre.” A bone of the victim should not be broken.1"

be performed the other ceremony above alluded to,
