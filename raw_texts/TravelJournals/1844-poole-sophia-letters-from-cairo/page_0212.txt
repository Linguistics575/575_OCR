purchased by El-Melik Es-Sdleh N egm-ed-Deen,

the last but one of the sultans of the race of '

Eiyoob: they resided in his palace on the island
of Er-Rodah; and hence they received the appella-
tion of “ the Bahree Memlooks ;”"' the word Bahree,
in this case, signifying “ of the river.” Aikr
having been instructed in military exercises, these
slaves constituted a formidable body, whose power
soon became uncontrollable. A very beautiful
female slave, called Sheger-ed-Durr (or the tree
of pearls), of the same race as these Memlooks,
was the favourite wife of N egm-ed-Deen. This
prince died at El-Mansoorah, whither he had
gone to protect his kingdom from the crusaders,
who, under Louis IX., had taken Damietta. Too-
ran Shah succeeded his father N egm-ed-Deen on
the throne of Egyptﬁ but reigned only seventy
days: he was put to death by the Memlooks, to
whom he had rendered himself obnoxious; as he
had also to Sheger-ed-Durr, who was an instigator
of his death. Under this sultan, the French in-
vaders of Egypt suffered a signal defeat, and Louis
himself was taken prisoner. Sheger-ed-Durr caused
herself to be proclaimed queen of Egypt, with the

* El-Makreezee.

1- D’Herbelot and some other European writers have
ﬁllen into an error in saying that Sheger—ed-Durr was the
mother of Tooran Shah. She bore to N egm-ed-Deen one
son, who died in infancy.
