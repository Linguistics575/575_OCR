Egypt principally owes its Milky. Its chief
characteristics (its colour, the banks between which
it ﬂows, etc.) are similar to those of the Nile of
Egypt. Its dark. calour, arising: from its being
impregnated with soil during the greater part of
the year, has caused it to receive the name of “ the
blue river,” while the other branch, from theoppo-
site colour of its waters, is called “ the white
river.” The latte- is considerably wider than the
former; its banks are. sloping lawns, richly wooded,
and very unlike the steep and bmken banks of the
Nile of' Egypt.

At its entrance into: the. valley of Egypt, the
Nile is obstructed. by inmnnerahle rocks of granite,
which muse a succession of cataracts, or rather
rapids. Themountains en the cm of the river, as
well as the islands in it, are hereof granite: those
on the western side are of sandstone. From this
point, to the distance: oi thirty leagues southward,
sandstone mountains of small altitude extend on
each side of the river. The: valley, so far, is very
narrow, particularly throughout the upper half of
the sandstune district; and there; is but. very little
cultivable: land; on the. banks: of the river in that
part; in some places the mountains are close to
the stream; and in others, enly a narrow sandy
strip intervena. At the-distance. of twelve leagues
below the cataracts, the river is contracted to little
more than. half its. usual width, by the mountains
