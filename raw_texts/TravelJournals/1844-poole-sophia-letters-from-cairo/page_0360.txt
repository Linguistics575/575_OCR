Returning from this chamber we stop at the
platform at the upper end of the Grand Passage
(see I in in the mtion).* Here we ohserveat the
top of the eastern *wall (that is on the left of a
person facing the end of the mssage),.at the height
of twenty-four feet, a square aperture which is the
entrance of another passage (9). Small notches
have been cut at ‘the corner all the wuy'up, for
the reception of the ends of short pieces of wood,
which were thus placed :one above another so as to
form a kind of ladder. These have been taken
away, and the ascent without them is diﬁcult and
dangerous. When my brother was here 31an
some years ago, two Arabs contrived to climb up
by means of the little notches, and took with then
a strong rope, the end of which he tied round him,
and so they drew him up to the‘top. As soon as
he was freed from the rape they demanded of him
a present, threatening that if he refused they would
descend and leave him there. Though my brother
laughed at their threats, they would not for some
minutes con-fess that they were joking. The
passage in which he found himself is only .two feet
four inches square. It turns immediately to the
right, and to the distance of a few feet it continues
square and of the same dimensions as before, but
‘ * There' is a remarkable echo no this passage, on account

of which it is a custom of travellers to ﬁre a pistol or gun
here.
