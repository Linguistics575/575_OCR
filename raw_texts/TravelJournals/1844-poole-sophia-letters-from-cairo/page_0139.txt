arrangement is displayed in them. They have ge-
nerally one or more sikiyehs, which raise the water
for their irrigation from wells.

- The canal" (ElsKhaleeg) which traverses the
metropolis is no ornament to it. In most parts of
its course through the town, it is closely hemmed
in on each side by the backs of houses ; therefore
it cannot be seen, excepting in a few places, by the
passengers in the streets. Most of the bridges
over it are moreover lined with shop on both
sides, so that a person passing over eannot see that
he is crossing the canal. The water of the Nile
is admitted into the canal in August, and the en-
tmnee is closed by a dam of earth not long after
the river has begun to subside; consequently, after
three or four months, only stagnant puddles re-
main in it. While it continues open, boats enter
it from the Nile, and pass through the whole
length of the metropolis.

Of the public buildings of Cairo, the most inte-
resting certainly are the mosques, the more re-
markable of which I have described to you. They
are extremely picturesque, and exquisite taste is
displayed in the variety and elegance of their
m'éd’nehs or menarets: but the beauty of these and
other parts is, in my opinion, much injured by the
prevalent fashion of daubing the alternate courses

"' This canal is the ancient Ammis Trajanus.
