magniﬁcent monument. The shaft of the column is
a. single block of red granite, sixty-eight feet in
height, and nine feet in diameter at the bottom, ac-

high. The base, plinth, and pedestal are likewise
of red granite, and each is a. single block. The

scription on the pedestal, but it can only be faintly

seen when the rays of the sun fall obliquely upon
