Kudee are Arabs, the judge must place the utmost conﬁ-
dence in the Chief Interpreter, whose place is permanent, and
who is consequently well acquainted with all the customs
of the court, particularly with the system of bribery; and
this knowledge he is generally very ready to communicate
to every new Kadee and Naib. A man may be grossly
ignorant of the law, and yet hold the oﬁice of Kadee of
Cairo: several instances of this kind have occurred; but the
Nai'b must be a lawyer of learning and experience.

There are ﬁre minor courtsof justice in Cairo; and like-
wise one at is principal port, Boolék ; and one at its south-
ern port, Masr El-’Ateekah. A deputy of the chief Kadee
presides at each of' them, and. conﬁrms their acts. The
matters submitted to these minor tribunals are chieﬂy re-
specting the sales of property, and legacies, marriages, and
divorces; for the Kadee marries female orphans under age
who have no relations of age to act as their guardians; and
wives often have recourse to law to compel their husbands
to divorce them. In every country town there is also a K13-
dee, generally a native of the place, but never a Turk, who
decides all cases, sometimes from his own knowledge of
the law, but commonly on the authority of a Matteo.
One We generally serves for two or three or more
villages.

Each of the four orthodox sects of the; Muslims has its
‘ Sheykh,’ or religious chief, who is chosen from among the
most learned of the body, and resides in the metroPolis; and
these sheykhs, together with the Kadee, the Nakeeb el—Ash-
raf (the chief of the Shereefs, or descendants of the Prophet),
and several other persons, constitute the ’Ulama (or learned
men), by whom the Turkish Pushes and Memlook chieﬁ
have often been kept in: awe, and by whom their tyranny
has freqmntly been- restricted :' but new this learned body
