companions asked for some bread, and .two ﬂat
cakes were brought, and divided amongst us. . Find-
ing that the English really liked an early breakfast,
our attendants most good-naturedly promised that
everything “ should be very nice for us, and plen-
tiful, on the following day; but they had not been
_ aware that any one ate in the morning.” We went
to an adjoining room, which was set apart as a pri-
vate room for us, a thoroughfare, as is generally
the case, most exquisitely ﬁtted up. It is the
Pasha’s favourite resort in the Hareem. The
divans extend nearly round the three sides of the
room, leaving only the spaces for the doors opposite
to each other; they are of stone-coloured satin,
embroidered with gold in raised work of fruit and
ﬂowers. The divans along the end of each division
of the great saloon, which adjoins this room, are of
the same description.

Our now little party were scarcely seated in this
beautiful room, when the eldest wife of the Pasha,
a very charming and aﬁ'able old lady, entered, and,
seeing us naturally rise to her, requested .us imme-
diately to resume our seats. When we had done
so, she again most politely addressed us, assuring
us of a hearty welcome, and adding that the palace
was hers, and that she hoped we should remain.
We had just acknowledged her kindness, when the
favourite wife of Ibraheem Pasha joined our .party,
and conversed with ,us in a most amiable manner.
