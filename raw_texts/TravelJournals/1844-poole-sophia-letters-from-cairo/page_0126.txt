MY DEAR FRIEND,

I HAVE already attempted to describe to
you my impressions on my ﬁrst entry into Cairo.
My ideas of it, for a considerable time, were very
confused; it seemed to me, for the most part, a
labyrinth of ruined and half-ruined houses, of the
most singular construction ; and in appearance so
old, that I was surprised at being informed that,
only a few years ago, it presented a far less
unhappy aspect.

Cairo is digniﬁed with the name of Umm-ed-
Dunya- (the Mother of the World) and other
sounding appellations. Though it has much de-
clined since the discovery of the passage to India
by the Cape of Good Hope, and more especially of
late years, it is still one of the most considerable
cities in the East. It is altogether an Arabian
city; and the very ﬁnest specimens of Arabian
architecture are found within its walls. The pri-
vate houses are in general moderately large; the
lower part of stone, and the superstructure of
brick; but some are little better than huts.
