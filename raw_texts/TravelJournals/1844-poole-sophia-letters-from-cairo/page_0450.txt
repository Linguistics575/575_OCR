232 APPENDIX.

The following account of the government of Egypt is
abridged from Mr. Lane’s ‘ Manners and Customs of the
Modern Egyptians,’ Lond. 1842.

Egypt has, of late years, experienced great political
changes, and nearly ceased to be a province of the Turkish
Empire. Its present Pasha (Mohammad ’Alee), having ex-
terminated the Ghuzz, or Memlooks, who shared the govern-
ment with his predecessors, has rendered himself almost an
independent prince. He, however, professes allegiance to
the Sultan, and remits the tribute, according to the former
custom, to Constantinople: he is, moreover, under an obliga-
tion to respect the fundamental laws of the Kur-an and the
Traditions; but he exercises a dominion otherwise unlimited.
He may cause any one of his subjects to be put to death
without the formality of a trial, or without assigning any
cause: a simple horizontal motion of his hand is suﬁcient to
imply the sentence of decapitation. But he is not prone to
shed blood without any reason: severity is a characteristic
of this prince, rather than wanton cruelty; and boundless
ambition has prompted him to almost every action by which
he has attracted either praise or censure.

In the Citadel of Cairo is a court of judicature, called
‘ ed-Deewan el-Khideewee,’ where in the Pasha’s absence
presides his ‘ Kikhya,’ or deputy. In cases which do not fall
within the province of the Kadee, or which are suﬂiciently
clear to be decided without referring them to the court of
that oﬂicer, or to another council, the president of the Dec--
wan el-Khideewee passes judgment. N umerons guard-
houses have been established throughout the metropolis, at
each of which is stationed a body of Nizam, or regular
troops. Persons accused of thefts, assaults, &c., in Cairo,
are given in charge to a soldier of the guard, who takes
them to the chief guard-house, in the Mooskee, a street in “4“
