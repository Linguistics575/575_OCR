when directed with regard to their work, will
answer with the most abject submission, although
really disheartened by the most ordinary occupa-
tion. They sleep in their clothes, after the manner
of the country, and the habit of doing so, coupled
with the .neglect of proper washing, involving a
want of that freshness produced by a complete
change of clothes, is especially objectionable.

their cleanliness would be secured, as frequent ab-
lutions are ordered in their code of law; but the
lower orders of the women have seldom any reli-
gion at all.

Believe me, you are fortunate in England, in
this respect, as well as many others, and I hope
you will prize our English maids, if you have not
done so already.
