destination, the less grand and imposing did they
appear. From their aspect, as I ﬁrst drew near
to them, I should have formed a very inadequate
idea of their dimensions. As soon as we had
crossed the river they appeared within a mile of
us; and after we had proceeded more than a league
from El-Geezeh, I could scarcely believe that we
were still a full league from the pyramids; for the
distance to them from El-Geezeh, by the route
which we took, is more than six miles, though it is
just ﬁve miles in a direct line. When we arrived
within a mile of the pyramids, the illusion became
greater: the courses of stone were then plainly
discernible, and it was easy to calculate that they
were not more in number than the courses of brick
in a house about ﬁfty or sixty feet high. These
presented a scale by which the eye was much de-
ceived in estimating the altitude of the structure ;
being unaccustomed to the sight of stones of such
enormous magnitude employed in building. But
neither of these causes would be sufﬁcient to pro-
