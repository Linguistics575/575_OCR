Barkook, was regent. In the year of the Flight
784 (A.D. 1382) the latter usurped the throne, and
with him commenced the dynasty of Circassian
Memlooks, also called the Burjee Memlooks, which

citadel :* the word burg signiﬁes a tower. Syria
continued subject to the Burjee sultans. This
dynasty consisted of twenty-three sultans, and con-
tinued one hundred and thirty-eight years and a
half. Ez-Yahir-Barkook, El-Mu-eiyad, Kzﬁd Bey,
and El-Ghdrre may be mentioned as the most
