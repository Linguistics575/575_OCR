APPENDIX. 221

asserting that the practice of drinking wine in private,
and by select parties, is far from being uncommon among

.modern Muslims, though certainly more so than it was

before the introduction of tobacco into the East, in the
beginning of the seventeenth century of our era; for this
herb, being in a slight degree exhilarating, and at the
same time soothing, and unattended by the injurious
eﬁ'ects that result from wine, is a suﬁcient luxury to many
who, without it, would have recourse to intoxicating be-
verages merely to pass away hours of idleness. The use
of coffee, too, which became common in Egypt, Syria,
and other countries besides Arabia, a century earlier than
tobacco, doubtless mnded to render the habit of drinking
wine less general. That it was adopted as a substitute
for wine appears even from its name, “ kahweh,” an old
Arabic term for wine; whence the Turkish “ kahveh,"
the Italian “ caﬂ'e,” and our “ coffee.”

There is an Arabic work of some celebrity, and not of
small extent, entitled “ Halbet el-Kumeyt,”* apparently
written shortly before the Arabs were in possession of
the ﬁrst of the above-mentioned substitutes for wine,
nearly the whole of which consists of anecdotes and verses
relating to the pleasures resulting from, or attendant
upon, the use of wine; a few pages at the end being de-
voted to the condemnation of this practice, or, in other
words, to prove the worthlessness of all that precedes.
Of this work I possess a cepy, a quarto volume of 464
pages. I have endeavoured to skim its cream; but
found it impossible to do so without collecting, at the

* That is, a race-course for allies of wit and eloquence on the subject
of wine: the word “ kumeyt ” being used, in preference to more than a
hundred others that might have been emploved, as signifying “ wine,"
because it bears also the meaning of “ a deep bay horse."
