wood. Over this pm of the building is a public
schoolroom, with an open front, formed of pillars
and arches; and at the tap is another wide coping
of wood. Some of these buildings are partly con-
structed of alternate courses of black and white
marble.

Hdds, or watering-places for beasts of burden,
are also very numerous in Cairo. The trough is
of stone, and generally m an arched recess, over
which is a public schoolroom.

There are, as my brother has remarked, about
sixty or seventy Hammams, or public baths, in
Cairo. Some are exclusively for men, some only
for women: others, for men in the morning, and
for. women in the afternoon. When the bath is
appropriated to. women, a piece of white cotton is
hung over the door. The apartments are paved
with marble, have fountains and tanks, and are
surmounted by cupolas, pierced with small round
holes for the admission of light.

The last of the buildings I shall mention are the
Kahwehs, or coffee-amps, of which Cairo contains
above a thousand. Only coffee is supplied at these;
the persons who frequent them taking their own
pipes and tobacco.
