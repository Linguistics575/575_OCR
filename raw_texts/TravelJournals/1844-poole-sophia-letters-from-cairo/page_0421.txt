ornament undoubtedly borrowed from the Christians; and
it is surprising that Mohammedan women should wear it,
and give it this appellation. It is a little round and slender
piece of wood, rather smaller towards the extremities than
in the middle, enclosed in a case of gold, of the same form,
composed of two pieces which unite in the middle, having
two chains and a hook by which to suspend it, and a row of
bark along the bottom. It is worn in the place of, or with,
the two ornaments just before described.

The “ misht” (or comb) is a little comb of gold, worn in
the same manner as the three kinds of ornament described
next before this, and generally with one or more of those
ornaments. It - is suspended by small chains and a hook,
having four or ﬁve bark attached.

There is also an ornament somewhat similar to those just
mentioned, composed of a cornelian, or a piece of crystal or
of colourless glass, set in gold, suspended by two chains and a
hook, and having bark attached to the bottom. The former
kind is called “ ’akeek” (which signiﬁes “ oomelian”), and the
latter, “ belloor” (“ crys ").

Several ornaments in the shapes of ﬂowers, butterﬂies, &o.
are also worn upon the head-dress; but seldom alone.

01‘ ear-rings (“ halak”) there is a great variety. Some of
the more usual kinds are here represented. The ﬁrst is of
a diamond set insilver. It consistsof adrop suspended
within a wreath hanging from a sprig. The back of the silver
is gilt, to prevent its being tarnished by perspiration. The
specimen here given is that for the right ear: its fellow is
similar; .but with the sprig reversed. This pair of ear-rings
is suited for a lady of wealth—So also is the second, which
resembles the former, excepting that it has a large pearl in
