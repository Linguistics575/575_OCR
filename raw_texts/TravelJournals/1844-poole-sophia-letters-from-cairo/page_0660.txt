Sheabeh married eighty women in the course of his life ;*
and several more remarkable instances of the love of
change are recorded by Arab writers: the most extraor-
dinary case of this kind that I have met with was that of
Mohammad Ibn Et-Teiyib, the dyer, of Baghdad, who
died in the year of the Flight 423, aged eighty-ﬁve
years; of whom it is related, on most respectable au-
thority, that he married more than nine hundred women it
Supposing, therefore, that he married his ﬁrst wife when
he was ﬁfteen years of age, he must have had, on the
average, nearly thirteen wives per annum. The women,
in general, cannot of course marry so many successive
husbands, not only because a woman cannot have more
than one husband at a time, but also because she cannot
divorce her husband. There have been, however, many
instances of Arab women who have married a surprising
number of men in rapid succession. Among these may
be mentioned Umm Kharijeh, who gave occasion to a
proverb on this subject. This woman, who was of the
tribe of Bejeeleh, in El-Yemen, married upwards of
forty husbands; and her son Kharijeh knew not who
was his father. She used to contract a marriage in the
quickest possible manner: a man saying to her, “ Khit-
bun ” (betrothal), she replied, “ Nik-hun” (marriage),
and thus became his lawful wife. She had a very nume-
rous progeny; several tribes originating from here}:

For the choice of a wife, amen generally relies on
his mother, or some other near female relation, or a pro-
fessional female betrother (who is called “ khatibeh”);
