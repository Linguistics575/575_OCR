used by inferior performers.

The Arab music is generally of a soft and plaintive
character, and particularly that of the most reﬁned
description, which is distinguished by a remarkable pe-

admired; and delights in a trilling style. The airs of
songs are commonly very short and simple, adapted°to a
single verse, or even to a single hemistich; but in the
instrumental music there is more variety.

the form of a small ﬂag. The ﬂap, which is about six
or seven inches in width, and somewhat more in length,
is composed of split palm-leaves of various colours, or
some plain and others coloured, neatly plaited or woven
together. The handle is a piece of palm-stick, about
twice the length of the ﬂap. This fan is used by men as
well as women, and for the double purpose of moderating
the heat and repelling the ﬂies, which in warm weather
are excessively annoying. It is more effective than the
ordinary European fan, and requires less exertion.
Arabian fans of the kind here described, brought from
Mekkeh to Cairo as articles of merchandise, may be
purchased in the latter city for a sum less than a penny
each; they are mostly made in the Hejaz. Another

of large dimensions, and ornamented with a small piece
