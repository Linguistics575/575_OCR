ﬁrst, that I need not describe them. Some of the
Pasha’s pipes were brought to the visitors in the
room appropriated to Eur0peans, and refreshments
served as before. The buﬁ'oon, this night, was
dressed as a Frank, but seemed to be ashamed of
his disguise, for he was less lively.

“ 0n the third night, after the usual perform-
ances of the gink, a hawee, or performer of slight-
of-hand tricks, amused the company. The chief
of his juggling performances was the putting a
number of slips of white paper into a saucepan
placed on a boy’s head, and then taking them out
dyed of various colours. N o pipes were brought
to the Europeans’ room this night, because one of
the mouth-pieces, which were all very costly, had
been stolen the night before, though evidently not
by one of the visitors, for it was aﬁcrwards found
in a room to which the Europeans had not access.
Refreshments, however, were served as on the pre-
ceding nights, and more attention was given to
amuse the company in this room. A military
band with the ordinary Egyptian instruments,
came up, and played and sang several native airs;
the buﬁ'oon accompanying them with his casta-
gnettes and drolleries. They were succeeded by a
Turkish band, whose plaintive music was pleasing,
but tame and poor after that of the Egyptians.
Then a party of hired native musicians performed
for nearly an hour, and in the best style.
