The streets are unpaved, and very narrow,
generally from ﬁve to ten feet wide. Some are
even less than four feet in width; but there are
others as much as forty or ﬁfty feet wide, though
not for any great length. I must describe the
streets under their different appellations.

A sharé’, or great thoroughfare-street, is gene-
rally somewhat irregular both in its direction and
width. In most parts the width is scarcely more
than sufﬁcient for two loaded camels to proceed at
a time; and hence much inconvenience is often
occasioned to the passenger, though carriages are
very rarely encountered. All burdens are borne
by camels, if too heavy for asses; and vast num-
bers of the former, as well as many of the latter,
are employed in supplying the inhabitants of Cairo
with the water of the Nile, which is conveyed in
skins, the camel carrying a pair of skin bags, and
the ass a goat-skin, tied round at the neck. The
great thoroughfare-streets being often half ob-
structed by these animals, and generally crowded
with passengers, some on foot, and others riding,
present striking scenes of bustle and confusion,
particularly when two long trains of camels happen
to meet each other where there is barely room
enough for them to pass, which is often the case.
Asses are in very general use, and most convenient
for riding through such streets as those of Cairo,

and are always to be procured for hire. They
