sions, a little larger and handsomer; and a third merely to
wear in bed.-—-The other kind of kurs, “ kurs dahab” (or,
of gold), is a convex plate of very thin embossed gold, usu-
ally of the form represented above; and almost always with
a false emerald (a piece of green glass), not cut with facets,
set in the centre. Neither the emerald nor the ruby is here

The knssah is an ornament generally from seven to eight

decorate the bier of a female. The former, like the latter, is
worn by females of the higher and middle classes.

“ ’Enebeh” is another name for the same kind of orna-
ment, worn in the same manner. If of full size, it is four-
. teen or ﬁfteen inches in length; and rather more than half
encircles the head-dress.

The “ shawateh” (in the, singular, “ shateh”) are two
ornaments, each consisting of three or more strings of pearls,
about the length of the kussah, with a pierced emerald uniting
them in the centre, like the usual pearl necklace hereafter
described; or they are composed of pearls arranged in the
manner of a narrow lace, and alien with the addition of a
few small emeralds. They are attached to the rabtah in the
