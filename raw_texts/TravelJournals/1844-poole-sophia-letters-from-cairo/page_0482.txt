22 THE ENGLIBHWOMAN IN EGYPT.

seldom fail to ﬁnd themselves victims of abominable
tyranny; as Sir John Malcolm, in his delightful
‘ Sketches of Persia,’ has very pleasantly shown to
be the case in that country.

Another cause is the want of unanimity among
the children of a Hareem in which there is a plu-
rality of mothers. The plan of allotting a distinct
suite of apartments to each wife does not separate
the children of different mothers. They meet in
the general saloons, in the gardens, and in the
courts; and the quarrels of children grow with
them into the grave disputes of youth ; while envy
and jealousy with regard to their mother’s privi-
leges, and their own, often increase to deadly
hatred. Being but half brothers and sisters, they
have not parents in common to whom t9 refer their
differences; and they nurse them in?! their own
breasts until they ﬁnd some means of-trevenging
their real or supposed wrongs. I know a great
Hareem where the children of the wives and slaves
are of all ages; some of the sons are nearly forty
years of age; some have grown to man’s estate,
and some are boys. ‘ The younger ones alone are
perfectly at liberty in the Hareem of their father:
the elder ones have their own establishments, and
seldom meet; but they are examples of envy and
discord when circumstances throw them together;
and their feuds will, I doubt not, ere long give
rise to very deplorable consequences.
