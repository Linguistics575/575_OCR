APPENDIX. 165

praised thee, and said, Verilyzto God we belong, and
verily unto Him we return 1’ Then God will say,
‘ Build for my servant a house in Paradise, and name it
the House of Praise.’ ” To these traditions, which I
ﬁnd related as proofs of the advantages of marriage, the
following anecdote, which is of a similar nature, is added.
A certain man who would not take a wife, awoke one
day from his sleep, and demanded to be married, saying,
as his reason, “ I dreamt that the resurrection had taken
place, and that I was among the beings collected at the
scene of judgment, but was suffering a thirst that
stopped up the passage of my stomach; and 10, there
were youths passing through the assembly, having in
their hands ewers of silver and cups of gold, and giving
drink to one person after another; so I stretched forth
my hand to one of them, and said, ‘ Give me to drink;
for thirst overpowereth me :’ but they answered, ‘ Thou

'hast no child among us: we give drink only to our

fathers.’ I asked them, ‘ Who are ye ?' They replied,
‘ We are the deceased infant children of the Muslims.’ ”*
Especial rewards in heaven are promised to mothers.
“ When a woman conceives by her husband,” said the
PrOphct, “ she is called in heaven a martyr [:1 e. she is
ranked as a martyr in dignity] ; and her labour in child-
bed, and her care for her children, protect her from hell-
ﬁre.”1’

“ When the child begins to speak, the father should
teach him ﬁrst the kelimeh. [or profession of faith],
‘ There is no deity but God: [Mohammad is God’s
apostle]’—-he should dictate this to him seven times.
