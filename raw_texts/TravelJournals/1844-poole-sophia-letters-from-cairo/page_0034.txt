the successor of one of the most illustrious cities of
ancient times, it disappoints me, and occasions
only melancholy reﬂections.

Truly history confers a deep interest on this
spot, once the chief seat of Egyptian learning, the
theatre of many wars and bloody tragedies, the
scene of the martyrdom of St. Mark, the birth-
place and residence of many of the most eminent
fathers of the church, and the hot-bed of schisms
and heresies. But it is only in retrospect we ﬁnd
that on which our minds can rest, and which can
give rise to reﬂections which may be pursued to

advantage.
