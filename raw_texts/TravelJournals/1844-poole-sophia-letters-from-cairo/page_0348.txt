2130 THE ENGLISHWOMAN 1N EGYPT.

LETTER XXVI.

February, 1844.
MY DEAR FRIEND,

THE entrance of the Great Pyramid * is
over the sixteenth course, or layer of stone, about
ﬁfty feet above the base; a slope of rubbish, as I
said before, leading up to it.1' It is nearly in the
' centre, or equidistant from either angle of the
northern side of the pyramid : the eye would
hardly discover that it is not exactly so; though
really twenty feet, or rather more, to the eastward
of the centre. The opening of the pyramid seems
to have been attended with considerable difﬁculty ;
a vast number of stones having been torn down
above and before the aperture. An inclined plane
before the entrance forms an angle of twenty-six
degrees and a half with the horizon, being in the
same place with the ﬂoor of the ﬁrst passage. The
size of the stones above the entrance, and the man-
ner in which they are disposed, are worthy of
remark. There is no granite at the entrance of
the pyramid ; all the blocks are of limestone.
