the Delta side) of one of the most famous rivers in
the world.

The boats of the Nile are admirably constructed
for the navigation of that river. Thei‘r great tri-
angular sails are managed with extraordinary fa-
cility, which is an advantage of the utmost im-
portance; for the sudden and frequent gusts of
wind to which they are subject, require that a sail
should be taken in almost in a moment, or the
vessel would most probably be overset. On many
occasions one side of our boat was completely
under water, but the men are so skilful that an
accident seldom happens, unless travellers pursue
the voyage during the night.

We ordered that our boat should not proceed at
night, therefore we were three days on the Nile.

A custom which is always observed by the
Arab boat-men at the commencement of a voyage
much pleased me. As soon as the wind had ﬁlled
our large sail, the Reyyis (or captain of the boat)
exclaimed “ El-Fat-’hah.” This is the title of the
opening chapter of the Kur-’an (a short and sim-
ple prayer), which the Reyyis and all the crew
repeated together in a low tone of voice. Would
to Heaven that, in this respect, the example of the
poor Muslim might be followed by our country-
men, that our entire dependence on the protecting
providence of God might be universally acknow-
ledged, and every journey, and every voyage, be
sanctiﬁed by prayer.
