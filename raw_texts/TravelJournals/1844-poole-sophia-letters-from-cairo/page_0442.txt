Meantime Mohammad ’Alee continued to keep up his army
and navy, sent oﬁcers to be instructed in ship-building in
the English dock-yards, had a French oﬁicer of distinction
to discipline his army, and a French Admiral at the head of
his ﬂeet. His government of Syria was exceedingly Oppres-

began to break out in 1834, in the Haouran, and afterwards
