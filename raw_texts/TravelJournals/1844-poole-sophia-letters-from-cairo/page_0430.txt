worn. Brass rings, with pieces of coloured glass- set in
them, may be purchased in Cairo for scarcely more than a
farthing each; and many women wear two, three, or more,
of these. '

The “ asawir,” or bracelets, are of various kinds. Some
are of silver; and some of brass or copper; and of the same
form as those of gold before described. Those of brass are
the more common. There are also bracelets composed of
large amber beads, and others of bone; and there is a very
common kind, called “ ghuweyshat,” of opaque, coloured
glass, generally blue or green, but sometimes variegated
with other colours. These, and the bone bracelets, are
drawn over the hand.

Some of the women of the lower orders imitate their su-
periors in arranging their hair in several plai ts, and plaiting,
with each of these, the black silk strings which are worn
by the ladies; but it is the general practice of the women of
these classes to divide their hair into only two tresses be-
hind, and to plait, with each of these tresses, three red silk
strings, each of which has a tassel at the end, and reaches
more than half way towards the ground; so that they are
usually obliged to draw aside the tassel before they sit down.
These appendages are called “ ’okoos.”

“ Khulkhal,” or anklets of solid silver, already described,
are worn by the wives of some of the richer peasants, and of
the sheykhs of villages; and small khulkhals of iron are
worn by many children. It was also a common custom
among the Arabs, for girls or young women to wear a string
of bells on their feet. I have seen many little girls in Cairo
with small round bells attached to their anklets. Perhaps
it is to the sound of ornaments of this kind, rather than that
of the more common anklet, that Isaiah alludes in chapter
iii. verse 16.
