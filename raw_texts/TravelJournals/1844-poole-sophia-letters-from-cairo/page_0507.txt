being disappointed, adapted this method of revenge.
This was related to me as a true story, well at-
tested. One more will perhaps be as much as you

A man went to the market to sell a calf, and a
company of thieves, forty in number, with their.
chief, agreed to buy it under the name of a kid.
So their chief came to the owner of the calf, and.
asked him, “ Wilt thou sell this kid for ﬁfteen
piastres ?” The owner replied, “ It is a calf, not a
kid.” Then ten of the thieves said, “ O sheykh;
it is a kid, not a calf: art thou blind?” and they--
went away. Then came ten others of them, who
offered him fourteen piastres, each of them saying;
“ It is a kid, nota calf ;” he replying “ It is acalf,
not a kid: are ye blind?” So the man was per-
plexed, and he looked at the calf, and felt its head,
and its back, and its tail. One party of the
thieves after another continued to come to him,
each lessening theprice; but he would not sell it.
Then their chief came to him, and said to him,
“ Wilt thou sell this kid for seventeen piastres ?”
but he refused.. And the chief said, “ I have
guests with me, and I have ~offered thee more than-
the kid is worth, because I desired to slaughter it
for them.” But still he would not. And the
chief said, “ Wilt thou sell it for twenty?” He
answered, " I will, on the condition that than give
me its tail.” And he replied “ Granted.” 80‘
