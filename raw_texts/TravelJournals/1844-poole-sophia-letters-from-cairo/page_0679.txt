The prohibition of wine, or rather, of fermented and
intoxicating liquors, being one of the most remarkable
and important points of the Mohammadan religion, it
might be imagined that the frequent stories in the
Thousand and One Nights, describing parties of Mus.-
lims as habitually indulging in the use of forbidden
beverages, are scandalous misrepresentations of Arab
manners and customs. There are, however, many
similar anecdotes interspersed in the worlss of Arab
historians, which (though many of them are probably
untrue in their application to particular individuals) could
not have been offered to the public by such writers if
they were not of a nature consistent with the customs of
a considerable class of the Arab nation.

In investigating this subject, it is necessary, in the ﬁrst
place, to state, that there is a kind of wine which Mus-
lims are permitted to drink. It is properly called
“ nebeedb ” (a name which is now given to prohibited
kinds of wine), and is generally prepared by putting dry
grapes, or dry dates, in water, to extract their sweetness,
and suffering the liquor to ferment slightly, until it
acquires a little sharpness or pungency. The Prophet
himself was in the habit of drinking wine of this kind,
which was prepared for him in the ﬁrst part of the night;
he drank it on the ﬁrst and second days following; but
if any remained on the morning of the third day, be either
gave it to his servants or ordered it to be poured out upon
the ground.‘ Such beverages have, therefore, been
drunk by the strictest of his followers; and Ibn Khaldoon
strongly argues that nebeedb thus prepared from dates
was the kind of wine used by the Khalefehs Hdroon Er-
