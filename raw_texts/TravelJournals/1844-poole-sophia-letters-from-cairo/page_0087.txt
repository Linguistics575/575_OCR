most violent ever witnessed. It lasted less than
half an hour, and a very violent samoom seldom
continues longer. My brother is of opinion that,
although it is extremely distressing, it can never
prove fatal, unless to persons already brought
almost to the point of death by disease, fatigue,
thirst, or some other cause. The poor camel
seems to suffer from it equally with his master;
and will often lie down with his back to the wind,
close his eyes, stretch out his long neck upon the
ground, and so remain until the storm has passed
over.

Another very remarkable phenomenon is the
“ Zdba’a ,” and very common in Egypt, and in
the adjacent deserts. It is a whirlwind, which
raises the sand or dust in the form of a pillar,
generally of immense height.’ These whirling
pillars of sand (of which my brother has seen
more than twelve in one day, and often two or
three at a time during the spring) are carried

" “ I measured ” (says my brother) “ the height of a
zéba’ah, with a sextant, at Thebes, under circumstances
which insured a very near approximation to perfect accuracy
(observing its altitude from an elevated spot, at the precise
moment when it passed through, and violently agitated, a
distant group of palm-trees), and found it to be seven hundred
and ﬁfty feet. I think that several zo'ba’ahs I have seen
were of greater height. Others which I measured at the
same place were between ﬁve and seven hundred feet in
height.”—Modern Egyptians, 3rd Edition, Part I. chap. 1.
