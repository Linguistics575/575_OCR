14th, or one of the ﬁve following days of the
month of Misra (the 19th to the 24th of August) ;
this is when the dam of earth which closes the
entrance of the canal of Cairo is broken down; it
having been ﬁrst announced that the river has
risen (in the latitude of the metropolis) sixteen

Coptic year; corresponding with the 10th or 11th
of September, according as ﬁve or six intercalary

successive years; and six at the end of the fourth year.
The Coptic leap-year immediately precedes ours: therefore,
the Coptic year begins on the 11th of September, only when
it is the next after their leap-year; or when our next ensu-

ing February, the corresponding days of the Coptic and our
months will be the same as in other years. The COPts
begin their reckoning from the era of Diocletian, A.D. 284.”
