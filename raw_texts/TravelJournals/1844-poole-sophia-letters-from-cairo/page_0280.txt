described to you, or a spray, very much resembling

is placed at the division of the tassel, which latter is
often so broad when spread, as to extend an inch
beyond the head on either side in a front view.

parts on the forehead. The long hair is disposed
in numerous small plaits, and looped up on either

long hair ﬂowing on their shoulders, and, in
some instances, their attractions are considerably
heightened by this simplicity; but no cog'ﬂ'ure,
however studied, or simple, is so pretty as that ‘

down the back is arranged in many small plaits
often lengthened by silk braid, and generally adorned
with hundreds of small gold ornaments, resembling
oval spangles, which harmonize better with the
Eastern costume than any other fashion.
