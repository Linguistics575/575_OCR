LETTER II.

‘March, 1845.

SOME of my countrymen seem to be inclined to
regard with approbation, in several respects, the

laws and customs relating to marriage, and the-

separation of the sexes, as prevailing in "this and
other Muslim countries. I think that my brother
(who is not one of the persons above alluded to)
has pointed out the chief advantages resulting from
this state of things. After remarking that “ The
respect in which trade is held by the Muslim
greatly tends to.enlarge the circle of his acquaint-
ance with persons of different ranks,” he adds,
“ freedom of intercourse with his fellow-men is
further and very greatly promoted by the law of
the separation of the sexes, as it enables him to
associate with others, regardless of difference of
wealth or station, without the risk of occasioning
unequal matrimonial connexions. The women,
like the men, enjoy extensive intercourse with per-
sons of their own sex.”* Hence they enjoy a do-
mestic quiet unknown to us, in general, in the
West; and much more might doubtless be said in
the way of apology for these laws and customs:
