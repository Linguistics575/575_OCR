anecdote. The founder, on the ﬁrst occasion of
opening his mosque for the ceremonials of the
Friday prayers, invited the chief ’Ulama to attend
the service, and each of these congratulated him
before the congregation, by reciting some tradition
of the Prophet, or by some other words of an ap-
posite nature, excepting one. This man the
founder addressed, asking wherefore he was silent.
“ Hast thou nothing to say,” he asked, “ beﬁtting
this occasion?” The man thus invited readily an-
swered, “ Yes. If thou hast built this mosque with
money lawfully acquired, and with a good inten-
tion, know that God hath built for thee a mansion
in Paradise, and great will be thy felicity. But if
thou raised this temple by means of wealth unlaw-
fully obtained, by money exacted from the poor by
oppression and tyranny, know that there is pre-
pared for thee a place in hell, and evil will be the
tramit thither.” The latter was the case; and
within a few hours after he had thus spoken, the
only one among the company of ’Ulama who had
dared to utter the language of truth on this occa-
sion—to do which, indeed, required no little cou-
rage—suddenly died, a victim, as was well known,
of poison.
