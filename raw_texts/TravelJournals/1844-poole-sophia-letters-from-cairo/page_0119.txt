THE ENGLISHWOMAN IN EGYPT. 131

verted, this town was plundered, and partly de-
stroyed by ﬁre; and it is said that the great
famine in the reign of El-Mustansir destroyed all
its inhabitants, leaving it to fall to ruin. Its site
has become included within the suburbs of Cairo,
and its great mosque, founded by Ibn Tooloon, yet
remains.

The site of another town, which was called El-
Maks, and which existed before the conquest of
Egypt by the Arabs, is also now included within
the suburban districts of Cairo. Medeenet El—Ka-
hireh (the city of El-Kahireh or Cairo) originally
occupied a space about three quarters of a mile
square. It was founded in the year of the Flight
358 (A.D. 968-9). The ﬁrst wall was pulled down
in the year 480 (A.D. 1087-8), and a new one
built, which included a small additional space on
the north and south. This was pulled down in
the year 572 (11.1). 1176-7), and the citadel and
a third wall were built by Salah-ed-Deen (the Sala-
din of European historians). The third wall ex-
tended, from the citadel, along the eastern and
northern sides of the metropolis, partly encom-
passing El-Maks, on the western side of which it
terminated, being left unﬁnished. It was the in-
tention of its builder to have made it to surround
Cairo and the citadel, and El-Fustat. The sub-
urbs of Cairo have become much more extensive
than the original city.
