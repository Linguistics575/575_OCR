68 THE axemsnwouau IN EGYPT.

tance, while a few musicians make what is consi

dered melody with drums and shrill hautboys, and
attending females scream their zagh tireet (or qua-
vering cries of joy), in deafening discord in her train.

The funeral processions distress me. The corpse
of a man is carried in an open bier, with merely a
shawl thrown over the body, through which the
form is painfully visible. The body of ‘ a woman
is carried in a covered bier over which a shawl is
laid; and an upright piece of wood, covered also
with a shawl and decorated with ornaments belong-
ing to the female head-dress, rises from the fore-'
part. The corpses of children are borne on this
latter kind of bier.

One sound that I heard as a funeral procession
approached, I can never forget; it was a cry of
such deep sorrow—a sob of such heartfelt distress,
that it was clearly distinguished from the wail of
the hired women who joined the funeral chorus. We
were immediately drawn to the windows, and saw a
man leading a procession of women, and bearing in
his arms a little dead infant, wrapt merely in a shawl,
and travelling to its last earthly home. The cry
of agony proceeded, I conclude, from its mother,
and could only be wrung from a nearly bursting
heart. Contend against me who may, I must ever
maintain my opinion, that no love is so deep, no
attachment so strong, as that of mother to child,
and of child to mother.
