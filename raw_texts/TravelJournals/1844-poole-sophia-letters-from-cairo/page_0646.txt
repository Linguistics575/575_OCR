nudity, and are allowed to commit, with impunity, acts
of brutal sensuality which the law, when appealed to,
should punish with death. Such practices are forbidden
‘by the religion and law even in the cases of saints; but
common and deeply-rooted superstition prevents their
punishment. During the occupation of Egypt by the
French, the Commander-in-chief, Menou, applied to
the Sheykhs (or ’Ulama) of the city for their Opinion
“ respecting those persons who were accustomed -to go
about in the streets in a state of nudity, crying out and
screaming, and arrogating to themselves the dignity of
wilayeh, relied upon as saints by the generality of the
people, neither performing the prayers of the Muslims
nor fasting,” asking whether such conduct was permitted
by the religion, or contrary to the ‘law. He was
answered, “ Conduct of this description is forbidden,
and repugnant to our religion and law, and to our tradi-
tions.” The French General thanked them for this
answer, and gave orders to prevent such practices in
ﬁxture, and to seize every one seen thus offending; if
insane, to conﬁne him in the Maaristan (or hospital and
lunatic asylum) ; and if not insane, to compel him either
to relinquish his disgusting habits or to leave the city!—
Of reputed saints of this kind, thus writes an enlightened
poet, El—Bedree El-Hejazee :—

“ Would that I had not lived to see every fool esteemed among
men as a Kutb l
Their learned men take him as a patron; nay, even a: Lord, in
place of the Pcsseaor of Heaven‘s throne.
