run mamanwom IN EGYPT. 31

The embroidery which is done in the hareems is
very superior to any other, and frequently inter-
spersed with precious stones, generally diamonds,
pearls, emeralds, and rubies. The rich large bro-
cade trowsers often are richly ornamented with
jewels, and are stiff with decorations; but the Sal-
tah (a small jacket) for chasteness and elegance is
that which I most admire of all the embroidered
articles of dress. For winter wear, it is of velvet,
or ﬁne cloth, lined with silk. Saltahs of rich silk
are worn during the autumn and spring ;" and,
during the summer, dresses of European muslin are
almost universally adopted, and are the only kind of
apparel suited to the intense heat of an Egyptian
summer.

Few of the ladies can read and write even their
own language. I know, however, some exceptions.
In one family, the daughters have been extremely
well instructed by their brother, whose education
was completed in Europe. In their library are to
be found the works of the ﬁrst Italian poets and
the best literature of Turkey ; and these they not
only read, but understood.
