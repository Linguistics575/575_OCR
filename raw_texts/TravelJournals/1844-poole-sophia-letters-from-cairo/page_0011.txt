The windows of our hotel command a view of
the great square, and I can scarcely describe to
you the picturesque attraction of the scene.
Among the various peculiarities of dress, feature,
and complexion, which characterize the natives of
Africa and the East, none are more striking than
those which distinguish the noble and hardy west-
ern Bedawee, enveloped as he is in his ample
woollen shirt, or hooded cloak, and literally
clothed suitably for a Russian winter. You will
believe that my attention has been directed to the
veiled women, exhibiting in their dull disguise no
other attraction than a degree of stateliness in their
carriage, and a remarkable beauty in their large
dark eyes, which, besides being sufﬁciently distin-
guished by nature, are rendered more conspicuous
by the black border of kohl round the lashes, and
by the concealment of the rest of the features.
The camel-drivers’ cries of “ O’a,” “ Guarda,” and
“ Sikin,” resound every where, and at every mo-
ment, therefore, you may imagine the noise and
confusion in the streets.
