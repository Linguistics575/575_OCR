Arab dancers, and a full Arab band, ﬁlled up the
hours. At one o’clock breakfast was prepared, and
the mother of Mohammad ’Alee presided. Much

was so quietly and so well arranged for the many
hundreds who visited the palace, that it was matter
of surprise to me how it was managed. Had the
entertainment been Turkish, there were too many
hands to prepare it ; but being entirely European,
the inmates of the Hareem could only help as they

group of Turkish dancers ; they were succeeded by
the ’A’lmehs, who danced and sang alternately.
During their performances, eight interesting-look-

ing a signal for beginning their lively dance. They
were dressed in black Cashmere richly embroidered
with gold, and they wore black silk caps, each with
