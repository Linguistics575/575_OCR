form of two festoons, one on each side of the head, from the
extremity of the kussah to the back part of the head-dress,
or, sometim%, to the ear-ring.

Instead of the kussah and shawateh, and sometimes in
addition to them, are worn some other ornaments which I
proceed to describe.

The “ reesheh” (literally, “ feather”) is a sprig of dia-
monds set in gold or silver. It is worn on the front or side
of the head-dress.

The “ hilal” is a crescent of diamonds set in gold or silver,
and worn like the reesheh. In form it resembles the phasis
of the moon when between two and three nights old; its
width being small, and its outward edge not more than half

The “ kamarah” (or moon) is an ornament formed of a
thin plate of gold, embossed with fanciful work, and some-
times with Arabic words, and having about seven little ﬂat
pieces of gold, called “ bark,” attached to the lower part; or
it is composed of gold with diamonds, rubies, 8w. Two
specimens of the former kind are represented in the following
page. One of these consists of three kamarahs connected
together, to be worn on the front of the head-dress: the cen---
tral contains the words “ Ya Kafee Ya Shafee” (O Sufﬁcient !.
O Restorer to health l): that on the left, “ Ya Hafiz” (O
Preserver I): that on the right, “ Ya Emeen” (0 Trust--
worthy!) : these, therefore, are charms as well as ornaments-

The “ sakiyeh” (or water-wheel), so called from its form,.
is a circular ﬂat ornament of gold ﬁligree-work, with small?
pearls, and with a diamond or other precious stone in the-
centre, and bark and emeralds suspended from the lower part.
It is worn in the same manner as the kamarah, or with the
latter ornament.

The ‘."ood es-salecb” (or wood of the cross) is a kind of
