the Great Pyramid, and all the details are minutely
attended to and beautifully executed. There is
also, among the more ancient of the curiosities in
this most rare collection, a bracelet of twisted gold,
terminating with the form of the lotus-ﬂower, very
much resembling the picturesque bracelets worn
by the ladies of Egypt in the present day, only
that it is, strange to say, of superior workmanship.
I was much pleased also with two beautiful gold
ﬁgures of birds with human heads and extended
wings, representing the departing soul. Some
winged orbs, too, symbols of the good genius, are
remarkable for the ﬁne taste and exquisite work-
manship displayed in their formation. Some little
ﬁgures in lapis lazuli are curious specimens of
beautiful ancient carving; and two bronze lizards
excited my admiration most especially: they are
in as perfect preservation as though ﬁnished but
yesterday, and wonderfully true to nature.
