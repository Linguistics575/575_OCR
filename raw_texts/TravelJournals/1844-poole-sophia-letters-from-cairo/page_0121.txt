THE ENGLISHWOMAN IN EGYPT. 135

The city which is known to Europeans by the
name of Cairo, or Grand Cairo, is called by
the Egyptians Masr ;"' and in letters and other
writings, the epithet El-MahroosehT (or The
Guarded) is generally added. El-Kahir (or the
planet Mars), an unpropitious star, being the
ascendant at the period of its foundation, it was
originally called El-Kahirehﬁ: whence the Italian-
ized name Cairo. It was founded at night.
Astrologers had been consulted and had ﬁxed on a
propitious moment for laying the foundations of
the city-wall. They were to have given a signal
at that precise moment by ringing a number of
bells, which were suspended to cords supported by
poles, along the whole circumference of the in-
tended wall; but a raven happening to alight upon
one of the cords, the bells were put in motion be-
fore the chosen time; and the builders, who were
waiting for the signal, immediately commenced
their work—thus the city was founded at an in-
auspicious instead of a fortunate moment.§

* The Turks, and many other oriental foreigners, pro-
nounce it Misr, and thus it is pronounced in the literary dia-
lect of Arabic.

'f In government documents, this epithet is oﬁen used
alone to designate the Egyptian metropolis.

I El-Kéhir and El-Kahireh (masc. and fem.) signify
victorious.
