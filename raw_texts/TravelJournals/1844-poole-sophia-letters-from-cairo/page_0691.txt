“ The season has become pleasant I The time of the rose is come!

When he resumed his work, he made it known by sing-
ing aloud——

“ If my lord prolong my life until the rose-season, I will take
again my morning potations; but if I die before it,alasl for
the loss ofthe rose and wine!

“ I implore the God of the supreme throne, whose glory he extolled,

that my heart may continually enjoy the evening potatlons to
the day of resurrection."

this man, that be granted him an annual pension of ten
thousand dirhems to enable him to enjoy himself amply
on these occasions.*——Another anecdote may be added to
show the estimation of the rose in the mind of an Arab.
It is said that Bowh Ibn Hatim, the governor of the
province of Northern Africa, was sitting one day, with a
female slave, in an apartment of his palace, when a
eunuch brought him a jar full of red and white roses,
which a man had offered as a present. He ordered the
eunuch to ﬁll the jar with silver in return ; but his eon-

towards the man; for his present to thee is of two
colours, red and white.” The Emeer replied, “ Thou
hast said truly ;” and gave orders to ﬁll the jar for him
with silver and gold (dirhems and deenars) intermixed?

year, in the following manner :——Tbey take a number of
rose-buds, and ﬁll with them a new earthen jar, and,
