APPEND 1x. 2 l l

The “ ’ekd,” or necklace, is generally of ' a style similar
to those which I have already described. I have before
mentioned that the libbeh and sha’eer are worn by some
women of the lower orders; but their necklaces are most
comatonly composed of coloured glass beads; sometimes,
of a single string; and sometimes, of several strings, with
one or more larger beads in the centre: or they are made in
the form of net-work. The Egyptian women, being exces-
sively fond of ornaments, often wear two or three necklaces
of the value of a penny each, or less. Some necklaces are
composed of large beads of transparent amber.

Another ornament worn by many of them on the neck is
a ring, called “ tok,” of silver or brass or pewter. Little
girls, also, sometimes wear this ornament. Some of the
smaller to’ks are made of iron.
