MY DEAR FRIEND,

Yoomustbecrwithmeiflreeurto the
subject of the haunted house, for our disturbances
came to a. sort of climax which I think as curious
as it was exciting, and so strikingly characteristic,
that I must describe to you the particulars. of the
case.
Ramadan ended about a month ago, and with it
ended the comparative quiet of our nights. To
describe to you all the various noises by which we
have been disturbed is impossible. Very fre-
quently the door of the room in which we were
sitting late in the evening, within two or three
hours of midnight, was violently knocked at many
short intervals: at other times, it seemed as if
something very heavy fell upon the pavement close
under one of the windows of the same room, or of
one adjoining, and as these rooms were on the top
of the house, we imagined at ﬁrst that some stones
or other things had been thrown by a neighbour,
but we could ﬁnd nothing outside after the noises
