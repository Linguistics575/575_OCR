doms that had worn away Egypt with their jealousies
abolished, by the strong hand of Psametik, the father
of N echo.

Museum of Naples there is a curious votive tablet of
an Egyptian priest. He had obeyed the Persians and
gone to Asia in their service. He thanks Chnum, of
whom we recollect the god of Hanes to have been a
