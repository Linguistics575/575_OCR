polite kings, and the absence of monuments at Memphis
implies the decay of that city and the transfer of the
capital. This age is wholly without remains. We do not
know if the Dynasties were contemporary (VI I. and VIII.
with IX. and X.) or successive, and the length of timc they
ﬁlled is unknown.
IV.
THEBAN KINGDOM.

(Dyn'. Xl., XIl., XIII.)—Capital, Thebes; at ﬁrst pro-
vincial, afterwards of the whole country. The rise (XL),
the greatness (XII.), and the decliiie (XIII.) of the The-
bans is marked by the division into Dynasties. The middle
period (XI 1.) is certain (213 yrs.), the others unknown. It
is possible that the XIVth Dynasty of Xo'ftes succeeded the
Thebans and preceded the Shepherds.

V.
SHEPHERD-RULE.

(Dyn'. XV., XVI., contemporary with XVIl., Theban,
and perhaps with XIV., Xo’ites).—-Capital, loan or Tanis.
Len gth of Shepherd-rule probably 511 years; at the close
Egypt divided between (XVI.) Shepherds and (XVII.)
Thebans.

VI.
THE EMPIRE.

(Dyn'. XVIII, XlX., XX., in part.)— Capital, Thebes.

B.C. cir. 1600 to n 50.
