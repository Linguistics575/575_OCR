Baal-zephon he identiﬁes with the temple of Zeus, or
Jupiter, Casius on a headland, Mount Casius, in the strip
of land between the Mediterranean and the lake. The-
objection to these identiﬁcations is that whereas in the
Bible Migdol, Pi-hahiroth, and Baal-zephon, are all
spoken of as together, Dr. Brugsch puts Migdol and
Baal-zephon as far apart as Zoan and Migdol, and thus
he makes the last day’s march as long as the three pre-
ceding stages. Again, he makes the change of route to
avoid the way of the Philistines, from the headland of
Mount Casius across the Serbonian Lake by an isthmus.
But the change took place before the last encampment
near Migdol, not after it, and Mr. Greville Chester
has shown that Dr. Brugsch’s isthmus is purely im-
aginary. He travelled by the strip of coast to test
the theory, and found it failed (Quart. Statement
Pal. Ex. Fund, July 1880, p. 154). So far for the
sites. With respect to the event, Dr. Brugsch holds
that the Israelites passed between the sea and the
lake by a practicable route, whereas the Egyptian army
perished by the overﬂow of the ocean, an event of

extremely rare occurrence ; and this view seems contrary
