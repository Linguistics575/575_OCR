the close of the reign of Philopator, an independent
dynasty was established, which was overthrown by
Epiphanes. The Thebans rose once more against
Lathyrus. The patriotic party made their last stand in
the old city, which endured a three years’ siege, but
was at length taken and dealt with by the successful king
according to his ruthless temper. This was the end of
the City of Thrones, since represented only by scattered
villages about the temples.

The ﬁnal decline of Thebes before the fall of
paganism, and' the distance of any later rival, have
saved the monuments from being used, like those of
Memphis, for the building materials of successive
capitals. Thus in the early part of this century the
aspect of the site must have been little changed from
that which it presented when Ptolemy Lathyrus drew
off his vindictive forces. The industry in detail of the
ignorant tourist, who labours like the rat and the worm,
has worked more mischief than any force of nature;
and ﬁfty years of systematic spoliation has been more
injurious than the swiﬁ: rage of conquerors. Yet nearly
all the great ediﬁces yet stand, and the sequence of

pictures in the royal tombs can still be followed.
