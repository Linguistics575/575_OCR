HANES. 45

 

Egypt, and has appealed to English sympathy to carry
out researches which are of European interest. Great as
is the importance of the one site here noticed, there are
many others to which it must yield. Classical scholars
must remember the old settlement of the trading Greeks
at Naucratis, where the unearthing of the smallest
fragment of pottery or glass would supply a link between
the civilisations and the art of the northern and the
southern coasts of the Mediterranean. Students of the
Bible will not forget the land of Goshen, full of the
hidden records of the Hebrew ages, Zoan the capital of
Joseph’s Pharaoh, the residence of the Pharaoh of the
Exodus. To Goshen and to Zoan Mariette has markedly
pointed in the scheme which he has bequeathed us,
speaking with that foresight which seems to give a deep
signiﬁcance to the last words of one who has worked in
earnest, and would tell us not what he has done, but
what remains to be achieved. His best memorial will
be the carrying through of this well-bonsidered scheme.
A noble work will then go on unchecked to due fulﬁl-

ment.
