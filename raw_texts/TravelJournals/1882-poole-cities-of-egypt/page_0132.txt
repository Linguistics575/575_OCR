sea, which has ruined Winchelsea and impoverished Rye.
Beyond the historic limits we may trace still more
ancient shore-lines at higher levels. The whole fen-
country is an instance of the same reclamation of land
on a much'larger scale. Not that this has been regular
and without intermission for ages. We must remember
that once the Channel was bridged by an isthmus, and
Britain and Gaul were one, just as north-western Africa
was joined to Spain at the very time when the Great
Desert, the Sahara, was a sea. We need not, however,
