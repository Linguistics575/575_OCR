opposite to Syene, the border-town on the south; Samut,
as just remarked, still holds its place on the map. The

must have grown around it, for it received a colony of
fugitive Jews in the time of Jeremiah (xliv. 1). Under
the Pharaohs it had been apparently the most important
fort on the eastern frontier, but in the later days of the
monarchy, the great danger of attack by sea raised the
consequence of Pelusium or Sin, which became ‘ the
strength of Egypt’ (Ezek. xxx. I 5).

We will now endeavour to trace the Israelite route
on the map. From Zoan to near Migdol the distance in
