PI-BESETH. I65

 

Bridge, a few miles inland, in his last battle he faced the
traitor Modred and the heathen host. So far may be
history, but the passing of the king and the casting of
Excalibur into such a mere as may be seen from the
heights of the granite-capped mountains, these are mere
fancies, delighting the imagination but baﬂiing the desire
for two records. In Egypt all is pure history. Each
fresh discovery rescues the subjects of legend from its
misty realm. Within the memory of living men, the
great ﬁgures of Egyptian antiquity were such shadowy
types as Sesostris, a mere embodiment of a series of
conquerors, but knowledge of the monuments has given
us the living materials out of which this Colossus of
legend was built. So too it is with the vagueness which
inevitably surrounds the early Pharaohs of Bible history,
whose names and dates are unrecorded. As each is
identiﬁed, with his great works and wise politics, it is as
if the pick of some Cornish labouring man were to strike
upon a tablet of King Arthur, in fair Latin, dated, and
with all historic circumstance. Such a thought makes _
us feel it were wise to wake from dreaming of legends,

and to arise to explore the sure ways of history.
