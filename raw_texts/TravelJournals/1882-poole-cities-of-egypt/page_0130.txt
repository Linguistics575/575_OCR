was from Rameses, identiﬁed, as already shown, with the
great city of Zoan, still retaining its name in the Arabic
Sén. The last encampment before the sea was crossed
was near Migdol, and Migdol is so well ﬁxed by classical
evidence that we may venture to say which mound in
the desert covers its remains. If we cannot point to
the sites of the two intermediate stations, Succoth and
Etham, we can draw a line from Zoan to Migdol, making
allowance in its direction for the diﬂiculties of the
country, less in the age of the Exodus than now, and we
cannot be far wrong.

We have, however, much more than this to do.
Where was the sea at this time? Did it extend to near
Migdol, of which we know the site, and was it the Red
Sea? For as we look at the map, though we can trace
a chain of lakes and marshes between the south-eastem
angle of Lake Menzeleh and the Red Sea at Suez,
