20 CITIES 0F EGYPT.

the native annalist,—Menes, the founder of Memphis
and Egyptian history, came from the south. Civilisation
descended the Nile. His native place was Thinis, or
This, in Upper Egypt, a still older town, where his
shadowy predecessors ruled. He united under his single
sway ‘ the two regions ’ of Egypt, and at once erected a
new capital, from which he could control the whole
country. The site was happily chosen, and neither the
glory of Thebes nor the trafﬁc of Alexandria ever took
away the seat of government for long— for a few centuries
only in eacthase—from the neighbourhood of the oldest
capital. It was well called ‘the balance of the two
regions.’ Where the valley of Upper Egypt is about to
spread out into the plain of the Delta, a strong city could
rule both, and hold the entrance of the narrow Upper
Country, the ﬁrst of many barriers which could stay the
advance of the invader, and so give courage to a retiring
army.

The marvel of the origin of Memphis lies in the work
that went before. Here in the beginnings of history we
picture to ourselves a rude people, whose primitive
collection of huts grew to be a city. But it was not so.

A great engineering work was the ﬁrst act of the builder.
