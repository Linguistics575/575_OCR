belief of Egypt was fatal in its effect. A religion which
had fallen into helpless decay could only disappear at
the touch of philosophy. Thus at the moment when
all its greatest thoughts were clothed in worthy form, a
deep and hopeless doubt seized on the minds of the
people, except those few who could accept the new view
without losing whatever was worth retaining in the old

thinkers received a current of Egyptian inﬂuence.

Still more remarkable was the meeting‘ of Greek and
Hebrew thought, and the share which Plato took in
their fusion. The Jews of Alexandria, dwelling in a
Greek city and speaking its language, soon needed a

desire of the second Ptolemy, but it is more reason-
able to think that it was due to the care of the Alex-
andrian sanhedrim. From that moment the logic and

thought, and suggested its deﬁnition ; from that moment
the Platonists were offered that which they had long
desired, the reality of their great leader’s noble Ideas.
