very time when Pergamus and Rhodes were showing
great originality and mastery of form. When the Greeks
at Alexandria returned to the poetry and imagination
of philosophy, art, which cannot live without a perpetual
tradition, could no longer be revived.

The ﬁrst traces of a deﬁnite school of philosophy at
Alexandria are seen where we should least exPect them.
In an Egyptian temple of the Ptolemaic age, when we
are given the key which the genius of Mariette dis-
covered, we ﬁnd ourselves in the presence of national
ideas transformed by Greek inﬂuence. The very art
has received a new impulse, and the graces of Greek
architecture, dead at Alexandria, live again in the
Theba'is under an Egyptian shape. The system of the
different parts of the ediﬁce is changed from the mere '
chance of older times to a strict method. Each hall
and chamber has its proper purpose, its suitable sculp-
tures and inscriptions, leading up from the lower stages
of knowledge to initiation into the higher truths. At
the end of the temple, in the sanctuary, the king
worships the Ideas of Plato’s philosophy, the Beautiful,
the True, and the Good.
