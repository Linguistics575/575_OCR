rank among the decisive battles of the world. Had the
Persians failed, they might never have won the command
of the Mediterranean, without which they could scarcely
have invaded Greece. Of the details of the action we
know nothing. The Egyptians were probably far out-

presence of Greek and Carian mercenaries, by whose
side they never fought their best. Yet it was a stubborn
conﬂict, but at last the Egyptian army gave way and ﬂed
in rout to Memphis. Herodotus, some seventy years after-
wards, visited the battle-ﬁeld, and saw the bones of the
Egyptians and the Persians still strewn upon the ground,
apart from one another as they had fallen. Thus, the
Egyptians must have long held their own, and been slain
in their ranks, rather than in their ﬂight.
