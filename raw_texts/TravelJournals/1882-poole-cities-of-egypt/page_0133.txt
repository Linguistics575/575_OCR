the south-eastern extension of Lake Menzeleh. Without
historical evidence, it would be impossible to say whether
these waters were once part of the Red Sea or of the
Mediterranean, or to which sea we should assign some
or all of them. All we could infer would be that at
some time there was a communication between the
lakes. But the evidence we want is at hand.

The Greek geographer Strabo, a very accurate writer,
tells us that the town of Heroonpolis was in the angle
of the Arabian Gulf or Gulf of Suez, which Pliny a
little later calls, after the town, the Heroopolite Gulf.
This place must have stood on the north-west of the
present Lake T imsah, not far from the town of Isma’eel-
eeyeh (Ismailia), the modern inland port of the Suez
Canal. Thus in Strabo’s time, about nineteen cen-
turies ago, the Gulf extended over forty miles north-
ward of its present head at Suez.

This view has been combated on account of the
discovery of the line of an old canal ._running from Suez
northwards for more than twelve miles. The date of
this canal cannot be ﬁxed. If it is of the time of the
Pharaohs, it must have been cut through the silt which

obstructed the sea between Suez and the Bitter Lakes.
