THERE‘S. 63

 

record the Egyptian belief as to the world to come, with
its trials, its rewards, and its punishments, all defaced by
the modern spoiler, though forty years ago some were
almost untouched. The royal. tombs are vacant, but the
last discovery at Thebes has brought some of their most
famous tenants to the upper air. On this side the valley
under the western cliﬁ', a great sepulchral hiding-place
was found, whither more than thirty mummies, mostly
regal, had been taken for safety in ancient times. Thus
Thothmes III., the great conqueror, and Ramses II.,
the great oppressor, are once more seen in the light of
day. If the Museum of Boolak has escaped the fanatical
and greedy mob of Cairo, we may there in the presence
of her ancient kings feel, as at Thebes, how Egypt
obliterates time and brings the present and past together
as by magic art.

Such is the briefest catalogue of the wonders of
Egyptian Thebes, that great and ancient city, which
of all the capitals of the world speaks most eloquently of
the times that are past, and echoes the thoughts of for-
gotten ages, telling the story of the vicissitudes of earthly
fortune as a warning, uttering the cry of human hope

and fear for the hereafter as an encouragement.
