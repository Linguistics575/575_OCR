stricken Cornelia, and Pompey’s comrades—all this
seems to rise before us in the bright sunshine of an
Egyptian September, for it befell on the twenty-ninth of
that month, the day before Pompey’s birthday, in the
year EC. 48. The dignity of Roman character, not yet
lost, elevates the event to the height of a tragedy, ﬁtly
closing with the brave ﬁdelity of the freedman and the
tenderness and respect of the rival leader.

The battleﬁeld of Pelusium, the entrenchments of .
N ectanabis, the tomb of Pompey, all have vanished,
and nothing now remains of the great stronghold but
mighty mounds with an outlying height of the same
kind near by, and a second farther away, rising from the
level of the dreary marsh, close to the seashore. It is
an awful desolation, wearying the eye with an unvaried
dark expanse, without a sign of life, and wearying' the
feet with the treacherous soil, in which they sink deeper
and deeper on the way to Pelusium. And the air seems
heavy with sad memories, as if they were native to the

place. '

' The latest and best description of Pelusium and the neigh-
bouring sites is in Mr. Greville Chester’s Report (Quarterly State-
ment of Palestine Exploration Fund, July 1880, p. :33, fall.)
