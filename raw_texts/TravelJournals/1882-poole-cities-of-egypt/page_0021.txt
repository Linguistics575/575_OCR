6 CITIES 0F EGYPT.

 

outline. This vast surface, formed of successive deposits,
shows how much of the gift of the Nile man suﬁ‘ers to be
yearly poured away into the sea and lost for ever. Were
a cutting made anywhere from the river into the desert,
the stream would carry Egypt with it in its course. No
sooner was the Freshwater Canal cut and the waters
of the Nile admitted, than the wilderness bloomed with
mysterious herbage.

The natural division into valley and plain, and the
character of Egypt, give us a clue to the names of the
country. In the older books of the Bible we ﬁnd
Mizraim a dual word, the two Mazors, like the two
Sicilies. In the Prophets Mazor sometimes occurs, and
even Mizraim for the Delta, while Pathros is their name
for Upper Egypt, the native Pa-ta-res, the Southland.
The derivation of Mazor is obscure, and conjecture is
mere learned idling; but it is interesting to know that
the old name survives in Misr, in the vulgar speech
Masr, the Arabic name of Egypt, and strangely also of
its capital. The old Egyptians do not leave us in doubt
as to their deﬁnition .of their country 5 with them it was
‘ Kem,’ the ‘Black,’ from the colour of its soil : there is

no place for the yellow desert in this descriptive name.
