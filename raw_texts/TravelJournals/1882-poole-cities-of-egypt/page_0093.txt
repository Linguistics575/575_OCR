78 CITIES 0F EGYPT.

 

Olympic meeting; yet they dwelt in tents, and rarely
wrote their complicated odes. Such were the ancient
dwellers in Lower Egypt. How many poets may have
sung before Moses we know not; but the Egyptians
heard the songs of their captivity, and learnt melodies
unknown before.

So there grew a bond between the two races. The
Egyptians, unlike their rulers, showed kindness to the
Hebrews, and were remembered kindly for this in after
times. The races mixed. The Hebrews bore Egyptian
names. When we ﬁnd a Moses (Messu), or a Phinehas
(Pi-nahsi), in the inscriptions, we need not think him an
Israelite. The Egyptians took Hebrew names, and if
Rui, the name of the high-priest of Thebes, is the same
as Levi, we need not infer that he isnot an Egyptian.

In all this Ramses saw a danger. The state was fast
becoming oriental. What if the old masters should win
again what they had lost? He could not stop the tide
of Egyptian thought, but he could separate and crush the
foreign element which had set it in action. Hence the
great persecution, during which the city Rameses, built
by serf-labour, rose to magniﬁcence Zoan had never

known.
