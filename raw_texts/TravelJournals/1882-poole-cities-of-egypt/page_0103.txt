Pharaoh of wasted opportunity and iJJ-spent wealth, to
set free the priceless records his tyranny holds in bond-
age. The French have worked here and elsewhere in
Egypt with well-rewarded vigour; why should not we
give them our aid, and brighten the last years of our
boasted nineteenth century with the glory of great dis-
coveries, so that when we have ended our labours, our
children may say, ‘ We can remember the excavations in
the ﬁeld of Zoan, and the land of Goshen ’?
