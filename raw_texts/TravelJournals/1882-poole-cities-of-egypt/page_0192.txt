SIN. 175

 

frontier—town, variously written Tahpanhes, Tehaphnehes,
Tahaphanes, which has been identiﬁed with Daphnae,
which Herodotus calls the Pelusiac Daphnae, sixteen
Roman miles south-westward of Pelusium. The Hebrew
name is evidently of Egyptian origin. It also occurs in
the form Tahpenes as that of a queen who was probably
consort of Shishak’s predecessor (I Kings xi. :9, 20).
She is the only Egyptian queen, and the ﬁrst Egyptian
royal personage, who is mentioned by name in the Bible.
The identity of the name of queen and town would not
be proof of Egyptian origin, for Semitic names were
then the rule in the foreign family of Shishak, and in
fashion with the natives. It is the uncertainty of the
orthography which shows that the source is not Hebrew.
The Greek name compared with it is clearly an adap-
tation, and until we know more from Egyptian sources we
cannot be sure that Daphnae was identical with the town
mentioned in the Bible. The evidence is, however, far
better than a mere likeness in sound. Clearly Tahpanhes
was a great military settlement (Jer. ii. 16), anda frontier-
fortress (Ezek. xxx. 18), where Pharaoh had a palace
(Jer. xliii. 9). The position on the border is farther

deﬁned if we assume that this was the point ﬁrst reached
