the end of the time of prosperity to the beginning of the
heaviest oppression, we have scarcely any hint of the
state of the Hebrews. Here again is a cogent reason for
exploration of sites in this district.

The Eighteenth Dynasty decayed and ended in the
confusion of a religious conﬂict. A new family, the
Nineteenth, the line of the kings nearly all of whom bore
the name of Ramses, the Ramessides, gained the throne,
and the second age of the Empire began ; another two
centuries of less extensive conquest but of more organised
rule abroad, and at home yet more fertile in memorials
of the time. It seems that these kings were akin to the
old rulers of Zoan, the Hyksos. Whether this be so or
.not, the eastern border now became a favourite part of
Egypt. New cities, both frontier strongholds and centres
of trade, arose everywhere. Zoan was rebuilt, and called
Pe-Ramses, ‘the house of Ramses,’ carefully distin-
guished in the inscriptions as Ramses 11., ﬁrst apparently
the name of a quarter, then that of the whole city. The
name thus marks the new founder as Ramses II., the
great oppressor of the Israelites, who ‘ built for Pharaoh
