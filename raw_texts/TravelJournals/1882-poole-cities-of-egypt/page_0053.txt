in gold and silver and bronze that the Phoenicians carried
to the islands of Greece, it gained the shapes we well
know, ﬁrst the slayer of the Lion and the Hydra, ending
at last in the boxer with his swollen ears, the coarse
ideal of a depraved age. The Egyptian god of strength
was portrayed with a ram’s head, by that strange union
in which animal worship and a higher idolatry met.
This divinity was a local form of Chnum the creator,
who is represented moulding the world as a potter on-
his wheel. His force is thus creative, not combative.
No remains of the temple at Heracleopolis are known :
doubtless they are hidden beneath the rubbish in the
centre of the mounds. Sacred buildings are always to
be sought in depressions, for while the houses of age
after age rose as the ruins of each period elevated the
mounds, the temples always retained their primitive
site, and all the additions and restorations stood on the
ﬁrst level of their sacred precincts.

It is not, however, for the curious details of the
tangled mythology of Egypt alone that search should be
made at Hanes. Temple and town, and the unknown
necropolis that must lie in the Libyan waste, should be

excavated for the materials of a lost book of history.
