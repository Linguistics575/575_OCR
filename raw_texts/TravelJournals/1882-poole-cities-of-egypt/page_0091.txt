76 CITIES 0F EGYPT.

(Exod. i. 11), the latter called elsewhere, as in the route
of the Exodus, Rameses. This was when the great heat
of the Oppression began.

How was it that a king, who seems to have had the
blood of the serf population in his veins, and who
specially favoured their part of Egypt, was at the same
time the great oppressor of the Hebrew section of the
people? The Shepherds had been long subdued; but,
by a subtle inﬂuence, they had conquered their conquerors
with the arms wherewith the Greeks led the Romans
captive. The age of the Ramessides is marked by a new
literary life. Hitherto the Egyptians had written much
on papyrus-paper and the pictured walls of the temples
and the tombs; they had written for the sake of religion
and duty, with patient method and studious care. Now
they write for writing’s sake, not alone in the old manner,
but on every material, on the very potsherds that still
strew the ruins of their ancient towns. The old literature,
like a mummy come to life again, bursts the bonds of
priestly rule, and sings new verse with native freedom.
An epic poem and beautiful hymns are of this age. Of
the same time are a multitude of letters, now in European

museums, mostly written in the very town of Rameses.
