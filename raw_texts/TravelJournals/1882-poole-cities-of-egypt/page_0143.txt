Two suppositions may explain‘ this. The gulf may
have turned eastwards beyond where we can now trace
it, and passed to the southward of Migdol, a view which
agrees with the statement that the sea was driven back
by the strong east wind, which implies a sea ﬂowing
from west to east as here supposed. In this case the
Israelites would have crossed from north to south. This
, question can never be settled without a survey. On the
other hand, the obvious strategy of Pharaoh would have
been to wheel the left wing of his chariot-force and throw
it across the road to Palestine which the Israelites had
left to the north, and this movement might have forced
them back along the west side of the gulf if it ran
northward, and they would have ultimately crossed from
west to east. In this case the east wind would have
'divided the sea, and not literally driven it back.

It is perhaps best to leave the majestic old narrative
without farther discussion. The sea has disappeared,
and curiosity cannot measure the depth. Like the
burial-place of Moses, the scene of the great deliverance
is unknown. It is enough that the conditions of the
country conﬁrm the historical truth of the narrative, while

they bafﬂe the inquiries of the critic.
