Page 129. From the expressions in the ‘ Dictionnaire Ge'o-
graphique,’ especially p. 919, one would be disposed to put
Dr. Brugsch’s modiﬁcation in a deﬁnite form; but since the pub-
lication in 1878 of the part of the work referred to, the second
English edition of the ‘ History of Egypt’ (188!) puts the case less
positively (ii. p. 42! seqq.). As the author well remarks, survey
and excavation are needed to settle the geography of the route of
the Exodus (p. 432).

Page 134. I am aware that Dr. Brugsch considers the sacred
name of On to be Pe-Tum, the Abode of Tum, and places Pe-Ra,
the Abode of Ra, to the northward. (‘ Dict. Géogr.’ under reﬁ'.
On, Heliopolis.) The difﬁculties of this view, which separates On
from Heliopolis, make me rather hold that the two names designate
two temples and quarters of Heliopolis.

Page 147. Dr. Brugsch, agreeing with the lamented Mariette,
maintains the primitive cultivation of the balsam-trees near Helio-
polis, on the strength of an early hieroglyphic inscription. (‘ Dict.
Géogr.’ p. 1279.) If so, there was probably a continuous cultivation
till the Arab times, and the relations of Herod with Cleopatra
would naturally have led to the employment of Hebrew gardeners
for their famous native trees.

Page 202. The important discovery. that St. Pachomius was
originally an Egyptian heathen recluse is due to M. Revillout
(‘Rev. Eg.’ i. p. 160). The ‘Revue Egyptologique ’ is full of
information of the highest value, derived from Coptic and Demotic
as well as Hieroglyphic sources.
