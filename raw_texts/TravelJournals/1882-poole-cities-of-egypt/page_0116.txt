GOSHEN. ror

 

history in the lively picture of the terrible Oppression
and the great deliverance. Not that all the events here
took place. The policy of Pharaoh was to scatter the
people. Yet Goshen always remained their central
home, and from it they went forth on the night of the
Passover.

Again history is silent till the chief town is once
more of note, when, as already said, it became the
capital of one of the petty kings who divided Egypt
among them in the days of the Ethiopian supremacy.
Later still, under the Greek sovereigns, the place was a
rich emporium of Asiatic trade.

Of the present site only this can be said, that, like
many famous towns of Egypt, it is marked, by extensive
mounds, and a scattered modern village, still preservmg
the Greek form of the name, Fakoos, a little altered
from Phaccusa. The country around is yet iertile,
though the dwindled Nileâ€”stream and neglected canals
do not enrich it as of old. Imagination only can picture

the prosperity that has passed away.
