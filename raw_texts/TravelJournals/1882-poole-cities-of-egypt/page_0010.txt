PREFACE.

*

THIS work, a reprint of articles on the Cities of Egypt
mentioned in the Bible, has been written with the object
of awaking such a popular interest in the famous sites
described as may lead to their farther exploration. The
Biblical notices of these cities, slight as they often are,
have been chosen for their liveliness and human interest

as the key-notes of each subject.

REGINALD STUART POOLE.
