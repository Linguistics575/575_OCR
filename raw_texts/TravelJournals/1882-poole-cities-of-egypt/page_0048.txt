HA NES. 33

Egypt and Assyria. It may be that we shall even
dig in earnest, could a little money but be spared from
the pressing claims of show, and luxury, and folly, for
labours which are certain of their reward, if we dare
but exchange a lottery which is all blanks for a lottery
which is all prizes. The cost of a pack of hounds
would in a few years clear all the monuments of Egypt.
Sennacherib was a mighty hunter, but he found time
for literary work, and organised research that the records
of former times should be preserved for the times to .
come.

Mariette, the great explorer of Egypt, whose loss we
still deplore, with small funds and in the teeth of endless
difﬁculties, by stern determination and the gallant spirit
of a Frenchman, achieved more than all who had gone
before him. He has fallen at last in the ﬁght, killed by
overwork and difﬁculties, but not by failure 3 failure he
refused to recognise. To him we owe the answer to
many a riddle of the mysterious Sphinx, all but the
Sphinx’s own riddle of origin and purpose. At his
bidding buried cities have thrown off the grave-clothes
which had enwrapped them for thousands of years, and
risen to tell us their story, and to ﬁll the ages of oblivion
