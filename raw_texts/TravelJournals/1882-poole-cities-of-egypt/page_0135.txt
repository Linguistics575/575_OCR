Mediterranean. This elevation, to cut the canal through
which was an arduous labour, is not throughout a marine
deposit. The lowest part of one section reveals a tough
bed at the base above the Suez level. The rest is
wholly of sand, and might easily have been accumulated
by drifts. Thus the obstacle is not serious, but it does
not seem to have covered a recent sea-bed. If we look
at any large map, we perceive that the ancient ex-
tension of Lake Timsah could have avoided this tract,
