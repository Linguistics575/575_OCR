the Library of Alexandria have outshone the fame of her
luxury and trade. When her name is mentioned, we
think not of a stately city, but of the long roll of patient
students who there led the schools of thought which we
call Alexandrian, of the hardy pioneers of science, and
of our large debt to those early labourers who toiled for
our proﬁt; and we remember that greatest ancient
treasure of books, the loss of which we ceaselessly de.
plore, for most of them are known to us only by name

or from a tantalising fragment.
