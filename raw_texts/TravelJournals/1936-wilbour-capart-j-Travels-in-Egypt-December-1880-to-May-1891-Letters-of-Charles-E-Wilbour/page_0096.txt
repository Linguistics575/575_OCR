CHAPTER II

Octaéer [881 to Apri/1882

MARSEILLES, THE SAID On board all right with goggles, Chester-

Thursday A. M. man’s steel-tape and a Chinese chair; and
(Postal Card) all wrong with a berth neither bag nor
Octoéer 20, 1881 trunk will go under, and a heavy easterly

breeze, I hope; but I fear more than that.
My ﬁfteen hour’s sitting left eyes and legs etc., stiff and sore, not
cured by the long sleep last night ...... The leave takings
have begun. Half the passengers seem to be children. There is a yel-
low paper in one of the two last letters of Professor Eisenlohr put into
my table drawer; will you send it to me at once; I want it for Emil

Brugsch at Cairo. Good—bye till Napoli.

TURNER’S BANK, NAPLES We went into a wind storm so severe
October 22, 1881 that everybody was driven from the
deck and during the night a wave top-
pled over the quarter deck through the skylights into the Saloon. I
was below where I did not even get my coat off. It revived the mem—
ory of that trip from Jersey. But I got straight yesterday afternoon
and this morning the sea was nearly calm. An Egypto-Frenchman
recognized me and his wife gave me some essence of mint which com-
pleted the cure yesterday; its bitter fragrance went to the spot. M.
Maspero’s mother and brother are on board, but I have not seen
them; indeed many passengers have not been seen.

Naples is as bright and beautiful and hot as ever. With a young
Englishman, one of my three roommates, I have been along the
Chiaja and am here at Ste. Lucia. This life and color is exhilarating
indeed. What a contrast to night before last. Then the winding of my
watches was an act of moral heroism which it took me half an hour to
screw my courage up to.
