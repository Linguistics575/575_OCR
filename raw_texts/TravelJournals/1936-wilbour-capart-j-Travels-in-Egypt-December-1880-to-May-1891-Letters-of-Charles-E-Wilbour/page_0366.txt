[CHAPTER FOUR

Saturday I must put in here an inscription I copied yester-

ﬂpri126, I884 day in Brindisi, which I thought worthy a place

with any Greek inscriptions. It was posted on the

walls. Can you imagine why a washerwoman should advertise that
she does not steal?

 

NON PIU FURTI
IN BIANCHERIA
CENTESIMI 50 IN PIAZZA

 

 

 

Dr. Koch told me about his work on the cholera germ in Egypt
and India, how not content with the ﬁfteen cases in which he found
it in Alexandria he went to India and found it in seventy more and
how when seventeen out of a population of a hundred about a pond
near Calcutta had died of cholera he found the germ in the pond
where they washed their clothes and took their drinking water and
into which some of their dejections ﬂowed. The cholera germ magni-
ﬁed seven hundred diameters he drew for me thus: ( the typhoid
germ is I ; a malignant sort of breakdown fever ; and in the
lungs of consumptives is found I . He develops Eithese germs
in a gelatine made nutritious by adding beef tea and pepton neutral-
ized. The cholera germ in this kept warm (79°Fahrenheit) after forty-
eight hours is to the naked eye: - A half-inch objective makes it

' and magniﬁed seven hundred diameters it is ( . Ordinary ﬁl-
' tering will not rid water of these germs but boiling does efﬁ-
ciently. While working among cholera he drinks only boiled

 

water.

There was a big Greek steamer the ELPIS, or the Hope, at
Brindisi; she had brought three Americans from the Isthmus of
Corinth who were with us and who found the trip from Athens de-
lightful, leaving Athens in the morning and crossing the Isthmus
about noon. The day was pleasant and we saw from time to time the
islands in the Adriatic.
