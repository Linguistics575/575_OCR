OCTOBER 1881 T0 APRIL 1882]

Wednesday Lovely clear weather; not too warm. I spent the
Jpn? 12, 1882 morning in the Museum which is a mess. Many
Arab women came. It seems that for them a visit to
it is a speciﬁc against sterility. Stories are told of wonderful cures
performed by it. . . . . . Rhoné is much better, but still in bed.
Maspero is making visits to ministers. His brother has come to live
on the boat. The four women are very busy making little clothes.
The Lady of the Form: who bought so many anteekeh at Luxor, has
sailed from Alexandria in her yacht without paying Cook’s bill for
dahabeeyeh towing. Cook added twenty-ﬁve pounds not in the con-
tract, for damages caused by dogs and monkeys . . . . . making
a total of two hundred forty pounds and ﬁve pence; whereupon Mme.
got her back up and said she wouldn’t pay it. However she has paid
them a good deal besides. Maspero dined with the Khedive who re-
ceived Brédifl successor of de Bligniéres with a grand banquet. Mme.
de Bligniéres is to go on the boat with me next week and so are the de
Rochemonteix and the two goats.

Thursday . . . . . I have been stowing away my photo-

ﬂpril 13, 1882 graphic things, am going to trade my big stones

with Maspero for bronzes so that I can pack them

snug in the two arks which I shall leave as before. The Mariette

boxes are opened and disclose a very simple sarcophagus of black
marble and very big with only this inscription:

 

MARIETTE
1821-1881

 

 

 

The idea of adding ”au successeur de Champollion,” was happily
given up. Arabi and the minister were to see the Museum, perhaps
to estimate how much it would sell for, while we were gone. Mme.

I. ”In the middle of 1882 M. de Blignieres was recalled to France, his place being taken by M. Brédif.
After the restoration of order, M. Brédif returned for a short time to Cairo. but did not resume his func-
tions." Sir Auckland Colvin. ”The Making of Modern Egypt." London. 1906. pp. 23—24.
