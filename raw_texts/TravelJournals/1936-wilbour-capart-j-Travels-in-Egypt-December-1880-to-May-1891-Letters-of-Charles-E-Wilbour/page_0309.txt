more new tombs, past Kuseeyeh, once sacred to Hathor and the cap—
ital of the fourteenth Nome, then past the Gebel Aboo Foda, which
we always watch from end to end, this time stopping twice to photo-
graph it from the boat and at night tying up at Manfaloot. This
morning I donkeyed' into and about the town sometimes alone and
sometimes with the caravan and after seeing some pretty mosques
we went to the Coptic church where the Bishop received us and in
his house gave us sherbet and coffee. He had some old Coptic litur-
gies on parchment which would be worth having. His black turban
was plaited and when a small shawl came down on either side, it was
a very complete Egyptian sphynx coiﬂ'ure.

I forgot to say that in Schmoomayn I for the ﬁrst time saw a

can make out the upper rock tomb of the luxurious Hap-Jefa. Think
of a man so big that he must have two tombs, in either of which you
might stow both of Compton's meeting houses and have room to let

We reach Siott. Ten steamers are lying here ready to take up
troops in case of need; they would be sent thus far by rail. But the
Mahdi will not come before the summer ﬂood. Some of our crew that
had been lent to Rostovitch, who directs the steamers, hail us; they
