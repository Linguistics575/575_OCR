[CHAPTEREIGHT

january 26, 1889 I bought of Aly a bit of Gazelle leather with

hieroglyphs, not of the Book of the Dead, of half
hieratic style thereon. At tea we had the Albrights, Mrs. 8: Miss
Mitchell interesting and pretty, the Murches; Appletons, daring
Miss Byron, Miss Austin and Miss Jervis. A Sleepy evening.

Sunday I began yesterday a new streamer, the Hathor to
7anuary 27, 1889 be inked blue on white cloth. Crete and his doc-
tor were in to-day and watched me with ﬁngers
as itching as those of Tom Sawyer’s white-washing friends. Lottie
and Dora on donkey and camel went to Karnak while I worked on
the hawk. Mrs. Appleton brought in Mme. Lefevre and her well
daughter. She has another and a son not well, so that though the
Cook dahabeeyeh she sent for, came up ten days ago, she has not
yet dared to take them away from Dr. Doat. They came over from
Marseilles with me, quiet folk. Theirs is a very old dahabeeyeh,
but she sails well, the Sultana. They are dragomaned by the meek
and humble Yoonas, who came up with the bedroom dahabeeyehs
last year. What they lack in boat and ﬁttings they make up in ser-
vants, three for the kitchen and three chambermen. Aly says they
are all bad, the cook very drunken.

LUXOR Todros’ Mohareb showed me new things, a good

Monday statue of Horhotep Neferhoo. Patre Francesco,

7anuary 28, 1889 Insingers and Crete called. Albright came to say

good-bye and sailed up. Hassan Speke talked

with me about a dahabeeyeh; I think he had better build than buy.

We had McLarens and Bousﬁelds to dinner. Oorooshwan and two
men went to Erment to make bread.

7anuary 29, 1889 Mohammed Mohassib brought me a good black
granite statue of a Mr. Victualler‘, and shortly
after noon we set sail with a light wind which took us only to north

of Taood.

1. “Mr. Victualler" is probably a translation of the name Zefau.
