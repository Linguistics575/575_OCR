[CHAPTERSEVEN

letter is sent to interpret it a targumaannu, a dragoman, in Arabic,
terguman. There are many letters from the Governors of Syria and
Phenicia, then under Egypt. One from Dunip (in Egyptian Tunep)
begs for speedy help against the advancing Kheta king. One tablet,
a mythological text, shows the hand of an Egyptian, who in his study
of it, has separated the words by points in Egyptian black and red
ink, as we see the phrases separated on many papyri. The importance
of this Ô¨Ånd can hardly be overestimated.

We mean to start to-morrow for Pavia to see the Certosa and next
day for Lake Como and soon to be in Paris again.
