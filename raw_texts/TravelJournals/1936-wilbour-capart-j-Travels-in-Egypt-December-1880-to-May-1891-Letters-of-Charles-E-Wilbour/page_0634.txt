[CHAPTER NINE

At Mrs. Johnson’s Lottie found oﬁicers, British, from Halfa who
said the Government was going to make Luxor a military post and
take the Karnak Hotel for ofﬁcers’ quarters; then their wives would
come and stay with them.

Marc/z I7, 1890 Old “Fifty-Seven” went up into the Sook in the

morning and afternoon to Mr. VVright’s and to
Pagnon’s store whence he took some edibles at Zigada’s prices to Cook,
sometimes a little higher than his prices to me. Little Miss Wright and
her mother came in toward night and Miss Johnson and her mother
dined with us and Seleeb showed us his anteekeh in the evening.
Johnson has bought land in the Fayoom and they have great hopes
from it. Lottie and the girls tea-ed with the Mission and blind old
Miss McKeown said that when the English went away they would
have to go. I think it more likely that the English will want their
buildings and take them, as already in Cairo where Scott-Moncrieff’s
Ministry occupies Ismael’s great Girl’s School, a splendid palace
with ﬁne grounds.

March 18, 1890 We came on with the Fostat, a pleasant seven of

shooting, whist-playing, British, who sent us quail,
and suspected smallpox on the Gamer/e]: which overtook us at night
near where we took steamer on our way up. I offered my services by
note to the Gameelelz’: ladies, who have no white man with them, and
had a reply that Miss Guthrie would call the ﬁrst night we were
moored together; it was too late then. Miss Brodrick, Egyptologist‘,
known to Sayce, is on board. The sick person was taken down to
Cairo by rail. Any eruption is called here smallpox.

March 19, 1890 Inspired by little Miss Wright I wrote to Mr.
Thayer at Trieste. We struggled with the wind to

Manfaloot.

March 20, 1890 We all visited the dead town in Gebel Aboo F eda,
where we found beautiful ferns fossiled in the

flaky limestone.
