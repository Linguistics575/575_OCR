[CHAPTEREIGHT

This is the ﬁrst year that I have copied nothing here, but it is
pleasant to see the great structure summarily. The Guardian seems
in much better health than last year, when I feared I might not see
him again. I sailed over to Mr. Berkeley’s boat and saw him and Dr.
Worthington, got roses in a garden and a thorn in my thumb.

F earuary 20, I889 \Ve visited the wall, grottoes, and nearer temples
of El Kab. In the approach to the Ptolemaic

Cave I saw some graﬂ'iti well done of Godﬁgures with Demotic names.

February 21, 1889 We went over in the high north wind to see the

little pyramid of Koolah, which Maspero spent
so long in not opening. It reminds me of Naville and Said and a
consumptive girl who came over from El Hegs that I might prescribe
for her.

F ebruary 22, 1889 At Esneh the Prince Abbas came with the Dikes,

the youngest waving her small ﬂag in response
to our eight. The girls came over at once and entertained us with the
pious squabble over the piano for the Sunday service; of course the
British had it, and they wanted it. I went with the Judge to the tele-
graph and the temple whither the girls had gone. Then we went on
with a note from Mme. Lefevre, gracefully grateful.

Fearuary 23, 1889 At Erment we had M. & Mme. Marchand to

lunch. He had news of the fall of the Floquetl
ministry ...... We tied up at nine o’clock at Luxor near the
Meermin.

Fearuary 24, 1889 Moved down, but are still above the Sultana,

which has our old place by the now green pond
and above Grébaut’s Sandal and steamer, here at last and an Eng-
lish dahabeeyeh. Daressy told me they had begun to move into the
Geezeh Palace.2

1. Charles Floquet. French politician (1828-1896).
2. From Boulaq Museum to the Geezeh Museum.
