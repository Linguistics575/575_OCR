NOVEMBER 1889 TO MARCH 1890]

[Marc/2 21, 1890 We rowed and then sailed on to the sand and then

rowed again to Haggi Kandeel where I got no news
of the Heretic King’s Tomb which, Sayce feels sure, has been found.
The Omdeh, who according to Khaled, shared with Khaleel the tomb
cutter, denied all knowledge of it as stoutly as did Abd-er-Rasool
afore time. There was nothing worth buying but a mirror-handle
and a small hoe or adze, both in bronze.

March 22, 1890 We came early to Antinoé whither the rest went

while I was to Rodah for letters, a cheerful one
from Victor about his two-weeks’ tooth-ache and none from Comp-
ton. In the afternoon Lottie and I posed, as on donkeys, for Ned in
the Saloon, thermometer 88°.

March 23, 1890 We came early to Minieh. The crazy tailor who has

a window full of anteekeh and hundreds of coins,
seemed afraid we should steal them; another Greek asked about ten
times Luxor prices. Here as at Rodah they tell me the fellaheen were
never so poor; all sigh for the days of the dual control. Then we got
on the sand and broke the mast of the felucca and Pilot Seeum is sure
that somebody from on shore has cast the Evil Eye on our boat, it is
so ﬁne.

March 24, 1890 A mile south of Surareeyeh we went to the Speos of

Meneptah‘,where the surroundings were so ﬁne that
Ned made a sketch and we sent back for the rest. The rock has been
quarried away so as to leave something like an Arch of Triumph. The
Speos was all copied by Lepsius but I found outside an inscription of
an Arch prophet of Amon, Mohee, hitherto unknown.

March 25, 1890 We made not more than a mile and it was so windy

I did not go ﬁve miles west to El Qeiss’, the old
capital of the Seventeenth Nome, known to the Greeks as Dogtown.
I have not heard that anything ancient is to be seen.
