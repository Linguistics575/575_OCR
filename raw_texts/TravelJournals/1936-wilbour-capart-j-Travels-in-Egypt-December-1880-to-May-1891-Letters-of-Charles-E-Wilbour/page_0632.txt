[CHAPTER NINE

March 9, I890 The wind kept us still all day. In the evening

Raphael came over with the Greek head and it is
in the corner of the Saloon now. Also a much more ancient toma-
hawk, bronze with a new handle of old wood.

March 10, 1890 With less wind we came on, stopping for a walk

after noon, Britisher Bath complained much of the
heat, never knew it so hot in Egypt as this year; I never knew it so
cold. He is up in Ahmed Pacha’s big dahabeeyeh and keeps along
with us. We tie up at Ket Katee, too late to go to the Quarry far up
the mountain.

March 11, I890 The south wind favored us so that we might have

seen the sunset at Sioot, but alas, at Nekheeleh,
seventeen miles short, we went on a shoal and staid till ten o’clock at
night. The last three hours our men were helped by a Captain I
know, and men from the Eva, which Hassan Speke had last year. Our
pilot is not doing as well as last year.

March 12, 1890 The high wind made it very dusty in the gardens

of Nekheeleh, I saw to the west a stretch of wheat
three or four miles to the mountain, unbroken except by the brown-
green villages and the stakes set for the railroad which is to be built

up to Geergeh.

March 13, I890 Abooteegl, picturesque with its twin-towered
mosque, we all explored. Southeast of the town and
near the river lies a piece of sculptured granite, half-fashioned into a
huge millstone, which I think is a slice from the fallen obelisk of the
Queen Pharaoh2 at Karnak. I took a copy and careful measurements
to compare it with the one still standing. Near it is a section of a
granite pillar six by one-third feet through, which I cannot refer to its
temple. Yesterday I went to the garden of Seleen for oranges, which
being rather small we were given a hundred ﬁfty for the hundred.
