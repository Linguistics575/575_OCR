Noveméer [886’ 2‘0 ju/y [889

STR. Natal I left Lottie and Dora at the sidewalk and Victor
MARSEILLES at the station once more and a Java Dutchman
Noveméer 4, 1888 and I had a compartment which enabled us to lie
at full length in comfort from eight last night till

eight this morning, when we had some talk. He knows British rule in
the East and feels it as detestable as I. Here I ﬁnd a note from In-
singer saying my rudder will be ﬁnished by this time; I get a beef-
steak and a chair, drive to the Prefecture to thank M. Blanc, Mr.
Frénay’s cousin, for getting my ticket, and write a note for him,
being out, and then come on board. The steamer’s men take my
things and the three thank me for ten cents each; the steward paciﬁes
a coachman with six francs and ﬁfty centimes for two and a half
hours, he demanding eight, baggage included, and I ﬁnd myself in a
ﬁne airy cabin, on a boat about four hundred twenty feet by forty-
two, and on the deck corresponding to the Conversation-room deck
on the Atlantic liners. These staterooms are not continuous on the
sides of the dining tables; there are two intervals on either side, each
with two portholes two feet square; in these intervals are settees and
card tables at one of which I write. I think if Lottie and Dora can
manage to come by such a boat they will be more comfortable than
last time; I expect to be. At the Oﬂice in the Cannebiére they told me
that my room-mate was Sec. of Legation Bapst. The rooms are
about eight feet by nine, and have two of these large portholes. Baron
Menascé,l who called on us at Luxor, accosted me last night and this
morning and again at breakfast at the Grand Hotel de Marseille. He
will be on the boat. The Temp: yesterday had it “rough” at Mar-
seilles, but it has been calm and is and must be smoother now. This
