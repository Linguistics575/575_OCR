NOVEMBER 1887 TO MAY 1888]

Nefady and Oorooshwan are counting much on the arrival of the
“Sittat”. Yesterday they put the Sittat’sl saddles in order and I showed
Nefady how to attach my felucca behind the other so that I may
myself lower the stern stairway and pull up our boat in a half a min-
ute. But, alas! another has done it today and I must send Nefady
to right it. It is the old story of the saddle girths.

They are counting on having a new streamer when the“Sittat” come.
I have the white and red for it, but you must bring the blue from
Cairo, even if you use a cook’s apron as you did last year. I need also
two rolls of cord, clothes line size, such as you will ﬁnd at the hard-
ware shop where we bought the stove; each roll I think has sixty
metres.

Aboo Shanab says it is a shame that there is no name about the
boat. 80 I have drawn on one of the two life buoys I got in Alexan—
dria, something like this:

 

If the circle is not good, draw a better one. On the other I think I
will paint, also in blue, for I abhor black. SEVEN is too much. Some
day I may brace up, as Victor says, and come back around the lower
halfwith Arabic, which would not look bad. I will add it to the last in
pencil and take your advice, 0 Children of the West.

The ﬂy specks on the windows here resist alcohol and turpentine
and succumb only to brawn and steel; they are like their authors in
persistence. And the painter sprinkled the windows very carefully
with minute spatters of red and white and blue and green, which vie
with the ﬂy remains for endurance. But then this is the land where all
things endure and old age is one hundred and ten years.

 

I. Sittat = the ladies.
