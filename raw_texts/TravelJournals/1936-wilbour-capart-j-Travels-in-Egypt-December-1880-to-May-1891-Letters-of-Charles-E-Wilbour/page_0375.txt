CHAPTER V
Noveméer [885 to May-I886

COLOGNE The wagon-lits are execrable, the worst shaking
Sunday I have had since Alabama twelve years ago. But
8 A. M. I have not caught cold and it is clear ﬁne

November 29, I885 weather this morning, good for the big over-
coat ......

LEIPZIG I have sent you only two postals yet of my haps
December 8, 1885 and mishaps and it is time that I scolded about
the sleeping car which brought me away from you
nine nights ago. It was the worst I ever endured, worse than a terri-
ble night I remember coming up from New Orleans through Alabama
in 1872. They did not smoke in that old Pullman and it had some
springs. Our promiscuity was such that I could not take my clothes
of? and I was glad enough at Cologne to get a little breakfast and into
a comfortable second class German compartment with all necessary
accommodations. So too was a young Scotchman who was coming
over to Leipzig and to Plauen to get something made for sale in man-
ufacturing England. He slept most of the way to Hanover, much to
the satisfaction of a blonde man and maid who shared the compart-
ment with us. I did not sleep half as well. In a waking interval the
Scotchman told me how fearful his Wife was on their trip that she
should be recognized as a bride. They read their Kb'lnise/ze Zeitung
together but only one spot had any interest for them; ﬁnally the
blonde man cut that out. I noticed where the hole was and in my pa-
per it was this:

Ferd. Mertznich, Maria Mertznich, geb. Krebs, Vermahlte Koln,
28, November, 1885. The Scotchman and I needed no such an-
nouncement, even when they ate a sausage together.
