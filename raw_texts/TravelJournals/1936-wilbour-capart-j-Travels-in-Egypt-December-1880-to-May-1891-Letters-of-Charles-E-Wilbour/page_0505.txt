NOVEMBER 1887 TO MAY 1888]

to see our boat. The little woman speaks English not badly and
seems able to furnish judgment for the overgrown boy. She is said to

be able to help him copy hieroglyphics.

Tuesday No wind to speak of and Aboo Shanab’s rudder

December 20, 1887 not done, perhaps two hours’ work of an average

blacksmith. But his legs are bad and he can’t go

to the town and boss it. I had to direct every blow on my wedges. I

wanted this, and the smith insisted on making that, but I had my
way with much expense of voice and gesture.

BENI SOOEF, 2 P. M. Will you get ﬁve or ten metres of tracing
GLASSY, BUT PROMISING cloth, at the bookstore across the way or
NORTH WIND at Penasson’s near the Crédit Lyonnais.
Deceméer 20, 1887 I want it to seal up windows when it is too
cold; it will let the light in. Had Piehl and
wife to dinner with Aboo Shanab. The wife has improved Piehl
greatly, though she be only half as high as he. His little boat went on
by the rope to-day; we shall overtake him with wind. I have wedged
up the rudder so that Abdoo thinks it will do. We hope soon to make
Magaga, thirty-three miles and hear from you what day you will be
ready to come. Existence is a luxury, and we shall need nothing but
the Sun and the glassy water to be happy.

Wednesday Still the rudder unﬁnished. But as the wind

Deceméer 21, 1887 came up a little at two we thought it better I

should go on after sending a telegram to ask

what day Lottie and Dora, who ought to be at Shepheard’s, would

come. I have been writing to them at Alexandria and at Cairo, but

telling them to answer at Magaga thirty-three miles further on. I
suppose answers are there, but I am not. '

7 P. M. I sent the telegram asking them to send answer to Bib-

beh. At six I reached Bibbeh and sent the Rais to the
telegraph ofﬁce. He is loaﬁng about something. If there were wind
enough to move I would start and let him walk three or four hours;
