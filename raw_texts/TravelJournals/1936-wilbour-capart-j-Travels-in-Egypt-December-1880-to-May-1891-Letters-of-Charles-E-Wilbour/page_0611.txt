Bakharess.

La Fite’s work near Farshoot. He is building a
Syphon, that is an acqueduct carrying one Canal over another, and
for that purpose has Decauville Railway and electric light, this

Countess, gave me coﬂ'ee.

eral Schuyler coming down. He stopped and
dined with us. He is enthusiastic about his voyage. At night in
Dishneh, Tanyos’ nephew Mady, came to see us. His twelve year old
sister, married last week, could not. Mr. Blashﬁeld sketched them
three years ago. Mady studies to be a Scribe.

Grandma’s letter, and the Watsons in a Cook

boat, which had passed us, steaming slowly. It is ﬁtted ﬁnely and has
electric light. Nearly all its passengers were Americans.
