Noveméer 1889 to Marc/1 I890

SHEPHEARD’S, CAIRO Left Paris anxious, Lottie but little better
Noveméer 20, 1889 from a very bad cold which gripped her lungs.
Victor at the station was sad. Came with
three cigarette smokers to Marseilles at noon, November 21. Sought
the St. Gobain dépot of plate glass in the sunshine and picked out
eight panes dahabeeyeh window size twenty-three by thirty-nine and
a half inches, for thirty dollars insured to Cairo station. At Tarascon
this morning changed from a Spain car to a Marseilles and had a
pleasant talk with the widow of General Pittie, master of ceremonies
to President Grévy. She had been spending a month with Mme.
Carnot1 and was going to her mother’s at Toulon, much interested in
politics. Ambrose P. Ralli was at the Grand Hotel of Marseilles; we
sat opposite him and his wife coming from New York.

November 22, 1889 Got my plate glass and the things sent in ad-

vance and myself on board and we sailed at four
on a level sea which continued till Alexandria the twenty-seventh.
Young M. Lefevre was on board; his mother and sisters, one of whom
is to be married, came to see him off. I sat at table with him and a
very intelligent Russian, Mr. Snazeen, who told us much about Rus-
sia and the effects of Emancipation there. Dr. Milton was on board
with his bride, the Miss Monroe who came out with Miss Hughes in
1888, had typhoid and was sent back. I was shocked to hear that
Miss Hughes died of typhoid in August. She was an able, gracious
woman and very kind to us last spring. At Alexandria I sat two hours
beside Mr. Towrest, the chief Inspector, while the red tape of the
Custom House which enveloped my sail was picked out all owing to

 

I. The wife of Sadi Carnot, the French President of the Republic.
