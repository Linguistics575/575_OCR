TRAVELS IN EGYPT
CHAPTER I

December 1880 to April I 881

IVIARSEILLE The boat starts in an hour and I hope to with
Deceméer 16, 1880 it. . .
Grand Hotel Look among Eisenlohr’sl letters I emptied with

papers in the cylinder box for a tracing of map,
and send it to me at Luxor.

All right and comfortable.

NAPLES I send you the notes which I have made thus far.

December 18, 1880 Will you send them or a copy of them to Comp-

ton; I am sure Zoe will be glad to copy them if

Dora does not want to. If you send the original, keep a copy which

please make in a book; I may want to refer to them. The trip thus far
is wonderfully comfortable.

On the cover of the Catalogue of the Book Sale is an address of an
old book man; I remember only“ Le Logeres, rue de la Senne.” The
number may be “18” and the street may be “Seine.” But the man
has a quantity of odd maps of the Atlas of the Description d’Egypte,”
the great book at one volume of which you looked, up at the book
auction place. He asks ﬁfty centimes a piece for single ones; offer him
twenty-ﬁve for the lot if there are not more than forty; if there is more,
then ten francs for the lot. . . . . . Am going to breakfast and
ashore.

I. August Eisenlohr. German Egyptologist (1832—1902). Honorary Professor at the University of Heidel-
berg, where Charles E. Wilbour had been one of his students.
