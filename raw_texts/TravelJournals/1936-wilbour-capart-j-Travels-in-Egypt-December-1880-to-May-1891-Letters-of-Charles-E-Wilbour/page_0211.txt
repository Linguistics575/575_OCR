CHAPTER III
Deceméer [882 to April [883

LYON’s STATION We waited after being shut up in the cars, for
8 P. M. more than two hOurs within a mile of the Paris
December 13, I882 station. Probably there was an accident, but we
have not yet heard of it. After F ontainebleau the
sun broke out but of late it has been raining. The breakfast at Ton-
nerre, which came at two instead of twelve, found a good appetite,
although I had been poisoned by the efHuvia of a huge English
woman, who was very sick crossing the channel last night. A young
man, who might have been her son, gave her medicine from time to
time. They and the two French women who had half a bushel of eat-
ables wrapped in papers and gathered into a net bag, have just got
out and to accommodate a party of women and children who want
my compartment, I am put into a coupé alone. I have seen the moon
over my left shoulder this thirteenth day of the month, a bad be-
ginning.
MARSEILLES Arrived at last. Had a pleasant hour’s talk with
2 A. M., 141}; a young moustache who has just ﬁnished his
volontariat in the artillery, and in ten months
will pass an examination which will make him an oﬂicer in the reserve
thereof. He was very well informed in politics and I liked his ideas on
the army and international aﬂ'airs. I have read a hundred pages in
Lane’s One Thousand and One Night: and as many in the XIXt/z
Century which MacKaye sent me, and with a pint of milk end the
day.
10 A. M. Had good sleep and have taken a turn in the
town and bought a bamboo chair, with broad
arms. It is overcoat weather no more. Looked over the passenger list;
know nobody. Mr. Greenough and family and Miss Gibbons come on
at Naples; is it the artist?
