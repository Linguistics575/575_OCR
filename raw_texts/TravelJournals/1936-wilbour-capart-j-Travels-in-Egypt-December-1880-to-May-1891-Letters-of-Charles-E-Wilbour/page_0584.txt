from the bottom of the coil to the mouth might have given passage to
water, or as Grébaut suggests, to oracles. The head inferior 1n art, is

glued on.

1144”}: 6, 1889 Judge Kinsman left us and went to the hotel for a

few days, and after taking on half a steer from In-
singer, a hundred eighteen pounds for three dollars and eighty-two
cents, we set out, with a wind so strong that it threatened to push us
upon the Luxor stones. Soon it hauled a little and we could sail and
then it hauled again and we could only tie up and endure the dust-
storm. My thumb has been busy since Edfoo, spite of much consump-
tion of carbol glycerine and painting with iodine. However the
iodine has got the better of the inferior ring and I hope for better
things.

March 7, 1889 We were able to sail through the Qamoola bend

and then to tie up again.

March 8, 1889 Little progress, but after noon we donkeyed in an

hour to Shenhoorl, where there is a small, poor tem-
ple, the Sanctuary of the time of Augustus, the outer wall of Tibe-
rius. It belongs especially to “Isis on her way from Thebes,” and
much respect is paid to Amon-ra of Thebes, Horus the Elder of Qoos,
and Min of Coptos. Only the sanctuary, one side room and the out-
side of the outer wall are inscribed and next time I must carry a
hatchet for the tamarisk bushes and a ladder and have a whole day
or two.

March 9, 1889 Heavy head wind so that we did not reach Negadeh.

March 10, I889 Ditto wind. Oorooshwan walked on to Keneh and

we came in sight of it. I have been reading Dr.
Richardson’s Voyage with the Earl of Belmore", whom he nearly
always speaks of as “the noble traveller,” and Paul Lucas’ Voyage3
