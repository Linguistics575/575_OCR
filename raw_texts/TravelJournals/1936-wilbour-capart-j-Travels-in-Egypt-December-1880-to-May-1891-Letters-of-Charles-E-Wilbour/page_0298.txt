CHAPTER IV
Feb-um}! 1884 to May [884

HOTEL DE VE’SUVE Yesterday came the answer to my telegram in-

NAPLES quiry and it is not a pleasant one to start on.

February I, 1884 Had I not promised to go I would rather wait

to hear that “Mama is well” than to go with

“Mama is better.” Of what? And why in all these days have I had no
word.

In Rome I saw for half an hour in my vettura good old Vassilli;
he was that day moving upstairs for dryness and the customs oﬂicer
had come to examine his boxes from Cairo. How different from ours!
He talked very despondently about Egypt and thought the English
would try soon to drive out Maspero, whose genial sympathy con-
trasted so with the coarse vulgarity of Mariette. He loaded me with
messages for all his friends and his faithful Aly, who will be on the
boat with us. I hope some day he will be in Paris and able to mount
our stairs. We will give him some good wine and hear strange stories

of his campaigns with Garibaldi and his thirty years in Egypt.

I drove to see Haruisch who is just out the Pom: del Papa/o at
the Villa Strohlfern, where he found a studio high enough to house
his Calhoun.1 The statue, ﬁfteen feet high, will I think be counted
good, though Calhoun’s lank face and form cannot be made artistic.
He has just risen from his chair and seems ready to speak. About the
pedestal, thirty feet high, are to be four allegorical ﬁgures, which will
give scope for art. Haruisch seemed very grateful to me for having
come so far to see him and begged to be remembered to you all. He
would be very glad if he might do something for Mr. Blashﬁeld.

I called on Schiaparelli’s Egyptological friend Baron Barracco2 at
160 Corso and was astounded at the wonderful collection of Greek

1. John Caldwell Calhoun. American statesman and parliamentarian (1782-1850).
2. Giovanni Barracco (1829-191 .1) founder of the Museo Barracco in Roma. See “Catalogo del Musco di
sculptural antica." Fondazione Barracco. Roma. 1910.
