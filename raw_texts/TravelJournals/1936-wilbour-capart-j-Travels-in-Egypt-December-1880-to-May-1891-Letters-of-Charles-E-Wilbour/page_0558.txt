[CHAPTERBIGHT

December 29, I888 Went to Luxor and telegraphed to Seleeb at

Sioot, who answered that they left by Cook’s
steamer this morning all right. I sat in the draught reading the papers
in the hotel and caught a stitch in my back. Breakfasted with Bou-
riant and saw Mohammed Mohassib’s things, not much. On the way
back I bought of Aboo Gamb a wooden representation of a seal,
eight inches across, the ﬁrst I have seen, an inkstand and some stone
shot.

Deeeméer 30, 1888 Sciatica bad so that I did not go out. I worked
up my forty days’ observations from Novem-
ber twenty-ﬁrst till to-day with the psychrometer and sent them to
the Lancet. They show a mean temperature for each of the eight ﬁve-
day periods of 66°, 65°, 65°, 63°, 60°, 60°, 63°, and 69°, not very
uneven. The mean temperature at seven A. M. is 56°, at noon 62°,
at three P. M. 71°, at seven P. M. 68°, at midnight 65°. The highest
temperature I found during the forty days was 79°, the lowest 47°.
As to dryness, I have only the French observations to compare with
and the general result is that our, boat is two thirds as much drier
than Nice, as in Biskra, a place on the edge of the Sahara in Algiers
which is counted to be the driest place to which an invalid can go.

December 31, 1888 They came, the Cook boat stopping at the daha-

beeyeh, we took them off with much satisfac-
tion. The railway ride was not so very bad after all and they had
found pleasant people on the boat.

yanuary I, 1889 We had visits from Aly Moorad and Insinger and

wife yesterday and to-day from Aly Moorad and
Diab and from Mohassib, Bouriant, Crete and Insinger. Last even-
ing and to-day we sent off near a hundred New Year’s cards; they
had sent from Cairo more than a hundred.

‘j‘anuary 2, 1889 Walked up to Diab’s house with some help over
hard places by Showoolly. Diab’s fat brother told
me their father Timsaah was Champollion’s reis and got his French
