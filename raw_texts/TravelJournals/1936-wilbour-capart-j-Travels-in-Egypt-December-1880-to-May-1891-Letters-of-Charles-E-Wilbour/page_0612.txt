[CHAPTER NINE

yanuary 20, 1890 The mail brought a letter from Victor.

LUXOR Mr. Brunner, who has been kept here, luckily
yanuary 21, 1890 for us, by the illness of his friend Ellis, brought
over Mr. Gimingham, head of the Edison-Swan
electric lamp factory in London to see the old glass. We call it
Roman but there is no reason to suppose that it is not Pharaonic,
for in the British Museum there is a glass cup with the cartouche of
Thothmes 1111, and glass-blowing is represented in the Beni Hassan
tombs of the Twelfth Dynasty, a thousand years earlier.2

Last evening the Cook boat came up and Mr. 8: Mrs. Somerville,
who live in Paris called on us. They are enjoying their trip greatly
and coming from Jerusalem’s snows do not complain of the cold.

yanuary 22, 1890 Ned’s bad headache prevented him and Linnie

from going with Mr. Brunner, Dora and I to
Medinet Haboo where we found M. Bouriant at work, and much ex-
tent of temples wall uncovered since we last saw it. Prince Czar-
torisky3, who has a museum in Cracow, was there, a genial old man,
much interested. We went into two new tombs, one in Sheikh Abd el
Qoornah, of a Mr. Fairbrother‘, whose upper, open tomb I had ex-
amined and mapped years ago. This lower one, sealed up, contained
the family mummies and funeral furniture. The other was that of
Mr. Strong and his wife Twinlandss, opened by Grébaut and closed
by a door. Visitors have already begun to deface it. The rest came
back to tea and I visited the son of Qamoory and Aboo Gamb. I saw
many things but bought only a demotic ostracon, a delicate bronze
saw and a curious pin.

II. p. 142; P. E. Newberry, “A Glass Chalice of Tuthmosis III,” in “Journal of Egyptian Archaeology,"
vol. VI. 1920, pp. 155—160 and p1. XVI. There is no doubt that the name of Men-Kheper-Re on those
two vases is not of Thutmes III of the XVIIIth dynasty but of Men-Kheper-re, son of Pinedjem of the
XXIst.

Hasan see F. \V. Bissing. “Glasbléser oder Metallarbeiter." “Recueil de Travaux.” vol. XXVIII. 1900.
