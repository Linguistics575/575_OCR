[CHAPTER THREE

Friday I Stimso’ned a little this doubly unlucky day and
April 13, 1883

Saturday went back to Bedreshayn, where Maspero is at

ﬂpril 14, 1883 work on the Pyramid of Sokar-em-saf.l It was hot

at night and I went to sleep with door and window

open and next morning my eyes were worse and Maspero advised
me to get on the sea. So

Sunday I packed and came with Charmes to Cairo. They all

dpri115, 1883 came to see us off from steamer to station. I was

sorry to leave Mme. Maspero in Egypt; she is sen-

sibly weaker in muscle and especially in nerves than she was last
year.

Monday Stimson thought he would go to Alexandria with me
A'pri/ 16, 1883 that I might tell him about a collection offered for
the exhibition and we are to see it tomorrow. He ate
most of the way and I had a good dinner half way. We found on
arrival that the French boat sails tomorrow and not Wednesday as
we thought. F arman who had gone to bed got up to see me, thinks he
will leave after four or ﬁve months and “pick up a wife.” I told him
about the Pomeroy girls incidentally; it struck him.

Tuesday Stimson saw me on board and I wrote “no more

Apri117, 1883 that day” nor until

Saturday when we are just approaching Capri and are called
April 21, 1883 for breakfast.

Naples is beautiful forever but the Said will roll
when in the harbor. I have hardly had an opportunity to investigate
my fellow-sufferers. One of them the pretty Scotch lassie who ﬁgured
so picturesquely on the voyage last year as La Baronne de M. . . .,
has not been having so good a time this year, for Baron B ..... comes
with her. And he is half-crippled on one side and has a strawberry
mark wrapped round his face leaving only a diagonal streak of white

I. Sokar-cm-saf read Mehti-em-aaf.
