[CHAPTER TWO

Thursday We are on our way back to Luxor ......

February 16, 1882 The great feature of this year on the Nile is the

fewness of dahabeeyehs. Last year saw but half

as many as the year before; this year not half as many as last. And
yet the renters are building more.

On our arrival Consul General Wolf with some of his party called
to make sure that we dine with them in the evening. Maspero,
Brugsch and I went. We had a pleasant evening. The editor of the
Frankfurt 70urnal, a very anti-Bismark paper, interested Maspero
most. Mr. Peixotto as well as Mr. Wolf told me of the pleasant visit
they had with you. Wolf wants me to arrange to come to Paris when
he does via Naples and Italy.

Friday Brugsch convoyed the Consul and his party to
February 17, 1882 the West Side and goes down with them to-
night in the Postal Steamer to show them Den-
dera. They invited me to dine again but as I went to Karnak in a
dahabeeyeh and did not return until seven-thirty, I did not receive
the invitation in time. There was a high wind yesterday and some
to-day. But it was calm in the temple. These mighty stones seem
superior to the elements.

LUXOR I have yours of the ﬁfth and tenth and two pa-
February 20, 1882 pers. How far away seem the little squabbles and
envies and impertinences of the colony. If they
would only study Chinese what an improvement it would be. But I
never heard of taking a lady in to supper in order to be disagreeable
to her. Dr. Warren had rather a hard dose when Mrs. Hueston asked
him to take in Mrs. Heermann, but he did it and after a few mouth-
fuls had a professional engagement.

Saturday February 18th, I went to Karnak.
Sunday February 19th, I went to Karnak.

Monday February 20th, I have been to Karnak. So you see I
have not much to write. But Sunday I took tea with Mrs. Moulton
and a half dozen of her friends. . . . . And to-day I breakfasted
with the ship—wrecked crew of the Sultana, Mr. Birkbeck, wife and
