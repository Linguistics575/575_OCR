OCTOBER 1881 T0 APRIL 1882]

BEDRESHAYN I returned a call from the dahabeeyeh an00 at ﬁve
Sunday o’clock and stayed to dinner. Dr. Biddle had gone to
April 2, 1882 Cairo, but Andrew Blair and wife and lawyer
Dwight Collier and wife and mother were expecting
to go to Sakkarah Monday and to ﬁnish their voyage in the after—
noon, making a hundred nineteen days' journey to Wady Halfa and
back, of which sixteen will have been spent in sight-seeing. The wives
had sketch-books, Mrs. Collier’s rather good. We had much to talk
over about the voyage and what they had seen and what it meant.

they should much regret the change from their home life and home
table to a hotel and being strung along in a row. The Blairs go to
Syria and the Colliers to Italy. They were in some trepidation lest the
Pattersons should get to Cairo ﬁrst, and extolled the Nefert for mak—
ing the trip three weeks quicker than their old tub. But they have
shot three crocodiles.

have nearly all sunk somewhat and it would seem dangerous to work

under them, half fallen as they are, had they not probably been in
about the same threatening position a thousand years ago. But they
are enormously thick and where they have sunk two feet still hold by
six or seven. This is the way they form the chamber. Aforetime there
were side walls where I have made dotted lines but the sinking of the
huge stones has crushed them and the rooms are half ﬁlled with their
