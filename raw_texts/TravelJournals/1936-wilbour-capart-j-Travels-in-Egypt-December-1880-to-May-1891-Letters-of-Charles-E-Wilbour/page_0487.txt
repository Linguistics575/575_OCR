C HAPT E R VII
November 1887 to May [888

CAIRO Tuesday afternoon the Professor Toy perceived
SHEPHEARD’S symptoms of the dengue, pains in the head,
Friday back and thighs, but a pot of tea on going to bed

Noveméer 11, 1887 cured him. I went with him to Pompey’s Pil-

lar. There are letters of a Greek inscription on a
piece of black granite in the pedestal, which I had not before noticed.
Wednesday morning we came over here and saw rather more water
on the way than ever before, also more lillies. After lunch Aly and N i-
fady were at the steps. They seemed very glad to see me. Nefady said
they three had come down a week before and Abderrahman had
found something to do for a few days. Aly went with me to the boat.
The things are locked up in the house and Aboo Shanab showed me
the new Reis, Mohammed Beshnik, and the few new timbers and
the many new planks. When ﬁnished, they say the hull will be good
for ten years. When I came back I found the things I had sent on by
freight had come. The Bawwab at Hotel Abbatt did it and saved me
thirty francs.

Thursday I took the Professor about to ﬁnd his dwelling-place then
to Mr. Cardwell’s, now moved down South, a block beyond Arabi’s.
Cardwell and one daughter have had fever. He has reports of a ﬁght
between the Italian Consul at Luxor and our Consul, ..... At
his suggestion we went to Mme. Finck’s, where the Professor took
board, an enormous room, many Eastern carpets and fourteen
pounds a mon th. I think Consul General Wolf had the same. Wednes-
day evening I saw the young Luxor doctor who told me about Mus-
tafa’s death and how the ﬂoods had carried away the Mustafa house
in the ﬁelds. He had just come with John Cook from Wadi Halfa,
thought Upper Egypt was the only healthy part of the country, they

were now living of’r~ in the river to avoid the dengue.
