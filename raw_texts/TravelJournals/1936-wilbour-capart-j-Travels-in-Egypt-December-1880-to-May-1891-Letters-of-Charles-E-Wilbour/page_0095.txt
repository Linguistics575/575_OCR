DECEMBER 1880 TO APRIL I881]

ﬁlled and were going on to Wadi Halfah. And the Syenite Postmaster
who recognized me, and told me the news, said they had stayed there
for two weeks. They must like to be warm, this Princess and the
Count R ..... We didn’t ﬁnd anything better in the bazaars than be-
fore and Saturday morning De Rochemonteix and I rode a camel and
the rest donkeys, to the railway station, near the steamer, whence we
went in thirty minutes to the station opposite the Sacred Island,
whose solitary beauty was more enchanting than ever. We went on a
little old condemned dahabeeyeh and down to see the Bab-el-Kebeer,
the Big Rapid, not so big now, for the water is lower than for years,
but yet respectable as a ﬂow of hot water, though the rushing and
surging give you a sense of coolness. Then back to Philae where we
spent the rest of the day. Emil Brugsch called my attention to a crack
in a pillar of the fore-hall of the temple proper. It showed the surface
of an old temple stone and on it I made out fragments of the car-
touches of Ahmes of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. The earliest work
hitherto known at Philae, is of Nectanebo of the Thirtieth Dynasty.l
We glided back by railway and this morning early turned North-
ward; I think I said that two months ago. Half an hour we spent in
the ruins of Kom Ombos and then on until two P. M. when we were
quickly taken in charge by this sandbank. Our Arab efforts to get off
would be amusing if it were cooler. Fortunately a postal steamer
comes along to-morrow and will pull us off then.

LUXOR We got ofl~ ourselves at night, but yesterday had to
Tuesday coal at Esneh so that we did not reach Luxor until
April 12, 1881' eight this morning. . . . . (The diary for this

season is discontinued at this point.)
