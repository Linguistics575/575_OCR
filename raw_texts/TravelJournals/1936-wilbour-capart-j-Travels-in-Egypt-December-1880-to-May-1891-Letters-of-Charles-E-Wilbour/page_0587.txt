NOVEMBER 1888 TO JULY 1889]

March 17, I889 Lottie and I wrote to mother this day, I being

ﬁfty—six, and we had our hottest day thus far, 92°.
So we passed by several places which I want to see, rejoicing, and
came at midnight to Abooteeg. We might well have come even unto
Sioot, for

March 18, 1889 there came with the dawn a heavy north wind, so
that we were obliged to stop under the twin
minarets.

Marc/z I8, 1889 and also.

March 19, 1889 until eventide. This gave us much time for medi-
tation and the March magazines. I must not forget
that this morning we worked down near a mile and that when we
stopped Alee was accused of having scented himself abominably
with onions. Of course this scent was much worse in Lottie’s room. In
the course of the day I went up on the twenty-foot high bank and
there was an onion ﬁeld, two acres or so. The wind went down at
night and we started. After a spell of twenty minutes on the sand.

March 20, 1889 Two A. M. we went on at VVasta and staid, spite

of persistent effort, until eleven. Then I got ﬁfteen
more men from the village at ten cents apiece and we were of? in ﬁf—
teen minutes, and on our two-mile way to Sioot, where in the after-
noon we went to the Bazaar and found Dr. Doat, who had been to
Assuan and was going to join Crete in Cairo to—morrow and burn
him again. We got letters many and learned that Ned’s Inspiration
was sold. Seleeb came to see us in the evening. The Post is to be
taken by Cook in May. He takes the stern-wheelers with it. Our
Consul Mishragy is at Beni Korreh where he was in November.

March 21, 1889 Read the Herald: and afternoon we visited the
Girls’ side of the Mission. Saw Misses Kyle and
Hogg and Mrs. Oculist Lansing; Miss Kyle came in from the Thurs—

day female Prayer meeting.
