OCTOBER 1881 TO APRIL 1882]

Monday I must post this before going to the steamer. I can put a

table in my room one metre by sixty centimetres and my
trunk under it and I have shelves and hooks and M. Maspero wishes
to take the two arks along in case we should wish to photograph. We
shall send down for our mail this week and probably next and then
have it forwarded to us. Said has come over from the Pyramid to see
me 03'. Judge Hagens was over at eight this morning and we went to
call on Spitta; we found him better. Tomorrow we spend in one of
the pyramids and Wednesday and Thursday we go to Wasta so as to
go to the pyramid of Meidoom Friday. Then to Feshn. .
The face of the sky is wonderfully clear and blue; ill omens have
ceased; the cholera disappeared with the parrot and Arabil is in town
without making a sensation. The Wiedemanns will be at Luxor be-
fore us probably. Send me all the little news.

Deceméer 15, 1881 cabin, and it is comfortable and conve-

contributed and the seven-franc table and for seven dollars Mo-

I. Arabi: "Ahmad Arabi. Egyptian soldier and revolutionary leader (1839—1011). Arabi was rather the
ﬁgure-head than the inspirer of the movement of x881-1 882; and was probably more honest. as he was
certainly less intelligent. than those whose tool. in a large measure. he was." Encyclopaedia Britannica.
