directs the Reis Mustapha at the wheel. He borrowed of Mohammed
the brother of Abd-er—Rasool eight pounds, as a kind of levy on the
ﬁve hundred pounds given him for the Tomb of Pi-nezem,2 and the
Captain is retaining one pound a month out of his two and one-half
pounds salary to pay it. Hence these sands.
