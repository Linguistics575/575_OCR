[CHAPTER TEN

February 24, I891 Seheyl continued. I dined on the I star, the Pro-

fessor’s dahabeeyeh with Mr. Mitford and
Colonel Wodehouse who had ridden back from Darow on a camel
and was a little excited before the end of the meal. The Lebanon wine
is strong.

February 25, 1891 We took the Professor to the Newmans at Philae

to lunch and I ﬁnished my Osiris rooms. Mr.
Cook has for two winters given the painter and his wife the use of a
very small dahabeeyeh, the Nigma. This year they expect to buy a
larger one and continue the painting of Philae. They seem to enjoy
this life. Major Chapman, who went to the Oasis El Khargeh with
Golenischeff reports that the temple1 has been badly cut up; you re-
member a piece was offered me last year in Ekhmeem, which I rec-
ognized from Brugsch’s copy. At Luxor they have given a dinner to
Monsieur Grébaut to celebrate the ﬁnding of the hundred-and-
sixty-mummy tomb.

Fehuary 26, 1891 We set our faces northward, the mail having

brought our letters, one from Mr. Cuming
speaking anent the New Year’s card of the “world on Wilbour’s Pro-
jection.”

February 27, 1891 We spent the day copying in Kom Ombo and
were told that there were mummies and antee-
keh at Shoteb, two miles away, where we were last year.

Feéruary 28, 1891 Compared Rosellini at Silsileh in the after-

noon.

March I, 1891 I found some Greek inscriptions for the Professor in

a small southern quarry on the east side and then he
showed me two small chapels back of the great quarry,’~’ in part pub-
lished by Lepsius. I copied the rest, then we found another also of
