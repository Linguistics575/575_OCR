NOVEMBER 1889 TO MARCH 1890]

lunched with Aly Moorad’s wife, then walked to the races and had
dinner in the evening; it was too much. We took tea on Sayce’s
dahabeeyeh, and agreed to go up the river with him. He and Ned

and I spent the evening at Insingers.

yanuary 29, 1890 I visited Mohammed Mohassib. He has sold

anteekeh to Mr. Davis‘, Mr. Somerville’s part-
ner, for seventy pounds, wherefor he thanks me. The Somervilles
spent the morning with us. Professor Sayce and I walked in the
temple and he and his friend dined with us, also Mrs. and Miss Lily

Barret of Newport. All are coming in dahabeeyers next time.

7anuary 30, 1890 Saw Abd el Meegeed's twenty papyri found in

an earthern pot at Goornah. Eight are nearly a
foot long; of these but one is unrolled and that is demotic. I suppose
the rest are. Twelve smaller, and look like letters as they have
seals. I sent a description of them to Revillout2 at the Louvre.
Afternoon we sailed about four miles to Dabeeyeh.

7anuary 31, 1890 We stopped at Erment for its sweet oranges, the

best on the river, and for a two hundred twenty
pound bag of sugar at three and a half cents a pound. Mr. Marchant
made it while we waited. Then we came on to Rizagat.

Feéruary I, 1890 We stopped at a quarry behind Dabeeyeh,

where Sayce copied some Greek inscriptions of
the time of the Antonines and I a remnant of a hieroglyphic tablet
which for the ﬁrst time gives the cartouche of the Pharaoh, whom
the Greeks called Smendes. Ned and I dined on the Timmah. We tied
up at Mehallah.
