can his reputation fail to increase steadily through the Charles Edwin
\Vilbour Memorial Hall in the same Museum, enriched every year by
purchases of Egyptian antiquities through the generosity of the
\Vilbour family.

The late Mrs. Charlotte Beebe Wilbour, deeply interested in the
scientiﬁc work of her husband, desired to present to a public institu-
tion the library and collection formed by him. Their children, Mrs.
Evangeline \Vilbour Blashﬁeld, Miss Theodora Wilbour, and Mr.
Victor Wilbour, have carried out their mother’s generous and public-
spirited intention, founding the well-deserved Memorial to their
father. Victor Wilbour bequeathed in 1932, the necessary funds to
maintain and develop this memorial.

VV'hen Charles Edwin Wilbour died, an obituary was printed in a
Parisian newspaper, brief but signiﬁcant, and such as even the
proudest man—and he was modest—would have been glad to receive
in recognition:

Mr. Charles Edwin Wilbour, the celebrated
Egyptologist of Rhode Island, the brilliant,
courteous, kindly gentleman, whose candid
friendliness and open-minded benevolence
were so well-known.

Though he preferred all through his life to keep his scientiﬁc at-
tainments in the background, his Memorial Hall and Library will
stand as enduring witnesses of his devotion to Egyptological re-
search, and as the foundation for an organization to promote and
develop our knowledge of a brilliant age of human achievement.
