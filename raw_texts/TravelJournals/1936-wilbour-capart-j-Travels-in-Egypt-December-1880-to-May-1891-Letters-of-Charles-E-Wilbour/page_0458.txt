with this ﬁt inscription “A Gino Capponi” then after
beefsteak at nine to the Ufﬁzi and the Pitti where are so many
friendly faces. Renewing themselves they renew the past. I measured
the obelisk to make sure that it is the twin of that found in Rome.
After lunch I spent three hours with Schiaparelli looking at his pur—
chases in Egypt, which will add much to the volume of the Museum,
and then found Mr. Fiske not at home. I managed to make my sore
throat much worse. Madame gave me homeopathic belladonna.

Tuesday I woke in the night with a choking sensation which
May 11, 1886 was new. I seemed bound down by the clothes and
felt a nightmare need of light. It was not enough to

open the shutters; I must light the lamp. After two hours of tussle I
got my head high and slept and when the time came to take the train
it rained, andl thought I would not. So I have kept dry to-day and
taken two spoonfuls every two hours, and the throat is fast subsiding.
