four-oared boat. Our crew is diminished now to six with Reis and
their cook boy and three servants, seventeen only on the boat instead
of twenty-four.

Mr. Insinger writes me from Rodah ﬁve days ago that he is hurry-
ing down and I am glad for him to be here before we start. He will see
to the boat and to doing anything we want done and what’s more,
pay for it. That is what I call a friend.

I have not had time to call on anybody yet; Maspero’s brother
Hervé dined with us Friday; he is a very pleasant young man and is in
the Crédit Foncier.
