NOVEMBER 1890 TO MAY 1891]

February 18, 1891 Found us at our old mooring beside Elephantine

and with accumulated letters and papers to read.
Monsieur Gayet called; he has spent nineteen days at the old Con-
vent on the west side measuring and studying for a reconstruction.
Mr. Headlam, who is here to study Coptic convents, was content
with four days, a fair sample of comparative thoroughness. Professor
Sayce and I went to see Major Cunningham, but he had gone to
Suakim with his black battalion and Colonel Wodehouse Pacha and
Lieutenant Mitford, his aid, received us. On the way back we copied
many stones south of the Mudereeyeh taken from the temples of
eighty years ago. Afternoon they returned our call.

February 19, 1891 Professor and I went to Seheyl and bothered
long over half—eﬁ'aced pilgrim inscriptions, ﬁnd-
ing what seems a new cartouche and correcting and copying.

February 20, 1891 I went to Philae. Saw the Newmans and cor—
rected Rosellini’s copy of the Osiris rooms on the

roof

February 21, 1891 Lottie bought a Hindoo God which ornaments

the Salon, Mother Ganges, her name on Father
Nile. Herman Burr and his son, old acquaintance, whom we expected
last year, came from the Ramses; at dusk I took them back to their
ship which anchored below the town.

February 22, 1891 We took the Burrs to the convent and after

lunching with us they went away; they have
been round the world westward since we saw them in Paris a year ago
last fall. Mr. Ulrichs, a cousin of Mr. Limburger of Leipzig, came in
to say Mrs. Limburger had asked him to call and bring her greetings.

February 23, I891 The Professor and I continued Seheyl. Mr. Mit-
ford and he dined with us; Colonel Wodehouse

had gone to Darow.
