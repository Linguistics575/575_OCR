[CHAPTER FOUR

Luxoa Wednesday I spent the morning again in Karnalt
Friday and Thursday I mustered courage to cross the
March 14, I334 river to continue my map work. Aboo Gamb was
in Luxor; so the ferry boy said, but I soon encoun-
tered Abd—er-Rasool, who inducted me into a crevice of the rock,
just my size, which led into a tomb. He said he had shown it to Piehl
who had copied much in it. The proprietor Mr. Thothrnes—third-welll
was the master of the Artisans and the Works of his time and he re-
counts the monuments which he says he “saw his master set up,” an
ark of alabaster all one stone, a naos of alabaster wrought with gold,
a great gate of electrum, columns of precious stones wrought with
electrum, masts and obelisks many and much more which is de-
stroyed. Incidentally he began this forty cubit tomb for himself, but
it is unﬁnished. I say a forty cubit tomb, for I have found that it is
better to use the measure by which these tombs were built; then I
get round numbers when I measure them. Nearly all are in the
form of a Latin cross and the arms are the most important parts.
They are about so:

 

 

 

 

At a a hymns
a a The reigning King in a naos to whom negroes bring the products of the
Soodan along res and at add. Syrians bring vases, chariots and horses and
their precious things. At e is often a great tablet cut in the rock. 1When the
man lived long enough he dug out the long part of the cross towards the
west and the little room at the end in which he had his and his_wife's statue

cutintherock.
