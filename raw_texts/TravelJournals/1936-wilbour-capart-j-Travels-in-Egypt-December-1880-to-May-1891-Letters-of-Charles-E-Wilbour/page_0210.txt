[CHAPTER TWO

Wednesday Egyptian Museum and Uﬂizi, where are Bonnat’s,
Henner’s and Healy’: auto-likenesses along with the other painters,
Corregio and Raphael and Titian and Them.

Thursday to Pisa before nine where I worked on the Rosellini
papers1 and saw Mme. Rosellini, née Cherubini.

Friday, another day's work and back at night.

Saturday 29th I have been to Santa Croce and the Duomo and
bought a novel. I have already read two to revive my Italian. These
towns seem like old friends. I am rather rushing my head but I want
to get to Paris and I want to take a glance at them on my way. I hope
to go to Bologna and Parma tomorrow, to Turin Monday and after
a day or two there, to be with you, once more. I' wish you were here;
we would have a pleasant month in Italy.

Little Schiaparelli came to dine with me Wednesday and will
again to-day. He is setting up the Museum in admirable style, and
making the best catalogue yet made of an Egyptian Museum.2 But
why write when I can so soon talk? To breakfast.
