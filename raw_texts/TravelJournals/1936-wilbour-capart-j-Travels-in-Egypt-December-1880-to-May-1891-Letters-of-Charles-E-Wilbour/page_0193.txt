He is an Algerian Jew, nosed something so: 5 about as big as
Maspero and quite good looking, who has been sub to de Rougé in
the Louvre, then to Mariette at Boulak and now is Moufettish (in-
spector superintendent) of the twenty-seven thousand acres which
the Daira Saneeyeh cultivates, mostly in sugar and cotton, in these

EHendina and travelled therewith, stopping in people’s houses and
feeding themselves mostly, in the Fayoom and here and about
Minieh and Tehneh, regions little seen by tourists, because there are

seven had cleared the track for us, retrammed to the boat through an

easterly storm of dust.
