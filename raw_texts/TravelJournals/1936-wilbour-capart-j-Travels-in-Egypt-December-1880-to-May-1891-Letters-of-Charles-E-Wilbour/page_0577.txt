NOVEMBER 1888 T0 JULY 1889]

Last night came a telegram from Judge Kinsman at Cairo asking
where we were; this forenoon a second saying he will start tomorrow
and asking for a letter at Luxor. Lottie wrote him while I was at
Sehayl, but he can hardly get it for we know not by which of three
boats he comes.

February 12, 1889 To Sehayl where I copied the remaining nine

lines. We had the Lefevres at dinner. They had
been to Philae and were very much elated and not at all fatigued,
they said. Another card from Mr. Fisk saying they had been a day
on the sand two hours south of Keneh, no exertion being made to get

status-quo and took after dinner the Rais and Pilot over the difﬁ-
cult water to show them the way at night. They pointed out to me
the sunken rocks, marked by the swell of the water ﬂowing over
them, and said it would be dangerous to pass at night. I agreed with
them and said we would start at daybreak.

February 14, 1889 Long before daybreak I heard the men astir

and when I went on deck at four A. M. they had
already rounded the picturesque rocks on the south point of Ele-
phantine. I watched them near an hour in the moonlight, then the
wind rose and we came within ten feet of a black Charybdis and then
ﬂed to a reach of sand and tied up till daylight. After which we
passed Professor Sayce in the Gamer/cl: below the convent tombs
and rounding them saw the Sultana afar. She had started the day be-
fore us.

I wrote to Maria T. Obis, Philo’s cousin, as I had written to him
this day last year, the day of his death and she had answered the let-
