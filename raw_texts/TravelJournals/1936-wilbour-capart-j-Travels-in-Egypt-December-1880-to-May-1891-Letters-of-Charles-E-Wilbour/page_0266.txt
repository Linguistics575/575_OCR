[CHAPTER THREE‘

Pylon in front of the tomb of Mr. Fairhusband‘. Behind this and
before the tomb, is cut in the mountain a forecourt covered with
inscriptions. In the great tomb of Neboouenef is an inscription
of the third month of the ﬁrst year of Ramses II”, when the King
came down to the town of the South (for Thebes was called the
Town as London is) to do the bidding of his father Amenra. It
is related how he installed Mr. N. and did many other nice things
which are covered up. Some day I

will have it dug out and see what

it is all about. A crawl through the

tomb of Naace3 and down its well

and through a break into another

well and by that up into the tomb of

Ra--aya4 was rewarded by the sight

of that gentleman’s statue and

his wife’s well preserved and col-

ored, and also by a new thing with

a new word to name it. The new w
thing was something like this:
There are three of them together,
the two hiding the middle one. The
ﬂowers are red and the leaves green
and the whole are called Besroo.
They are offered by Ra-aya’s son to the spirits of R. and wife. It is
strange, but almost always after a very hard and dusty crawl I ﬁnd
something new to pay for it. There is something like this about some
of the royal mummies found at Deir-el-Bahari.
