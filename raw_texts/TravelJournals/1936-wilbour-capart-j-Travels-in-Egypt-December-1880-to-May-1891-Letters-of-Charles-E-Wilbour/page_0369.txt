FEBRUARY 1884. TO MAY 1884]

Saturday and we came to Assisi and reviewed once more the

May 3, 1884 lives and loves of St. Francis and Sta. Chiara. If his

father had set him at work instead of shutting him up,

the Franciscans might not have been. We drove up to the town this

time by daylight and I saw that the place from which our driver nine

years ago called the four men was right under the church and the
hotel. How far it seemed to us then!

Sunday We saw the Roman temple and the holy places and
May 4, 1884 the Giotto’s again and came the long way by Teron-
tola and Chiusi, where we had Montepulciano white

and red, to Sienna, to the Black Eagle again, but a Black Eagle with

quite new feathers and a ﬁne nest.

Adonday We have done all the sights again and Ned owns that

May 5, I884 Sodoma is a great painter and has made a lot of

sketches of the Pintoricchio’s in the Libreria of the

Duoma and I have bought a little ivory head of the noted wood
carver which I am sure you will like.

Tuesday We saw the little there is to see in San Gimignano
May 6, 1884 and came back to Florence where I found your letter
and telegram ......

Wednesday ..... I am very glad to have been able to make
May 7, 1884 this little journey. It was all interesting and Spoleto
interesting and new.

Thursday Ned came to the station with me and at seven-ﬁfteen
May 9, 1884 I said good-bye to him and Schiaparelli and came to
Venice with an Italian family of six persons and a hen
and a canary. It was interesting and the rain was over before we
reached The City of the Sea ...... I took Linnie and Mrs.
Hawes to the theatre last evening and am almost as sleepy as my six
Italians who had come from Rome. Now for Politzerl—and you may
answer this to “Poste Restante, Vienna, Autriche.”

 

I. Adam Politzer. Hungarian physician, born in I835. professor in Vienna from 1861 (Privatdozent) till
1906.
