[CHAPTER TWO

THURSDAY Daninos left us and Maspero and I rode again to the
A'pril 6, 1882 F airest of Seats. We worked rather late and our don-
key boys got restless and our reis told us that there
was a terrible Khamseen and danger that the funnel by which we came
in would be ﬁlled up with stones and sand. But there was no Kham-
seen inside and we worked till half past four. There wasn’t much of a
drift when we came out. Maspero is telling Madam of a big stone, ten
inches large he shows it, which fell as he was coming out. I saw noth-
3_ ing bigger than half an inch, but then
I came afterwards. It was rather cut-
ting in the desert, but crossing the green
E. W, land was comfortable. I have sketched
' from Maspero’s measurements the plan
of this pyramid of Teta. The three
rooms to the left are where the double
of the King, or his spirit, had triplicate
existence. There were his statues long
since broken, before which earthly offer-
ings were laid at the time of burial. Only
the middle and west rooms and the two
I l corridors running east and west were in-
scribed; only the four gable ends of the
ENTRA NC E two rooms, and the two corridors remain.
l In the Pyramid of Unas, nearly every
hieroglyph is intact.

 

 

 

Friday Brugsch came out this morning to paper-stamp Teta
April 7, 1882 and brought the letters, only one from Paris, the
other a note from Mme. Hagens to whom I had writ-

ten for an invitation to donkey ride with them this afternoon, Friday
being Spitta’s only free day. Unluckily I could not get in from lunch,
but there was no Khamseen and we had a very pleasant ride around
the Kom-el-Ahmar. The Judge staid at home to work; he looks to me
rather over-worked. I think Vincennes would do him good. Poor
Spitta has had such a gathering in his ear that his doctor cut through
the tympanum, fearing for the brain. This was his ﬁrst ride since.
The Judge told me they had ten courses for the “lunch.” .....
