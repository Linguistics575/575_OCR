MARSEILLES, ON BOARD I started in good time from Paris yesterday
Noveméer11,1886 morning and was to reach Marseilles at
midnight and have a good sleep, but at

Lyons we were stopped by a break in the line caused by the inunda-

Nubar, wife of the prime minister here, and her many attendants
were on board; she will give up her house in Paris. A huge man named

M. P., who for his devotion to Gladstone, lost his seat at the last
Election, has so much the eye and voice of Dick Busteed a score of
years back, that I have commended him to Richard and he will see
him on his way Eastward around the world. A new way of making
bicarbonate of soda has set him up. Rowland G. Hazard of Peacedale
has started a Company to do the same for us; it has received two
