[CHAPTER NINE

the Cook Steamer and contra-enthusiastic, Scotch Engineer Watson
and wife and partner Merrlees’ daughters, Mr. Goodwin’s friends on
the India, M. Bercke, fellow suffering traveler on the Gironde,
Marcus Simiaka, and Ahmed Bey, Hassan Speke’s father-in-law,
whom I visited in the Spring. In his big house, Hassan leaves his wife
and ﬁve children, ﬁve and a half he says. The boat was much
praised and we ﬁnd the plate glass a great comfort; we can look
through it with an opera glass, and the back mirrors enable us to see
forward well. It is like having the windows open. I am not quite
content with the cut of the new balacoon, the after sail. It is too much
biassed at the bottom, which makes it belly; I ordered it ﬂat. In-
singer cut his own sails ﬂat and they work better. Besides the bias
reduces the forty-ﬁve extra square yards which I meant to gain,
to thirty-ﬁve. However, Aboo Shanab and I will pow-wow over it
and let out what is taken in, perhaps. Nefady has a bad hand which
we dress twice a day with iodine for the circumference and vaseline
for the centre. The virus begins to yield. His brother Mohammed is
with us and a Siootee of Berber parentage, called Mohammed
Libiad (the white) because he is so black.

December 26, 1889 We started and made three miles.

Deeeméer 27, 1889 \Ne came on merrily by the Pyramids, nor
stopped until Kafr Amar, splendid sailing,

exhilarating.
December 28, 1889 Going on; we mail this soon after ten.

MINIEH The Greek Apothecary told me that the misery
Deeeméer 31, 1889 of the folk was greater than he had known. We
came on at night to Beni Hassan.

7anuary I, 1890 We examined the tomb of Khnumhotep, the

ravages in which I had heard of in Cairol. Of the
great inscription around the large room next the ground, nearly all
the cartouches have been cut out, destroying a width of a line and a

 

I. For the amount of destruction see Percy E. Nest-berry. "Beni Hasan." Part 1. London. 1893. pl. XXV -
XXVI.
