TEMPLE OF ESNEH. 153

branch, bound together in a sort of sheaf ;
and yet, though dissimilar, producing no inhar-
monious effect. These pillars are about ﬁfty
feet high, admirably proportioned in their cir-
cumference, and are covered with hieroglyphics,
and with the ovals, or cartouches, of several
kings. The walls are sculptured all over with
those strange devices peculiar to ancient Egyp-
tian art, which leave one doubtful, at a ﬁrst
glance, whether they were intended for cari-
catures to amuse the multitude, or as mys-
terious symbols, whose meaning was conﬁded
to the initiated few alone. On the ceiling is
to be seen the famous Zodiac—no, it is not
to be seen, for we could not distinguish it in
the twilight that reigns within—but there it
is, or was—similar to the one at Dendera 3
and many are the travellers, and even men of
science, whom this Zodiac has puzzled or mis-
led as to the actual epoch of the construction
of the Temple of Esneh. \Vith this question
my ignorance forbids me to meddle; all that
I can aver is, that I returned to my boat per-
fectly intoxicated with the delight which a View
of this splendid specimen of Egyptian archi-
tecture had occasioned me.
