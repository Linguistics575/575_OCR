greater part English; but among them I found only
two females who had preceded me there, both of
them my countrywomen. My own name was of
course added to this primitive Litre des Voyageurs,

On returning to W'adi Halfa, we found that
during our absence the Dahabieh had undergone
a complete metamorphosis, the main-mast having
been struck and laid on the roof of the cabins,
the deck planks taken up to make room for the
rowers (for we are to be rowed down the
stream), the kitchen removed, &c. &c. All this
is preparatory to our descending the river, where
sails would be worse than useless to us, and where

of our men to make head against the northerly
winds. To—morrow we commence our return to
the Land of Egypt, but as we have all the tem-
ples of Lower Nubia to visit in our progress
