nicians were the ﬁrst people who colonized the
island of Malta. Curiosity has, in this instance,
nothing to grapple with but conjecture; the
skull may be that of a slave, or of a sacriﬁced
captive, and not of a colonist ; but, if one so igno-
rant as myself might venture a surmise, where so
many learned persons have refrained from offer-
ing an opinion, I should place the date of these
ruins to a far earlier period even than Phoenician
colonization, which, wherever it transported itself,
left indications of a more advanced progress in
the arts than is here discoverable. For instance,
if we admit for a moment that side of the camm
gzcdzstz'o which attributes those mysterious monu-
ments, the Round Towers of Ireland, to Phoenician
origin, it is impossible to reconcile the idea that
the shapeless temple of Hagiar Chem could have
been coeval with, or constructed by, a people who
were the artiﬁcers of those beautiful and symme-
trical monuments. In short, its very uncouth-
ness authorizes the inference that it was the ﬁrst
attempt of an untaught people in architectural or
monumental art.

Are you tired of my disquisition? if you are
