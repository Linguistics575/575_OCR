X A WORD TO THE PUBLIC.

scenes, the familiarity of epistolary style which
reduces writing to conversation—to more chit-
chat, if you will—are elements all too ﬂimsy to
satisfy the solid cravings of the public, we suffer
ourselves to be tickled into a too easy acqui-
escence, and are only aroused to a just sense of
our folly when those agreeable sensations are
replaced by a stinging application of the nettles
of criticism.

Courteous reader (for courteous, I venture to
hope you will prove to me), need I add that all this
generalizing applies particularly to my own case?
Or need I suggest that, if ennui should creep
upon you during the perusal of these Volumes,
and force you to close them with a yawn or an
impatient exclamation that they contain nothing
new—nothing that you have not already heard
better told more than ﬁfty times—you will exercise
justice in the midst of your severity, and instead
of directing the whole weight of your censure
upon my devoted head, reserve a due proportion
for the real delinquent—Mrs Harris !

PARIS, JULY 26, 1846.
