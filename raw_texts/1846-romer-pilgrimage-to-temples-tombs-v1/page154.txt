Kenneh, to all appearance left (i [a grace d6 Dieu.

After leaving Kenneh, the wind, which had
favoured us so far, died away, and we were com-

tracking, which, notwithstanding the clieerfulness
evinced by the sailors, I heartily wish could be
dispensed with. The distance overcome by this
process is inconsiderable, and the labour appears
immense; the work of horses instead of men.
However, these slow proceedings afford an oppor-

kept well supplied with wild doves and small
water-fowl. We see innumerable ﬂights of peli-
cans and wild geese, but these are quite beyond

the reach of anything but ball; and although
this is somewhat tantalizing to a sportsman, I
own that I rejoice to see the poor birds ﬂying
with impunity above our heads. Plenty of the
hawk, kite, and vulture race people the banks of
the Nile; unlike their species in our country,
which are only to be seen soaring in the high
heavens, they fearlessly approach within gun-shot
