PORT or ALEXANDRIA. 17

like aspect of the ﬁne harbour full of shipping, and
amongst them many men-of-war, from whose sterns
ﬂoated the Egyptian flag, with its white crescent
and star upon a blood-red ground, impressed us

close to the water’s edge, is the palace of Mo-

building; and far behind, towering in solitary
grandeur above all the surrounding structures,
is Pompey’s Pillar, springing from an eminence
which once formed the centre of ancient Alex-
andria, and appearing to the strangers eye as
a landmark of the past—all that remains to
attest the bye-gone glories of the fallen city
