THE FIRST CATARACT. 171

the impetus with which we entered the narrow
pass would carry us through it or not. And
often there was a momentary pause, when that
struggle rendered the boat stationary, while the
sails ﬂuttered like an expiring pulse;——but
again the breeze ﬁlled them, and the screams
and shouts of the two crews would be converted
into an hurrah of conﬁdence and triumph. At
each of those intervals, our good Reis Ali would
leave his post at the prow of the vessel, in order
to give me assurances of safety, and encourage
me with a cheerful “ Taieeb Taieeb .’ ” (very well,
very good,) by which kind process I became con-
vinced, that not only had we already encountered
some danger, but that more lay before us—a con-
viction but too well founded, as you will soon see.

I had established for myself a test of the safe-
ty of our progress, which inspired me with more
conﬁdence than the friendly visits of Reis Ali;
and this was our excellent cook, Hadgee Mus-
tapha, whose little portable kitchen, in which he
performs such great feats, is placed just opposite
to the awning where I was standing. There he
was, ﬁxed to his post, and, in the midst of the
deafening noise and bustle around, imperturba—
bly making preparations for dinner, which I be-

gan to think it doubtful that we should ever eat.
