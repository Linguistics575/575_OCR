124 EGYPTIAN CAVALRY.

order that Mohammed may go to market, and
which is the ﬁrst town of any consequence we
have seen since our departure from Cairo, there
is a large Egyptian garrison; and a cavalry regi-
ment has just come down to the river—side to
water their horses, some of which are very pretty
bits of blood, a cross between the Arab and
Egyptian horse, with ﬁne heads and good fore-
heads, and were they only better groomed, would
make either admirable light-cavalry chargers, or
beautiful Park hacks. The soldiers have all
capital seats, and the Egyptian Nizam uniform,
although a sad falling off from the Memlook
dress—that most graceful of all cavalry costumes
— is still superior to the Turkish reformed uni--
form, inasmuch as that the Egyptian soldiers still
wear the full Memlook White drawers conﬁned at
their knees with red garters, and their legs are
covered with close long white gaiters, such as are
worn by the Greeks and Albanians. The red
Tarboosh (similar to the Turkish Fez cap) with
its long pendent tassel of purple silk, forms the
head-dress of the Whole Egyptian army.
