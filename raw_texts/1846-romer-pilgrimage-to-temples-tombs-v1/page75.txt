5G VICE-REGAL ESCORT.

loped two men 011 horseback, followed by an
escort mounted on dromedaries, the foremost
of whom bore the Viceroy’s-prayer carpet; then
came the Viceroy, seated alone in an European
caléc/ze, drawn by four ﬁne greys, his coach-
man and two footmen dressed in scarlet-and-
gold Memlook habits ; and the corte‘ge was closed
by another escort upon dromedaries, carrying
the Pasha’s c/zz'bouques, enclosed in crimson~and-
gold cases, with their accompanying apparatus
of large silver censers for containing ﬁre. The
speed with which his Highness was driven com-
pelled the dromedaries to proceed at a long
trot, a pace which produces the most ludicrous
effect in those uncouth-looking animals; never-
theless we could not but agree that they looked
thoroughly in keeping with the corte‘ge of an
African potentate. Mohammed Ali graciously
returned the salutations of our party,—and we
galloped home to dinner highly gratiﬁed with
having obtained this passing glimpse of the
Lion of the East.
And now good night!
