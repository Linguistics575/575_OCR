102 RAILROAD TO SUEZ.

above all he prostrates the arguments advanced
for two other rival schemes, namely, the canali-
zation system which has been advocated in two
directions, from Boulac to Suez, and from Suez
to the Mediterranean. I shall not attempt to
follow him through the close and logical reason-
ing he pursues as to the difÔ¨Åculties that would
attend the formation of either of those canals,
but will merely tell you that I rest my adhe-
sion to his opposition to them upon the simple
fact that if either or bot/z, of them were made,
at least with

 

wait/zer- of them could be available
advantage. The one from Boulac to Suez would
involve such a complicated system of looks, that
the time required for the passage would be equal
to that now taken by the caravan transit; and
the one from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean
would be useless from the nature of that part
of the Mediterranean coast upon which it would
open, and which offers no safe place for the form-
ation of a port, and is all but unapproachable by
vessels. Mr. Galloway founds his statement of
this latter fact upon high naval authority, and
quotes an admirable letter on the subject from
Captain Glascock, R.N., whose experience on
that coast, and his skill as a navigator, both
conduce to render his opinion a most valuable

one.
