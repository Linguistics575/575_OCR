COLOSSAL STATUE. 3G7

statue of Rhamses Sesostris remains to tell of
the ancient splendour of this city, whose deso-
lation was foretold in the inspired words of
prophecy.* This huge fragment now lies on its
face in a large pool of water, which entirely
concealed the features from us. They are said
to possess great beauty and sweetness of expres-
sion, and have the merit of being uninjured,
which is probably owing to their downward
position; but I can only form a judgment of this
ﬁne relic from the engravings I have seen of it;
all that we could distinguish of the original was
an enormous ear and part of a Pharaonic head-
dress ; the rest appeared to us a shapeless mass.
A little farther on we stumbled upon a charm-
ing morgeau of antique statuary, half embedded
in the soil, and judging from the portion that
still remains visible, of extremely beautiful
workmanship. It is a small statue of rose-
coloured granite, which appears either to have
formed part of an altar, or to have been an
accessory to a statue of much larger dimensions,

“ Thus saith the Lord God ,' I will also destroy their idols,
and I will cause their images to cease out of N eph, and there
shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will

put a fear in the land of Egypt.” . . . “ And N oph shall have
distresses daily.”-—-Ezelciel, chap. xxx. ver. 13. 16.
