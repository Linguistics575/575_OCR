to be suspended for an indeﬁnite period. In the
interval, Galloway Bey died, but his brother,
Mr. R. H. Galloway, of Alexandria, has never
relinquished the desire and intention of eﬁ‘ecting
his project, and is still strenuously at work, both
in Egypt and with our Government at home,
endeavouring to awaken them to the advantages
which would result to bot/z from the execution of
such a plan.

Mr. Galloway has given me a pamphlet pub-
lished by himself on the subject,iii in which, with
a clearness and precision that leave nothing to
be wished for, he lays down to demonstration the
facilities for the undertaking in a scientiﬁc point
of view connected with the localities. Although
this is ground upon which I cannot venture to
enter, his manner of treating it strikes me as
being unanswerable. He points out the enormous
ﬁnancial advantages to be derived from it by the
two Governments of England and Egypt. and
