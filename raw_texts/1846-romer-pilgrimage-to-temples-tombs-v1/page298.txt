TALLYHO ! ‘ 277

had been warned to restrain herself, and she did,
for there was no absolute violation of decorum
in her performance; but in the sample she gave
us of her skill, there was neither poetry, nor im-
agination, nor ideality,-——it was “of the earth,
earthy,”—the nymph was a clod of clay, and her
inspirations were not warmed by one spark of the
few sacré, which sometimes for a moment converts
clay into something little less than divine!

As we were passing by a garden-wall on our
way back to the Dahabieh, a ﬁne fox jumped up
almost under our feet, and scampered away as if
a pack of hounds had been at his heels. A
royal salute from a double-barrelled gun was ﬁred
—-not at him, but over his head—in token of the
respect which the sight of his brush inspired;
and as he made his way towards the Libyan hills,
scared by such unwonted honours, the echoes of
Esneh for the ﬁrst time resounded to the in-
spiriting tones of a genuine Leicestershire Tal-
lyho I—and our Arabs, delighting in noise,
and taken by the novelty of the word, quickly

caught it up, and shouted again and again,
TALLYHo!
