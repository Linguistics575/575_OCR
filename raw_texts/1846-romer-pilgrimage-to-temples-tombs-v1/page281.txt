skirting the famous granite quarry of Syene, which
I have already described to you; and much did
I regret that we were completely shut out from
seeing the descent of the Swift; for from the
certain quantum of danger incurred, it must
have been not only a beautiful spectacle but a
most exciting one. then the boat neared the
rapid, where the principal peril of the descent

oblique impulse, direct its course upon the mud
island, where the safety of the boat depends upon
its being run ashore. It is afterwards easily eX-
