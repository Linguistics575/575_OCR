298 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

On the west bank of the river the following are the
most interesting antiquities :—

I. The Temple of Kﬁrnah. This temple was built
by Seti I. in memory of his father Rameses 1.; it was
completed by Rameses 11., by whom it was re-dedicated to
the memory of his father Seti I. Two pylons stood before
it, and between them was an avenue of sphinxes. This
temple was to all intents and purposes a cenotaph, and
as such its position on the edge of the desert, at the
entrance to a necropolis, is explained. In the temple
were six columns, and on each side were several small
chambers. The sculptures on the walls represent Rameses II.
making offerings to the gods, among whom are Rameses I.
and Seti I. According to an inscription there, it is said
that Seti I. went to heaven and was united with the Sun-god
before this temple was ﬁnished, and that Rameses II. made
and ﬁxed the doors, ﬁnished the building of the walls,
and decorated the interior. The workmanship in certain
parts of this temple recalls that of certain parts of Abydos;
it is probable that the same artists were employed.

II. The Ramesseum. This temple, called also the
MEMNONIUM and the tomb of Osymandyas (Diodorus 1.,
iv), was built by Rameses II., in honour of Amen-Ra.
As at Kﬁrnah, two pylons stood in front of it. The
ﬁrst court had a double row of pillars on each side of
it; passing up a ﬂight of steps, and through the second
pylon, is a second court, having a double row of round
columns on the east and west sides, and a row of pilasters,
to which large ﬁgures of Rameses II. under the form of
Osiris are attached, on the north and south sides. Before
the second pylon stood a colossal statue of Rameses 1].,
at least sixty feet high, which has been thrown down (by
Cambyses P), turned over on its back, and mutilated. In
the hall are twelve huge columns, arranged in two rows,
and thirty-six smaller ones arranged in six rows. On the
