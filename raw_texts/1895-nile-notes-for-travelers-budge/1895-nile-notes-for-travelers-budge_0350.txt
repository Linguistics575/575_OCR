ESNEH.

Esneh, or Asneh, 484% miles from Cairo, on the west
bank of the river, was called in Egyptian lyg Senet; it
marks the site of the ancient Latopolis, and was so called
by the Greeks, because its inhabitants worshipped the Latus
ﬁsh. Thothmes III. founded a temple here, but the interesting
building which now stands almost in the middle of the
modern town is of late date, and bears the names of several
of the Roman emperors. The portico is supported by
twenty—four columns, each of which is inscribed; their
capitals are handsome. The Zodiac here, like that at
Denderah, belongs to a late period, but is interesting.

EL—KAB.

El-Kéb, 502 miles from Cairo, on the east bank of the
river, was called in Egyptian lgj t3 Necheb; it marks
the site of the ancient Eileithyias. There was a city here
in very ancient days, and ruins of temples built by
Thothmes IV., Amenhetep 111., Seti 1., Rameses 11.,
Rameses 111., Ptolemy IX. Euergetes II. are still visible.
A little distance from the town, in the mountain, is the
tomb of Aahmes (Aniasis), the son of Abana, an ofﬁcer born
in the reign of SeqenenRa, who fought against the Hyksos,
and who served under Amasis 1., Amenophis 1., and
Thothmes I. The inscription on the walls of his tomb
gives an account of the campaign against some Mesopota-
mian enemies of Egypt and of the siege of their city.
Amasis was the “Captain-General of Sailors.” The tomb
of his daughter’s son Pahir lies just above his. 1n the
winter of 1894—5 some interesting excavations were carried
out at El-Kab by Mr. Somers Clarke; an account of the
results obtained by him will appear shortly.
