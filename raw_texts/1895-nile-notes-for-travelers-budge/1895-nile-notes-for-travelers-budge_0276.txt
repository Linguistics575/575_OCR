number of its ruined chambers are still visible. During the
years 1890, 1891 Mr. Petrie carried out some interesting
excavations at Hawara, Biyahmu, El—léhﬁn, Médﬁm and
other sites in the Fayyﬁm. The funds for the purpose

Beni Suéf, 73 miles from Cairo, is the capital of the
province bearing the same name, and is governed by a
Mudir. In ancient days it was famous for its textile fabrics,
and supplied Ahmim and other weaving cities of Upper

Fayyﬁm.

some under ground and seine above ground over them, to the number
ofthree thousand, ﬁfteen hundred of each. The rooms above ground
I myself went through, and saw, and relate from personal inspection.
But the underground rooms I only know from report ; for the Egyptians
who have charge of the building would on no account Show me them,
saying, that there were the sepulchres of the kings who originally built
this labyrinth, and of the sacred crocodiles. I can therefore only
relate what I have learnt by hearsay concerning the lower rooms ; but
the upper ones, which surpass all human works, I myself saw; for the
passage through the corridors, and the windings through the courts,
from their great variety, presented a thousand occasions of wonder as
I passed from a court to the rooms, and from the rooms to the hall,
and to the other corridors from the halls, and to other courts from the
rooms. The roofs of all these are of stone, as also are the walls ; but
the walls are full of sculptured ﬁgures. Each court is surrounded with
a colonnade of white stone, closely ﬁtted. And adjoining the extremity
of the labyrinth is a pyramid, forty orgyaa (about 240 feet) in height,
on which large ﬁgures are carved, and a way to it has been made under
ground.” Herodotus, Bk. IL, 148 (Cary’s translation).
