THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS.

The Egyptians, whom the sculptures and monuments
made known to us as being among the most ancient in-
habitants of the country, belong, beyond all doubt, to the
Caucasian race, and they seem to have migrated thither
from the East. The original home of the invaders was,
apparently, Asia, and they made their way across Mesopo-
tamia and Arabia, and across the Isthmus of Suez into
Egypt. ~ It has been suggested that they sailed across the
Indian Ocean and up the Red Sea, on the western shore of
which they landed. It is, however, very doubtful if a
people who lived in the middle of a huge land like central
Asia, Would have enough experience to make and handle
ships suﬁiciently large to cross such seas. No period can
be ﬁxed for the arrival of the new-comers from the East
into Egypt; we are, however, justified in assuming that it
took place before 3.0. 5000.

When the people from the East had made their way
into Egypt, they found there an aboriginal race with a
dark ‘skin and complexion. The Egyptians generally
called their land £33 Kamt, 216., “black ”; and if the
dark, rich colour of the cultivated land of Egypt be
considered, the appropriateness of the term will be at
once evident. The hieroglyphic which is read Kam, is the
skin of a crocodile, and we know from Horapollo (ed. Cory,
p. 87), that this sign was used to express anything of a
dark colour.* The name “Ham ” is given to Egypt by the

* “ To denote darkness, they represent the Tau. OF A CROCOmLE,
for by no other means does the crocodile inﬂict death and destruction
on any animal which it may have caught than by ﬁrst striking it with
its tail, and rendering it incapable of motion.”
