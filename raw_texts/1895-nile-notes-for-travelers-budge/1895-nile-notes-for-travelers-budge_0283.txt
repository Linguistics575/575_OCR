260 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

which represents the arrival in Egypt of a family of thirty-
seven persons belonging to the 35mm, a Semitic race, who
appear to have come thither to settle. The ﬁrst person in
the scene is the Egyptian “royal scribe, Nefer-hetep,” who
holds in his hands a piece of writing which states that in
the sixth year of Usertsen lI. thirty-seven people of the

Behind the scribe stands an Egyptian superintendent, and
behind him the Aamu chief Abesha, “the prince of the foreign
country,” together with his fellow-countrymen and women,
who have come with him : in addition to the eye—paint, they
bring a goat as a present for Chnemu-hetep. The men of
the Aamu wear beards, and carry bows and arrows; both
men and women are dressed in garments of many colours.
The home of the Aamu lay to the east of Palestine. In
this picture some have seen a representation of the arrival
of Jacob’s sons in Egypt to buy corn; there is no evidence
for the support of this theory. That the 35mm were
shepherds or Hyksos is another theory that has been put
forth. The paintings in Chnemu—hetep’s tomb are it
anything more beautiful than those in that of Ameni, and
they represent with wonderful ﬁdelity the spearing of ﬁsh,
the netting of birds, the hunting of wild animals, etc., etc.
In the other tombs are most interesting scenes connected
with the daily occupations and amusements of the ancient
Egyptians. The results of the work carried on at Deni
Hasfm by the Egypt Exploration Fund are given by Messrs.
Newberry and Fraser in Bani-final”, London, 1893, 1894.
