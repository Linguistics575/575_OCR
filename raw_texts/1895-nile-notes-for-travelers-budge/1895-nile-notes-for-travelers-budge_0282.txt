the reign of ($I HUM) 1% ( 'LL—LuJ—Ji ﬁr .12?) “ Nub

kau- Ixﬁ, son of the sun, Amenemhat,” the third king of
the XIIth dynasty. Of the history of this Egyptian gentleman
the following facts are known. During one of the expeditions
which Amenemhﬁt I. made through Egypt, he raised to the
rank ofa feudal lord and “governor of the hilly land on the
east of the home of Meh,” or Antino'e, the maternal grand-
father of Chnemu-Hetep. In the reign of Usertsen 1., the
son of Amenemha‘tt I., the title of nobility conferred upon this
man in the preceding reign was conﬁrmed, and a large tract of
land, lying between the Nile and the Libyan mountains, was
added to his estates; higher titles were also bestowed upon
him in addition to those which he already possessed. The
lands on the east side of the river, together with all his
titles, passed into the hands of his eldest son Necht. Necht
had a sister called Beqt, who likewise had a right to inherit
all titles and property. She married a man called Nehera,
the son of Sebek-fmch, and bore to him an only son called
Chnemuhetep ; it was for him that this tomb was built. After
a time, for some reason not stated, the inheritance of Menat-
Chufu,* which had been held by his uncle Necht, became
vacant, and Amenemhat II. handed it over to the young
man Chnemu—hetep, together with all the titles and honours
which his grandfather had enjoyed by the command of
Amenemhﬁt I. and Usertsen I. Chnemu—hetep married a
lady called Chati, by whom he had seven children ,' one of
whom, by the favour of Amenemhat IL, became the ruler of
Menat-Chufu. It has been said that Chnemu-hetep’s grand-
father was the 'Ameni-Amenemhat whose tomb lies close by ;
it is, however, distinctly said in the inscription on Chnemu-
hetep’s tomb that he was called Sebek—anch. This tomb is
famous for a remarkable scene painted on the north wall,
