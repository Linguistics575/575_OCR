38 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

The population of Egypt toiday comprises the Fellahin,
Copts, Bedawin, Jews, Turks, Negroes, Nubians and people
from Abyssinia, Armenians and Europeans.

The Fellé‘thin amount to about four—ﬁfths of the entire
population of Egypt, and are chieﬂy employed in agricultural
pursuits. In physical type they greatly resemble the ancient
Egyptians as depicted on the monuments. Their com-
plexion is dark; they have straight eyebrows, high cheek
bones, flat noses with low bridges, slightly protruding
jaws, broad shoulders, large mouths and full lips. The
colour of their skin becomes darker as the south is
approached. The whole of the cultivation of Egypt is
in the hands of the fellahin.

The Copts are also direct descendants from the ancient

such as Asyﬁt and Ahmim. The name Copt is derived
from 1:45 K715i, the Arabic form of the Coptic form of the
Greek name for Egyptian, Ale/dawns; it may be mentioned,
in passing, that Ai'ryvn'ros, Egypt, is thought by some to be
derived from an ancient Egyptian name for Memphis,

numberof Copts in Egypt to—day is estimated at about
350,000, and the greater number of them are engaged in
the trades of goldsmiths, clothworkers, etc.; a respectable
body of clerks and accountants in the postal, telegraph and
government ofﬁces in Egypt, is drawn from their community.
They are clever with their ﬁngers, and are capable of rapid
education up to a certain point; beyond this they rarely
go. Physically, they are of a ﬁner type than the fellahin;
their heads are longer and their features are more European.

The Copts are famous in ecclesiastical history for having
embraced with extraordinary zeal and rapidity the doctrines
of Christianity as preached by St. Mark at Alexandria.
Before the end of the third century A.D. Egypt was ﬁlled
with hundreds of thousands of ascetics, monks, recluses,
