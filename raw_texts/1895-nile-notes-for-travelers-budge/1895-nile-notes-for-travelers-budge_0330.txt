LUXOR (EL—KU§UR) AND THEBES. 307

visible the cartouche and other signs which indicated that
the inhabitants of the cofﬁns were royal personages. The
native who was so fortunate as to have chanced upon this
remarkable “ﬁnd,” was sufﬁciently skilled in his trade of
antiquity hunter to know what a valuable discovery he had
made ; his joy must however have been turnedinto mourn-
ing, when it became evident that he would need the help of
many men even to move some of the large royal cofﬁns
which he saw before him, and that he could not keep
the knowledge of such treasures locked up in his own
breast. He revealed his secret to his two brothers and
to one of his sons, and they proceeded to spoil the
cofﬁns of us/zaélz'u* ﬁgures, papyri, scarabs and other
antiquities which could be taken away easily and con-
cealed in their abéas (ample outer garments) as they re-
turned to their houses. These precious objects were for
several winters sold to chance tourists on the Nile, and the
lucky possessors of this mine of wealth replenished their
stores from time to time by Visits made at night to the tomb.
As soon as the objects thus sold reached Europe, it was at
once suspected that a “ﬁnd” of more than ordinary
importance had been made. An English oﬂicer called
Campbell showed'M. Maspero a hieratic Book of the Dead
written for Pi—net'em ; M. de Saulcy sent him photographs
of the hieroglyphic papyrus of Net’emet; M. Mariette
bought at Suez a papyrus written for the Queen Hent~taiu,
and Rogers Bey exhibited at Paris a wooden tablet
upon which was written a hieratic text relating to the
us/zabtz'u ﬁgures which were to be buried with the prin—
cess Nesi-Chensu. All these interesting and most valuable

* Usﬁaéz‘iu ﬁgures made of stone, green or blue glazed Egyptian
porcelain, wood, 810., were deposited in the tombs with the dead, and
were supposed to perform for them any ﬁeld labours which might be
decreed for them by Osiris, the king of the under-world, and judge of
the dead.
