404 NOTES FOR TRAVELLER'S IN EGYPT.

“ at the fall of the VIth dynasty, and who were in turn over—
“ thrown by the rise of the XIth dynasty at Thebes. As the
“ Xth dynasty in Middle Egypt was contemporary with the
“ greater part of the XIth dynasty, this limits the new race to
“ the age of the VlItlt to the Ith dynasties (about 3000 1%.C.),
“ who ruled only in Middle Egypt, and of whom no trace
“ has been yet found, except a few small objects and a tomb
“ at Siut. The extent to which Egypt was subdued by these
“ people is indicated by their remains being found between
“Gebelen and Abydos, over rather more than a hundred
“ miles of the Nile valley ...... The invaders completely
“expelled the Egyptians.” Their graves were square pits,
measuring usually 6 x 4 X 5 feet. “The body was in-
“ variably laid in a contracted position, with the head to the
"south, face west, and on the left side ...... A regular
“ceremonial system is observable ...... From the uni—
“ formity of the details it is clear that a system of belief was
“in full force.” *

at Dér el-Bahari by her architect Sen-mut, has been carried
out by MM. Naville‘and Hogarth for the Egypt Exploration
Fund,- the work has extended over nearly three winters,

Luxor or the Kﬁrna side, and every visitor will much
appreciate the excellent results which have attended the
completion of this great undertaking]L Archaeologists will

from the Temple 60,000 cubic metres of rubbish and stones, which
were carried away to a distance of 200 yards.
