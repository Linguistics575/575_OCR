one of the stelae in the Serapeum. The steps of the
pyramid are six in number, and are about 38, 36, 34%, 32, 31
and 29% feet in height; the width of each step is from six to
seven feet. The lengths of the sides at the base are: north
and south 352 feet, east and west 396 feet, and the actual
height is 197 feet. In shape this pyramid is oblong, and its
sides do not exactly face the cardinal points. The ar-
rangement of the chambers inside this pyramid is quite
peculiar to itself.

N efer—as-u, lies to the south—east oleie Step Pyramid, and
was reopened and cleared out in 1881 by M. Maspero,
at the expense of Messrs. Thomas Cook and Son. Its
original height was about 62 feet, and the length of its
sides at the base 220 feet. Owing to the broken blocks
and sand which lie round about it, Vyse was unable to
give exact measurements. Several attempts had been
made to break into it, and one of the Arabs who took
part in one of these attempts, “Ahmed the Carpenter,”
seems to have left his name inside one of the chambers in
red ink. It is probable that he is the same man who
opened the Great Pyramid at Gizeh, A.D. 820. A black
basalt sarcophagus, from which the cover had been dragged
off, and an arm, a shin bone, some ribs and fragments of
the skull from the mummy of Units, were found in the
sarcophagus chamber. The walls of the two largest cham-
bers and two of the corridors are inscribed with ritual texts
and prayers of a very interesting character. Unas, the last
king of the Vth dynasty, reigned about thirty years. The
Mastabat el-Far‘ﬁn was thought by Mariette to be the tomb
of Units, but some scholars thought that the ‘blunted
pyramid’ at Dahshﬁr was his tomb, because his name was
written upon the top of it.
