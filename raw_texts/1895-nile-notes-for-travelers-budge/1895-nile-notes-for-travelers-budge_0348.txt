new wine, the jars for holding it, and two servants making
offerings to Nekht of birds, ﬂowers, etc. In the lower
division we see Nekht instructing his servants in the art of
snaring birds in nets, the plucking and cleaning of the birds
newly caught, and two servants offering to Nekht ﬁsh, birds,
fruit, Elf.

In the other scenes we have Nekht, accompanied by his
wife Taui, making an offering of (film unguent and incense
to the gods of the tomb, and a representation of his funereal
feast.

The most ancient necropolis at Thebes is Drah abu’l
Nekkah, where tombs of the X[th, XVIIth, and XVIIIth
dynasties are to be found. The cofﬁns of the Antef kings
(XIth dynasty), now in the Louvre and the British Museum,
were discovered here, and here was made the marvellous
“ﬁnd” of the jewellery of Aah-hetep,* wife of Kames, a king
of the XVIIth dynasty, about B.C. 1 750. A little more to the
south is the necropolis of Asasif, where during the XIXth,
XXIInd, and XXVIth dynasties many beautiful tombs
were constructed. If the visitor has time, an attempt should
be made to see the ﬁne tomb of Petﬁ-Amen-apt.

ARMANT (ERMEN'I‘).

Armant, or Erment, 4587},~ miles from Cairo, on the west
bank of the river, was called in Egyptian Wﬂﬂm SET—5 Menth,

and iii 2%; Annu qemat, “ Heliopolis of the South”;

it marks the site of the ancient Hermonthis, where, accord-
ing to Strabo, “Apollo and Jupiter are both worshipped.”

The ruins which remain there belong to the Iseion built
during the reign of the last Cleopatra (13.0. 51—29). The
stonelined tank which lies near this building was probably
used as a Nilometer.
