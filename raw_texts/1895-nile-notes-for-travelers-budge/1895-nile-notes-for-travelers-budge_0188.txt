holding the libations offered is divided into a series of
cubits to represent the height of the water in the Nile—
meter at Memphis: 22 cubits in the spring, 23 in the
autumn, and 25 in the winter.

VIth dynasty. From Dahshﬁr.

I. Black granite statue of a priest kneeling. A remark-
able example of early work, probably before the IVth
dynasty. From Sakkarah.

2. Panels of wood for inlaying upon the false doors of the
tomb of Hesi-RE; they are splendid examples of the
delicate and accurate work executed by Egyptian carvers
in wood during the IVth dynasty. From Sakkarah.

962. Round, white alabaster table of offerings made for
Khu-hetep—heres, prophet of the goddess Maat of
Nekhen. Vth dynasty. From Sakkﬁrah.

3. Layer of clay and plaster painted in water colours,
with a scene in which geese are represented walking
along. The artist has depicted the birds with great
ﬁdelity to nature, and was evidently a very accomplished
draughtsman. This fragile object was brought from a
ruined rnastaba at Médﬁm by M. Vassali, and dates
probably from the IVth dynasty.

4, 5. Two libation tables found in a tomb near the Step
Pyramid (see page 241) of Sakkz‘rrah. A slab, resting
on the backs of a pair of lions, has a trench cut in it for
carrying off the liquid into a bowl, which stands between
the tails of the two lions.

IVth dynasty. From Sakkarah.

6. Double statue of Ri-hetep and his wife Nefert, “a
royal connexion,” found in a mastaba near the Pyramid of
Médﬁm, which is generally thought to have been built by
Seneferu the ﬁrst king of the IVth dynasty. The eyes
are ﬁlled with quartz or rock crystal. Mariette placed the
period when this statue was made in the IIIrd dynasty,
but Maspero thinks that it belongs to the XIIth dynasty.
