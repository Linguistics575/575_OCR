passage of No. 17, but in the other passages and chambers
warlike, domestic, and agricultural scenes and objects are
depicted. The body of the red granite sarcophagus of
Rameses III. is in Paris, the cover is in the l"it7.william
Museum, Cambridge, and the mummy of this king is at
Glzeh. The length of the tomb is about 400 feet.

No. 2. The Tomb of Rameses IV., about ILC. ”66,
though smaller than the others, is of considerable interest;
the granite sarcophagus, of colossal proportions, still stands
in rim at the bottom. Having seen the beautiful sculptures
and paintings in the'l‘omb ofSeti 1., the visitor will probably
not be disposed to spend much time in that of Rameses IV.

No. 9. The Tomb of Rameses VI., or “ Memnon’s
’J‘omb,” was considered of great interest by the Greeks and
Romans who visited it in ancient days; the astronomical
designs on some of the ceilings, and the regular sequence
of its passages and rooms are interesting. The fragments
of the granite sarcophagus of this king lie at the bottom
Of the tomb.

No. 6. The Tomb of Rameses IX. is remarkable for
the variety of sculptures and paintings of a nature entirely
different from those found in the other royal tombs; they
appear to refer to the idea of resurrection after death and of
immortality, which is here symbolized by the principle of
generation.

The Tomb of Rameses I., father of Seti 1., is the
oldest in this valley; it was opened by liclzoni.

The Tomb’” of Rechmaré~ is situated in the hill
behind the Ramesseum called Shekh ‘Abd al-leirnah; it is
one of the most interesting of all the private tombs found at
'l‘hebes. ’l he scenes on the walls represent a procession
of tribute bearers from l’unt carrying apes, ivory, etc.,

* No. 35, according to Wilkinson, and No. 15, according to
