8 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

on Egypt are Strabo,* Chaeremon,+ Josephusi Plutarch§
and Horapollo.”

According to Manetho, there reigned over Egypt before
Mena, or Menes, the ﬁrst mortal king of that country, a
number of beings called Shesu Heru, or “followers of
Horus ”,- of their deeds and history nothing is known.
Some have believed that during their rule Egypt was
divided into two parts, each ruled by its own king; and
others have thought that the whole of Upper and Lower
Egypt was divided into a large series of small, independent
principalities, which were united under one head in the
person of Menes. There is, however, no support to be
obtained from the inscriptions for either of these theories.
The kings of Egypt following after the mythical period are
divided into thirty dynasties. For the sake of convenience,
Egyptian history is divided into three periods :—I, the
Ancient Empire, which includes the ﬁrst eleven dynas-
ties; II, the Middle Empire, which includes the next
nine dynasties (XIIth—XXth), and, III, the New Empire,
which includes the remaining ten dynasties, one of which
was of Persian kings. The rule of the Sa'ite kings was fol-
lowed by that of the Persians, Ptolemies and Romans.
The rule of the Arabs which began A.D. 641, ended A.D.
1517, when the country was conquered by the Turks; since
this time Egypt has been nominally a pashalik of Turkey.

The date assigned to the ﬁrst dynasty is variously given
by different scholars: by Champollion-Fig’eac it is ILC. 5867,
by Bockh 5702, by Bunsen 3623, by Lepsius 3892, by
l.ieblein 3893, by Mariette 5004, and by Brugsch 4400.
As far as can be seen, there is much to be said in favour
of that given by Brugsch, and his dates are adopted
throughout in this book.
