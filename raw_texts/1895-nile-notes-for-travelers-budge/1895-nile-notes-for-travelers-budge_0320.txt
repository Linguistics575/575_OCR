LUXOR (EL-KUSUR) AND THEBES. 297

east, the visitor comes to a wall at right angles to the ﬁrst,
upon which is inscribed a copy of the poem of l’en—ta—urt,
celebrating the victory of Rameses II. over the Cheta,
in the ﬁfth year of his reign; and on the west side of the
wall is a stele on which is set forth a copy of the offensive
and defensive treaty between this king and the prince of
the Cheta.

The inscriptions on the magniﬁcent ruins at Karnak
show that from the time of Usertsen I., B.C. 2433, to that of
Alexander IV., 13.c. 312 (P), the religious centre* ofUpper
Egypt was at Thebes, and that the most powerful of the
kings of Egypt who reigned during this period spared neither
pains nor expense in adding to and beautifying the temples
there.

The fury of the elements, the attacks of Egypt’s enemies,
and above all the annual inundation of the Nile, have
helped to throw down these splendid buildings. The
days are not far distant when, unless energetic measures
are taken meanwhile, a large number of the columns
in the wonderful hall of Seti I. must fall, and in their fall
will do irreparable damage to the other parts of the build-
ing. It is much to be hoped that the public opinion of the
civilized world will not allow these deeply interesting relics
of a mighty nation to perish before their eyes. Steps
should at once be taken to keep out the inundation, and
if possible the tottering columns and walls should be
strengthened.

* The short-lived heresy of the worship of the disk of the Sun
instead of that of Amen-R5 would not interfere with the general popli-
larity of Theban temples.
