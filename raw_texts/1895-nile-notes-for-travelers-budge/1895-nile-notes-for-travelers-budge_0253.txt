230 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

Cheops is laid. Having laid the ﬁrst course of variegated
Ethiopian stones, less in height than the other by forty
feet, he built it near the large pyramid. They both stand
on the same hill, which is about 100 feet high. Chephren,
they said, reigned fifty—six years. Thus 106 years are

inscribed cofﬁn of this king were found in one of its
chambers by Howard Vyse in 1837. The sarcophagus,
which measured 8 x 3 X 2% feet, was lost through the wreck
of the ship in which it was sent to England, but the
venerable fragments of the coffin are preserved in the
British Museum, and form one of the most valuable objects
in the famous collection of that institution. The inscription
reads : “ Osiris, king of the North and South, i‘Vlen-kau-Rﬁ,
living for ever l The heavens have produced thee, thou wast
engendered by Nut (the sky), thou art the offspring of Seb
