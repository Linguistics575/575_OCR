DAHSHL‘JR. 397

a granite chest containing four uninscribed alabaster Canopic
jars was found, and in another similar chest a worm-eaten
wooden box, containing four Canopic jars, was also dis-
covered. The four sides of the box were inscribed, but
the jars were plain. While the ground of the galleries was
being carefully examined, a hollow in the rock was found,
and a few blows of the pick revealed a magniﬁcent ﬁnd of
gold and silver jewellery lying in aheap among the fragments
of the worm-eaten wooden box which held it. The box
was about eleven inches long, and had been inlaid with silver
hieroghyphics which formed the name of the princess
Hathor-Sat, for whom the ornaments had been made. It
would seem that special care had been taken by the friends
of the deceased to conceal her jewellery, and thus the
ancient spoilers of the tomb had overlooked it. Among
the objects found of special interest are the following :—

1. A gold pectoral, in the form of a shrine E, inlaid with

carnelian, emeralds, and lapis-lazuli. In the centre IS

the cartouche ostertsen II.r r r —% O B Q i

3. Gold collar-clasp, inlaid with carnelian, emeralds, and
lapis-lazuli, formed of two lotus ﬂowers, the stems of
which intertwine and form a knot, and a head of
