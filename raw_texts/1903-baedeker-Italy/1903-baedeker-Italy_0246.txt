window-wall are drawings of the School of Leon. da Vinci, and a few
specimens from his own hand, including some caricatures. — Opposite is
”Raphael‘s Cartoon of the ‘School of Athens‘, which should be carefully
studied. The dilapidated condition of the fresco in the Vatican makes this
cartoon of great interest and value, since here only we gain the full key to
the artistic motives of the painter. The deviations of the fresco from the
cartoon, with the exception of the additions of the sitting ﬁgure at the
foot of the staircase, the temgle-colonnade, and the portrait of Ra hael
himself, are unimportant. — n the exit-wall: Dramantino, 272. Ma onna

At the back of the library is the Romanesque church of Santa
Scpolcro (Pl. D, 5), dating from the 11th century, with a picture
by Gia/npietrino (Madonna and angels) in the sacristy. The Via del
Bollo leads hence to the W. to the Piazza San Borromeo, which
contains a statue of San Carlo Borrorneo and also the former —

Palazzo Borromeo (No. 7; Pl. D, 5). 0n the groundﬂoor of the
palace are three frescoes, historically interesting for their subjects
(card-players, players at ball, and a rustic dance); they are ascribed
to Micheline do. Bedosso (ca. 1430). On the ﬁrst story is a *Ploruna
Gamay (Pinacoteca) containing some important paintings and a
