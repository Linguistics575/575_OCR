Ferraro (30 ft.), the ancient Forum Aliem', situated 31/2 M. to
the S. of the P0, in a fertile plain, is the capital of a province, with
81, 301 inhab., and the seat of an archbishop and of a university.
It possesses broad streets, numerous palaces, and other reminiscen-
ces of its golden period, when it was a prosperous commercial place,
numbering 100,000 inhab., and the seat of the celebrated court

of the House of Este.

The famil of Este was probably descended from the Carlovingian
governors of eutonic origin and derived its feudal name from the castle
mentioned at p. 241. Ann )1. (d. 1097) became Count or Knouva ov

.‘ Esra under Emp. Henry IV. His son Wolf (founder of the younger branch
‘ of the Guelphs) was invested with the Duchy of Bavaria, and his son
Henry the Proud became the founder of the families of Brunswick and
Hanover. Folco (ca. 1097-1135), the eldest son of Anne was the ancestor
of the Italian house of Este. Obiuo 11. (d. 1293), who established a
permanent dominion over Modena in 1288 and Reggie in 1289, considerably
extended the power of his house. Niccolo 111. (d. 1441) summoned to his
court in ms the erudite Guart’no (1370-1‘60), who here laid the founda-
tion of a rosperous school of liberal learning. In 1462 Niccolo‘s son
Berra rece ved the title of Don or Moons an» Reooxo from Eng.
Frederick H]. and in 1470 that of Don or Fenaana from Pope Paul I .
He died in “it. His brother Hercules I. (1471-1605) and the son of the
latter, Alphonso I. (150034), whose second wife was the infamous Lucretia
Bor la, were powerful and inﬂuential princes. Lodooieo Arlouo (1474-1533;
p. 8%)), the greatest Italian poet of the 16th cent., was in the service of
Alphonso from 1518. Though bloody feuds distracted the ruling family,
the city steadily grew in prosperity. Hercules 11. (1634-68) son of Alphonso,
was the husband of Renata, daughter of Louis XII. of trance, patroness
of the Reformers Calvin and Marot, to whom she accorded an asylum.
Having declared herself in favour of the reformed doctrines, she was
Dem-and from her husband and children. Her son Alphonso 11. (1558—97)
re d the glory of Fen-era to its culminating point, but with him the
family become extinct, his three marriages being childless. He was the
patron of the poets Tasso (mu-95) and 014mm (author of the ‘Pastor Fido‘;
born at Ferrara in 1537, died at Venice in 1612). Goethe in his ‘Torquato
Tueo‘ has drawn a faithful icture ot' the court of Ferrara about the year
1575, although a somewhat i eal colouring is given to some of the characters.
Hrs description of the attachment of Tasso to Eleonora (1537-81), the
youngest unmarried sister of the duke seems to have a poetical founda-
tion only. Anna (1581-1607), one of the sisters, was married to the Due
de Guise, and afterwards to the Due de Nemours; Luanda (1534.98), the
other sister was the wife of the Duke of Urbino. Alphonso II. was suc-
ceeded by dome «flue, descendant of a natural son of Alphonso 1., but
