Excursion from Milan to the Certosa di Pavia.

To visit the Certosa di Pavia we may use either the Runway to ('er-
im, on the Pavia-Voghera line, or the Pavia STEAK Tramway as far as
To": (it Almanac. The railway starts from the Central Station and takes
l/g~1 hr. (fares 3 fr. 30, 2 fr. 30, 1 fr. 500.; return-fares 4fr. 75, 2 fr. 50,
1 fr. 60 c.). The tramway starts about every 2 hrs. from the Porta Tici-

NASA, 2 r. 70, 1 fr. 80 e.). The whole excursion takes ll2 day.

The district traversed between Milan and Pavia consists of alter-
nate stretches of rice-ﬁelds and under-wood and offers little of in-
terest. At (41/2 M.) Bogoredo the Runway diverges to the S. from
the line to Piacenza (p. 333). —— 51/2 M. Chiaravalle Milanese, with
its Cistercian ‘Chnrch, a fine brick ediﬁce with a lofty domed tower,
in the so-called Romanesque Transition style, dedicated in 1221,
but partly modernised. The interior is adorned with frescoes by
Milanese ainters of the 16th cent. and contains choir-stalls of
1435. — 1/2 M. Locate,- 121/2 M. Villamaggion.

171/2 M. Stardom della Ccrtosa (Hotel de la Ville, déj. 8 fr.),
whence two routes lead along the enclosing wall (right and left) to
file entrance (W. side) of the Certosa (walk of 1/‘ hr. ; omn., 30 or
00 0.). — 0n the 8. side of the Certosa is the modest Alb. Milano.

The S‘rnsu Tnanwar follows the highroad and passes Binasco, with
an ancient castle, in which the jealous Duke Filippo Maria Visconti
caused his noble and innocent wife Beatrice di Tends (p. 45) to be put
to death in 1418. The station of Torre ds' Humane (Alb. Italia clean,
déj. 21/1, D. 4 fr., wine included), on the Noviglio di Pavia (p. 196), lies
About 1/: M. to the W. of the Certosa (omn. 30c.).

The *Certosa di Pavia, or Carthnsian monastery, the splendid
memorial of the Milan dynasties, was begun in 1396 by Gian
Gileazzo Visconti (p. 111) in fulﬁlment of a vow made by his wife
Catharina. The monastic buildings were practically completed
about 1450, under the direction of Bern. da Venezia, Cristof. da
Conigo, and others; while the church, originally begun in a N.
Gothic style, reﬂecting the inﬂuence of Milan Cathedral, was con-
tinued after 1458 by Guiniforte Solari (d. 1481) in the Lombard
Transition style, with exterior arcading and elaborate terracotta
ornamentation. Between 1491 and 1499 Gioo. Ant. Amadeo and
numerous other sculptors shared in the embellishment of the facade
of white marble (from Carrara and Candoglla, p. 179), which was
ﬁnally completed (lower part only) by Ben. Brioseo and others in
1007. The monastery, suppressed under Emperor Joseph 11. in
