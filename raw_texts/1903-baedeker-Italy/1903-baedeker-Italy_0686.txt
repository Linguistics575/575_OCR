possesses an interesting collection of musical instruments, includ-
ing some highly valuable violins and violoncellos by Ant. Stradivari.
Nic. Amati, and others (open free on Tues., Thurs., & Sat., 10-5).

The same building (entrance in the Via degl Alfani, No.8?)
contains the celebrated manufactury of Florentine Mosaics, founded
in the 16th cent. under Ferdinand I. and transferred from the Ufﬁzi
to this site in 1797. To the left is the Museo dei Laoori in Pietra Dun
(adm., see p. 437), containing a collection of the materials used
(Rooms 1-3) and of ﬁnished works (Rooms 4 & 5).

No. 54 in the Via Ricasoli is the entrance to the Gounr of the
Academy, where a statue of St. Matthew, begun by Michael Angelo.
as one of the Twelve Apostles he was to supply for the cathedral
(1503), is preserved by the rear-Wall.

At the corner of the Via Cavour (p. 489) and the Via degli Aru-
zieri, on the N.W. side of the Piazza San Marco, stands the Casino
di Livia (No. 59; P1. G, 3), a small but tasteful structure by Barn.
Fellini (1775). — Adjacent is the Gasmo Dr San Manco or Casino
Mcdiceo (No. 63; Pl. G, 2, 3; now a jury court), erected in 1576 by
Buontalenti, on the site of the famous Medici gardens, where Lo-
renzo il Magniﬂoo preserved a number of treasures of art for which
no place could be found in the neighbouring palace of the Medici .
(see p. 489). Bertoldo, the heir and pupil of Donatello, was ap-
pointed keeper, and round him clustered a troop of eager students.
No other school ever attained so great celebrity. Leonardo da
Vinci, Lorenzo di Credi, Giovanni Francesco Rustici, Andrea San-
sovino, Pietro Torrigiani, and, last but not least, Michael Angelo,
all owe their artistic education to the garden of the Medici. Duke
Cosimo I. afterwards transferred the collection to the gallery of
the Ufﬂzi.

A little farther on , Via Cavour 69, on the same side of the
street, are the former cloisters of the barefooted monks, or Recollets,
