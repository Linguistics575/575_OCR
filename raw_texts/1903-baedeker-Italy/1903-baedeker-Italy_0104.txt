24 PIEDMONT.

The lltsrom of the country is closely interwoven with that of its
dynasty. The [louse of Savoy (or Cam Sabauda), a family of German
origin, professing even to trace their descent from the Saxon Duke
Wittekind, the opponent of Charlemagne, first became conspicuous among
the nobles of Upper Burgundy about the year it“). Humbert I. (“Bian-
camano‘; d. 1056) is generally regarded as the founder of the dynasty.
Ilis descendants, by judiciously espousing the cause of the pope and the
emperor alternately, gradually succeeded in extending their supremacy
over Turin, Aosta, Snsa, lvrea, and Nice. Amadeus V1. (1343-83), known
as the ‘Conte Verde‘ (‘green count‘) from his usual dress extended the
power of his house in numerous feuds and warred in the East. Ama-
deus l’lll., raised to the ducal dignity by Emp. Sigismund in 1416, added
Geneva, Yereelli, and Piedmont to his possessions, and gave the princi-
pality its first legislative code. He retired to ahermitage at Ripaille, near
Thonon, in 1434, but was created pope as Felix V. (1439-49) by the Council
of Heels and died in 1151. — Situated between the two great mediazval
powers of France on one side, and Austria and Spain on the other, the
princes of Savoy frequently changed sides, and although sometimes over-
taken by terrible disasters, they contrived to maintain, and even to extend,
their territory. At one period the greater part of the Duch ' was annexed
to France, but Emmanuel Philibert (‘Testa di Ferro‘, 1553- ) restored it
to its original extent, and became its second founder. This rince spent

years as a general in the service of Charles V. and won t 6 battle of
St. Quentin for Philip 11. Under his son Charles Emmanuel I. (1580-1630)
the Duchy again became dependent on France. From the sons of this
prince are descended the elder branch of the family, which became extinct
in 1831, and the younger Carignano line, which succeeded to the throne
in the person of Carlo Alberto. The following dukes were Vittorio Amedeo 1.
(1630—37), Francesco Giacinto (1637-38), Carlo Emanuele 11. (1638-75), and
l’ittorio-Amedeo 11. (16754780). The last of these, having boldly allied him-
self with Austria during the S anish War of Succession, managed to throw
off the French suzerainty (170 ); he obtained Sicily as his reward, which
island, however, he was afterwards obliged to exchange for Sardinia (1720),
and in 1713 assumed the title of Kmo, which was subsequently coupled
with the name of the latter island. llis successors were Carla EmanueIe 11!.
(1730-73), and Vittorio Amedeo 111. (1773-96). After the battle of Turin
(1706), in which Prince Eugene commanded the Imperialists, the Piedmont
use princes directed their attention to Prussia, which served as a model
for the organisation of their kingdom. In both countries the military
and feudal element preponderated, and both were obliged to succumb
to the new powers evolved by the French Revolution. Carlo Emanuele 1 V.
(1796-1802) was deprived of all his continental possessions by the French
in 1798, and restricted to the island of Sardinia which was protected
by the English tleet. Vittorio Emanuele I. (1802-2’1) was at length rei‘n-
stated in his dominions, with the addition of Genoa, by the Congress of
Vienna. The Napoleonic period had swept away the feudal institutions
of Piedmont, and had bequeathed in their stead many of the beneﬁts of
modern legislation, and high military renown. It is therefore intelligible
that the clerical reaction, which set in with the king‘s return, gave rise
to an insurrection which caused the king to ahdicate, and had to he
quelled by Austrian troops. llis brother Carlo Felice (1821-51) adhered
faithfully to Jesuitical principles, and lived on the whole in accordance
with his motto, ‘Non sono re per esscre seccato‘ (‘worrlcd‘). The older
line of the House of Savoy became extinct with thlstrince, and was
succeeded by the collateral line of Carignano (p. 40; th April, 1831).
Carlo Alberto (b. 1798) who had been educated at a French milieu-5:
school, and had headed the insurrection of 1821, was protected by France
and Russia against the attempts of Austria to deprive him of his claims
to the throne. Ilis own experiences, and the force of circumstances,
rendered him an implacable enemy of Austria. With him began the
national development of Piedmont, although his efforts were not always
consistent. The liberals called him the ‘R0 Tentcnna‘ (the vacillating),
while in 18413 he himself described his position as being ‘bctween the
