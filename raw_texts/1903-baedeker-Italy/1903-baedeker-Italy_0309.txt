the like, occupies a picturesque and attractive situation, with the
country-houses of many of the Italian noblesse, and is a suitable
spot for a lengthened stay during the summer months. The Villa
Ducale, adjoining the Alb. Mllano on the W., belongs to the Duch—
ess of Genoa, and the new building in the park belongs to her son
the Duke of Genoa. —- About 10 min. above the village, to the S.
