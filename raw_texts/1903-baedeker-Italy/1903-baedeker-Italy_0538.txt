The town was perhaps foundedahﬁ the Ligurians and efterwerds oc-
cu ied by the Umbrians (ca. 800— 3.0.?) and the Etruscans (ce. HI)-
“1830.), who named it Feleina. It was afterwards conquered by the
Gallic Boii, end by them celled Bonom'a. In the Punic War it espoused
the ceuse of Hannibal after which, 3.0. 189, it was converted into a
Roman colony, a little hefore Perms and Mutina (Modeue), by the consul
C. leius, and as such wee a place of very great importance. It after-
wards belonged to the Greek Exerchate, end then to the Lombards and
Franks. In 1112 Emp. Henry V. constituted Bologna a free town (whence
its motto ‘Libertat‘). The Usmnslﬂ, said to have been originally
founded by Theodosius the Great (4.25), acquired a European reputation
as a School of J rudmz under Interim, who introduced the study of

of the North. In the 12-18th cent. their number wee generally 3-5000
and in 1282 it is said to have attained to nearly 10,111). The study of med-
icine and philosophy was introduced at a later period, and a theological
faculty was established by Pope Innocent VI. The anatomy of the human
frame was ﬁrst taught here in the 14th cent. , and gelvenism was disco
vered here by Luigi Galvam' in 1789. It is a remarkable fact that the uni-
vereity of Bologna hes numbered women among its professors. Thus, in
the 14th cent., Novella d‘Andrea, a. lady of great personal attractions, who
is said to have been concealed by e curtain during her lectures; at a subse-
yent period Laura Bani (d. 1778; mathematics end physical science),

Bologna acted a very prominent part in the contests of the Guelphs
and Ghibellines; as a member of the league of Lombard cities it espoused
the cause of the former in 1167, end ellied itself with the Pope against
Emp. Frederick H. In a ssnguinery encounter at Fossalta, in May, 12”.
King Ernie, son of the Emperor, was captured by the Bologuese, who
kept him in conﬁnement for the rest of his life (22 years, p. 366). The
possession of Bologna was energetically disputed in the 14th cent. by the
Pepoli of Bologna, the Vimmb‘ of Milan, and the apes; but in 1101 the
powerful family of the Bento‘vaqli succeeded in mak ng themselves masters
of the city. Protracted feuds with the papal throne followed, until in
1506 P0 Julius II. incorporated Bologna with the States of the Church.
In 151 the interview of Pope Leo X. with Francis 1. of France took
place at Bologna, and in 1529, 1530, and 1532 those of Clement VII. with
Emp. Charles V. Here, too, the Council of Trent held a meeting in 15h.

revolutions broke out, and in 1860 the town ﬁnally united itself to the
kingdom of Italy.

In the History of Art Bologna did not attain to any distinction till
s. comparatively late period. In the Gothic era it at length became an-
bitlous of possessing within its walls the largest church in Italy. To
this ambition it was indebted for San Pctranfo, which, had it been com-
pleted, would have surpassed in size all the other cathedrals in Italy.
Unfortunately, however, it remained a torso, and gave rise to innu-
merable disputes. The EARLY Rsnsrsssxcn style is abundantly represented
here. The Palatial Edi/ices, constructed of brick , with their ground
ﬂoors opening in arcades towards the street, impart a peculiar charm to
the town. Baldauan Pevvui (1481-1536), the famous Sienese architect.
