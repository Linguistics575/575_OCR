contains the natural history collection of the celebrated Spotlanzrmi
Lb. at Scandiano, see below, in 1729, d. 1799), an interesting

vince, and a ‘Gliptoteca‘, containing sculptures from Reggie and
its vicinity. —— The Biblioteca Municipal: (Pl. 2; B, 4) Via Farini 5,

Excunsxon 'ro Cutout (see inset map on the plan of Reggie), 8 hrs. there
and back; carriage with one horse 12-16, with two horses 20-25 t‘r. (luncheon
should be brought from Reggie). The drivers usually prefer the route vii
Quaara Gastella, with the ruins of four castles which once belonged to the
Countess Matilda of Tuscany (d. 1115), 51m Polo d‘Enta (p. 346), and Vice,
to Diane d‘Enza. whence a bridle-path ascends to the castle. The drive
vii Pujansllo and Pecon‘le (785 ft.) is, however, prettier, and beyond the
latter village the route (on horseback or on foot) cannot be mistaken.
The path leads through the village, and then to the right towards the
church of Canola, which is left on the hill to the right; at the angle
of the hill Canossa comes in sight, and the path leads in the direction
of the village along the Campola. The walk to the foot of the castle-hill
takes 1 hr.; we then ascend for 1/1 hr. in the direction of the church
of San Paolo. which lies three-quarters of the way up the hill, follow a
level path round the castle-rock and at .the back of the small village of
Cancun, and lastly mount to the summit of the rock, which is crowned
by the scanty, ivy—clad ruins of the castle of Cancun. The castle once
belonged to the Countess of Tuscan above mentioned and was destroyed
by the inhabitants ot'Reggio in 1&6. The Emp. H’enry 1V. performed
penance here in presence of Pope Gregory VII. during three days in 1077.
Magniﬁcent ‘View of the Apennines towards the 8., with the well—preserved
castle of Rossena in the foreground. and of the vast plain of the Po towards
the N., with Parma. Reggie, and Medeua. —— From Canosea to Purma via
