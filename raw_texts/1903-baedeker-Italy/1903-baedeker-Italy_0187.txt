to Ventimiglia. SAN REMO. 17. Route. 89

The train crosses'the broad and stony bed of the Impero, which
the road crosses to the left by a suspension-bridge. — 70 M. Porto
Isurisio (Hotel de France, at the station; Commercio, in the town),
with 7207 inhab. and a good harbour, is most picturesquely situated
on a promontory amidst dense olive-groves. Olive-oil is the staple
commodity, the ﬁnest kinds being produced here and at Oneglia.
Porto Maurizio, with a ﬁne domed church and a charming Gisrdino
Pubblico, is visited for sea-bathing.
~ 73 M. San Lorenzo alMare. The low, massive towers which rise
at intervals along the coast to the right of the line, some of them
converted into dwelling-houses, were erected in the 9th and 10th
centuries. — 771/, M. Santa Stefano - Rivaligure. To the right on
the hill is the fortiﬁed Santa Stefano. The train crosses the Taggia,

beyond which is (791/2 M.) the station of Taggia.

The picturesque little town of Taggis (cum. from San Remo, p. 90)
lies 2‘]: M. up the valley of the river. Gian. Dom. Rufﬁm’ (1807—81), poet
and patriot, lived here from 1875 till his death. The road goes on vii
(7 H.) Badahwco, at the beginning of the San Remo scqueduct, and Man-
talto to (121/2 M.) More. ﬁnely situated among the mountains.

Beyond a short tunnel a valley on the right affords a charming
View of Buasana Vccchia, romantically perched on a hillock. The
ruins of this villsge, which was completely destroyed by the earth-
quake of 1887, are worth visiting (key of the mined church at
Bussana Nuova, 11/211. lower down). The village opposite is
Poggio, which ﬁrst becomes visible. Then a tunnel under the
Capo Verde.
