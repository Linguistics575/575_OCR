244 Route 39. View“. Pram Verona

Duomo (Pl. B, 3), consisting of a broad and low Gothic nave
with wide vaulted arches, side-chapels in place of aisles, a Renais-
sance choir, much raised, and dome, and a crypt of the 18th century.
In the 4th chapel to the left are frescoes and a Madonna with saints
by Bart. Mantegna, in an old frame; in the 5th to the right is a
Death of the Virgin by Lor. Vemsiano (1366). — To the right in
the piazza is the Vcscooado, or episcopal palace, with a facade of
1819; the court to the right contains an elegant little early-Renais-
sance arcade by Tomm. Fromentone (1494). The piazza is em-
bellished with a Statue of Victor Emmanuel 1]., by Benvenuti,
erected in 1880. '

We continue to follow the Corso. 0n the left is the Gothic
Palazzo Thiene, and farther on, beyond the Contrada Pozzo Rosso
(p. 246), is the Pal. Braschi (usually known as the Casino Vecchio),
two Gothic ediﬁces of the 15th century. On the right, beyond the
Contrada Cavour, is the handsome Palazzo Porto (formerly Pal. Tris-
sino—Bauon), by Scamozzi (1588-1662).

The Contrada Cavour leads to the handsome PIAZZA nn‘ Sronom,
with two columns of the Venetian period. Here rises the ”Basilica
Palladiana (Pl. 0, 2, 3), with its grand colonnsdes in two stories,
the lower Doric, the upper Ionic, surrounding the Palazzo delta
Regions (town-hall), an earlier building in the pointed style. These
colonnades, begun in 1549 but not ﬁnished until 1614, are one of
Palladio’s earliest works. 0n the ﬁrst ﬂoor is a large hall with a
ﬁnely vaulted wooden roof (not always open). The slender red brick
tower is 265 ft. in height. Adjacent, at the corner of the Piazza
della Biava, is the Tribunals. — Opposite the Basilica is the un-
ﬁnished Loggia del Capitanio (p. 250), also by Palladio (1571), over-
laden with plastic embellishments; it now belongs to the Municipio.
Adjoining it on the right is the Monte dz“ Plato, erected in 1704 for
the Bibliotera Bertoliamt, by Ant. Muttoni. — By the Basilica rises
a Status of Palladio in marble, by Gajassi (1859).

We return to the Corso, in which, to the left, beyond the Con—
trada Giacomo Zanella (p. 245), are the Pal. Da Schio (Gothic, with
early-Renaissance portal) and, at the end of the Corso, the Casa di
Palladio, the facade of which was once painted (1566). We next
reach, on the right, in the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele, the —

[also Civico (P1. 0, 2), established in the Pal. Chien‘cati, one
of Palladio'a ﬁnest ediﬁces, seriously injured in 1848, but restored
in 1855 (open daily 11-2, free; 9-11 and 2-4, fee l/2-1 flu).
