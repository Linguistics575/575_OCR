Pistoja (210 It), a pleasant town with 65,412 inhab. (incl. the
suburbs), is situated in the vicinity of the Ombrone, a small tributary
of the Arno, at the junction of the Leghorn-Florence and Bologna-
Florence (R. 52) railway-lines. It has broad, well-built streets, and
important manufactories of guns and iron-ware. Pistols are said to
have been invented at Pistoja, ‘and thence to derive their name.

Pistoja, the Roman Piston‘a, near which Catlline was defeated and
slain, 13.0. 62, was in the middle ages the centre of the ﬁercest struggles
between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. In the year 1300 the Gammon
and Pancintichi, or Black and White parties, mentioned by Dante (Inferno.
xxiv. 143), who afterwards extended their intrigues to Florence and in-
ﬂuenced the fortunes of the net himself, were formed here. Pisto's had
to surrender to Florence in 351. It was the birthplace of the eele rated
jurist and poet Gino Sinibalds' (1270-1336), e. friend of Dante, and of the
satirist Niccolo Farteyuerra (1674—1785), author of the Riceisrdetto.

In the Hls'roar or ART, Pistoja, which somewhat resembles Florence
in miniature, held an important rank in the early part of the middle
ages, and was foremost among the Tuscan republics in fostering artistic
progress. The older churches, such as the Cathedral and 5m Andrea
exhibit a leaning to the Pisan style, which was extensively in vogue in
the 12th century. At Pistoja we also meet with many of the earliest at-
tempts st sculpture in Tuscany, which are much ruder than contem—
poraneous German and French works of the same kind, and with several
of the names of the oldest artists (Gratuitous and Modulus). After the
ma cent. Pisto'a became dependent on Florence both politically and in
the province 0 art. The town continued to be wealthy and ambitious
enough to patronise artists, but thenceforth those of Florence were always

employed. Of the Goldmith‘s Art we have an important specimen in the
silver altar in the Cathedral.
