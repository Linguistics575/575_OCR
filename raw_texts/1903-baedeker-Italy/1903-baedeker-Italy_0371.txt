sltar'on the right). Freseoes by Garcia, in the Cappella Spolverini,
to the right of the choir (injured).

A few paces to the S. of S. Eufemia is the ConsoPon-rs Bonsanr,
which begins at the Piazza delle Erbe and leads to the Ports. de’
Bonari (Pl. D, 3), a town-gate, erected under Emp. Gallienus,
A. D. 265, in the poor later Roman style. ,

To the W. this Gorse is prolonged by the Conso Oavoun (Pl. D,
G, 3), one of the chief streets of Verona, in which several handsome
palaces are situated. Immediately to the right (N o. 10) is the Gothic
Palasso Pomoni (formerly Pal. de’ Medici). Farther on, to the left,
in a small piazza, is the church of Semi Apostoli (P1. D, 3), with
very ancient tower and Romanesque apse. In front of it stands a
marble statue by Zannoni of Aleardo Aleardi, the poet and patriot
(1812-78). —— Also on the left (No. 19) is the handsome ‘Pal.
Bccilacqua, by Sanmicheli, now entirely neglected. —— Opposite is
the small church of SAN Lonnrszo (11th cent. ‘1), a Romanesque
ediﬁce, with round towers on the facade. The interior, restored in
1896-98, has galleries supported alternately by pillars and columns.
There are remains of many old frescoes, and in the apse is an altar—
piece by Dom. Brusasorci (1566). — Then, on the right, No. 38,
Pal. Portalupi, and No. 44, Pat. Cancun, also by Sanmicheli, with
s tine portico and court, but with an sttica added in 1770.

The neighbouring Piazzetta di Castel Vecchio (P1. 0, 3) affords
a picturesque view of the imposing pinnacled Bridge of the 14th
cent., which connects the Gastel Vecchio (Pl. 0, 3), the castle of
Can Grande 11. (14th cent.), now a barrack, with the left bank of the
Adige (open to passengers during the day). _

From the Castello to San Zeno, see p. 229. The Via San Bernar-
dino leads to the W. to San Bemardino (p. 228), while the Gorso is
prolonged to the S.W. to the Form del Polio (p. 228).

To the S. of the Corso, and connected with it by several streets,
lies the PIAZZA VI'r'ronIo EMANUEL]! (Pl. D, 4; formerly Piazza Brd,
from ‘pratum’, meadow), with an equestrian Statue of Victor Em-
manuel 11., by Borghi, erected in 1883. .

0n the E. side of this piazza rises the famous ‘Amphitheatre
(Arena,- I’l. D, 4), erected under Diocletian about A. D. 290, and
known in German lore as the abode of Dietrich (Theodoric) of
Bern, 106 ft. in height, 168 yds. long, and 134 yds. wide. 0f the

outer wall with its four stories a fragment only now exists.

Around the Inrnnron (enir. from the W. side by arcade No. V; adm. 1 fr.;
closed at sunset; guide superﬂuous) rise ‘3 tiers of steps of grey limestone
or reddish-yellow conglomerate (often restored since the end of the 16th cent.,
and partly modern), on which 20,” spectators could sit. An inscri tion
or the second story commemorates the visit of Napoleon I. in race, an the
restoration carried out by his order. Fine view from the highest steps.
Two doors at the ends of the longer diameter aﬂ‘orded access to the arena
itself (82 by 48 yds.).

On the E. side of the Arena, in the small Piazza Mura Gallieno,
is a fragment of the Late-Roman City Wall, brought to light in 1872.
