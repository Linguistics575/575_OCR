(p. 136). Over the second alter on the right is an alter-piece (Hollow
and saints) by Defendente de Ferrari (restored in 1899). Frescoes on the ceil-

Behind the high-alter is the Cappelle del Butt-sine Inderio or delta
Sanitarium Sindone (open during morning mass till 9 o‘clock, reached by
37 steps to the right of the high-altar), constructed in 1894 by Omar-int".
It is a lofty circular chapel of dark brown marble, contrasting strongly
with the white monuments, separated from the choir by a glass partition.
and covered with a curiously shaped dome. The monuments were erected
by King Charles Albert in 1842 to the memory of illustrious members of
his family: 0-.) Emmanuel Philibzrl (d. 1580), ‘restitutor imperll‘, by Pompeo
Marchesi; Prince Thomas (d. 1666), ‘qul maguo animo itallcam libertutem
armis edseruit nec prius dimicare destitit quam vivere‘, by Agull; Charles
Emmanuel 11. (d. 1675), by Fnccaroli; Amadeus VIII. (d. 1), by Cue-
ciatori. The peculiar light from above enhances the eﬂ'ect. In a kind
of urn over the altar is preserved the Bmttuimo Sudario or W
Sindcne, a pert of the linen cloth in which the body of the Saviour is
said to have been wrapped. This was brought from Cyprus to Chamber-y
