)5. Academy. VENICE. 42. Route. 289

Beginning to the right of the exit: 572. The ambassadors of the pagan
king of England bring- to King Maui-us, father of St. Ursula, the proposals of
their master for the hand of his daughter; to the right, the king deliberates
over the matter; 1573. The ambassadors deport with the answer that. the
bride desired the postponement oi the marriage for three years, in order
to make a pilgrimage to Rome, accompanied b eleven thousand virgins;
57‘. Return of the ambusadors to England an their report to the king;
575. Double icture, representing the Departure of the English prince,
who has reso ved to share in the pilgrimage, and his Meeting with Ursula
(on shipboard) ; 576. Apotheosis of St. Ursula, 577. Ursula, her companions,
and the prince receive the blessing of Pope Cyriacus (in the background
rises the Castel Sant‘ Angelo); ‘578. The saint‘s dream of her martyrdom;
579. Arrival of St. Ursula at Cologne; 580. Mutyrdom of the saint and
her virgins, who are pierced with arrows; and burial of the saint. — The
style in which the legend is narrated is almost too simple, but interest-
ing on account of the admirable perspective and faithful rendering of real
life. The traveller who has visited Belgium cannot fail to compare this
work with the celebrated shrine of St. Ursula at Bruges, painted by Hans
Memling about the same time (1489) for the Hospital of St. John there.
The execution of the northern artist is tender and graceful almost like

‘ miniature—painting, while the extensive canvases of his Venetian con-
temporary are vigorous, almost coarse in character.
