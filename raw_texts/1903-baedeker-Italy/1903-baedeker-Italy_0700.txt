510 Route 58. FLORENCE. h. Left Bank of the Arno:

The quaint and picturesque Ponte Veoohio (Pl. D, 6; pp. 446,
4-48), Over which the covered passage mentioned at p. 468 is carried,
forms the most direct communication between the Piazza della
Signoria, with the Ufﬂzi, and the Palazzo I’itti. The bridge is
ﬂanked with shops, which have belonged to the goldsmiths since
the 14th century. A bronze bust of Benvemlto Cellini (1500-72;
p. 444), sculptor and. gold smith, by Raffaello Romanelli, was placed
here in 1901. ’

For the Via de‘ Bardi, which leads to the left just beyond the Ponte
Vecchio, see p. 519.

The line of the Ponte Vecchio is continued by the Via Dn' GU10-
CIABDINI (Pl. D, 6), which passes a small piazza adorned with a col-
umn dating from the 14th century. 0n the S. side of the piazza is
the old church of Santa Felicitd (P1. D, 6), restored in 1736 and
containing a Madonna with saints by Taddeo Gaddi (4th altar to the
right). At the end of the street, to the left (No. 17), is situated
the Palazzo Guicciardini, where the historian Francesco Gnicciar-
dini (1482-1540) lived; opposite to it, on the right (No. 16),
is the Com Campz‘gli or house of Machiavelli (15th cent.; lately
‘restored').

The 'Pelano Pitti (Pl. 0, 6), conspicuously situated on the
slope of the Boboli hill, was designed by Brunelleachi about 1440
and begun by Luna Francelli, by order of Luca Pitti, the powerful
opponent of the Medici, whom he hoped to excel in external
grandeur by the erection of the most imposing palace yet built by
a private citizen. The failure of the conspiracy against Piero de'
Medici in 1466 cost Luca the loss of his power and inﬂuence, and
the building remained unﬁnished till the middle of the following
cent., when it had come, through a great-grandson of Luca, into
the possession of Eleonora, wife of Duke Cosimo I. (1549). The
palace, which somewhat resembles a castle or a prison, is remarkable
for its hold simplicity, and the unadorned blocks of stone are hewn
smooth at the joints only. The central part has a third story. The
effectiveness of the building is mainly produced by its ﬁne plo-
portions (comp. p. xlv), and it shows ‘a wonderful union of Cy-
clopean massiveness with stately regularity’ (George Eliot). The
facade is 119 ft. high and was originally only of the width of the
present top story. About the year 1568 Bartolomeo Ammanati
inserted the beautiful Renaissance windows of the groundﬂoor, and
added the waterspouts in the form of lions’ heads. In 1558-70 he
constructed the large colonnaded court, which is adjoined by a grotto
with niches and fountains, and the Boboll Garden beyond them.
The wings of the palace were added by Alf. Parigi after 1620,
extending the length of the facade from 350 ft. to 672 ft. The two
projectinggavilions were added about 1763.

In 15 the Pitti Palace superseded the Palazzo Vecchio (p. 445)
as the residence of the reigning sovereign, and it is now that of the
