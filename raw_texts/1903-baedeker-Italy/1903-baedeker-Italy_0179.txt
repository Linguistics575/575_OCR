A steep paved path. beginning at the Trattorie dei Cacciatort, a little

3o 0;: (1V 82) the Hotel Righi, descends in 20 min. to the church of San
m . .

The older line of roads, diverging to the left at the Spinnate Costel-
letto (p. 84), is known as the Via di Oirconvallaztm a Monte Inferiare.
The ﬁrst part of it, named the Corn Carbonara. leads to the Albervo def
PM or oar-house (Pl. D, E, 1, 2; 300 ft. above the sea), which has
room for £800 persons. It then takes the name of Com Ddgalt and re-
joins the main thoroughfare at the Castello d‘Albertis, adjoining the up-
per entrance to the Botanic Garden (p. 80).

The ‘campo Santa or Ctmitero di Stagltmo (open daily 9-6, in
winter 10-5; electric line 6, p. 68) is reached from the Piazza Ma-
nin (p. 84) by the new Via. Montaldo, which leaves the city by the
Porta San Bartolomeo (P1. 1, 3, 4) and then descends (views) to the
N. into the Valley of the Bisagno andto Staglieno (p 336). About
1lgli. farther on (11/, M. from the town) is the entrance to the
cemetery, which was laid out by Resasco in 1844-51 and stretches
up the slope on the N. bank of the Bisagno. We first enter a large
rectangular space, with sumptuous single monuments in the recesses
of the arcades, and beyond that is an oval space, with rows of
monuments in the recesses. Flights of steps and broad inclined
planes lead up to the upper galleries, the central point of which is a
rotunda, With a dome home by monolithic columns of black marble.
Above the rotunda, to the NE, close to the steep hillside, is the
tomb of Giuseppe Mazzini (d. 1872). —- In returning, we may use
the electric line (No. 10) along the Via di Otrconvattasione a Mare
{1). 83).

During the 19th century the Riviera suﬂ‘ered from Earthquakes in 1818,
331, 1854, an 01: the last occasion re eated shocks were felt in
the district between Nice and Finalmarina (p. . The increasing inter
vels between the outbreaks render a speedy recurrence of the disturban-
ces very unlikely.

The remarks at p. 65 on the luxuriant ﬂora apply especially to
the Riviera di Ponente. The railway penetrates the numerous pro-
montories by tunnels.

Genoa, projecting far into the sea, has 34,084 inhab. and numerous
palaces, including the Pal. Spinola and the Pal. Scam (formerly

tiful garden. The church of Santa Maria delta Celia contains {res-z
cues of the Genoese school. Large sugar-reﬁnery.
