prominent. A good bridle-path ascends from Courmsyeur, by La Sam
(1:. 56) end Villair, to the (2 hrs.) Chalets du PM (64% ft.) and the (1 hr.)
summit. The descent may he made by the Chalet; du Leuchi (6295 it.) into
the Val Ferret. — Excursions in the Mont Blenc chain, to Chumonix, etc.,

13. From Aosta to the Grain Alps.

The Guns)! Arms, an extensive mountain-system culminating in the
Gran Paradiso (13,324 it.) and the Grivola (13,022 it), lie between the
valleys of the Dam Baum and the Isére on the N.. and those of the
Born Riparia end the Arc on the S. We here describe a few of the most
interesting routes through the E. part of this grnnd mountain-region,
in the form of a circular tour of four days from Aorta, taking in Cognz,
Valaaoarauche, Rhs‘mu Nola-Dame, Valgruanche, end Liver-09M. Cogne is
the best centre for excursions.

The mountains of Cogne formed a favourite chaste of King Humbert,
Is they did of his father Victor Emmanuel (p. 53), and the mountain
goat (‘Steinbock‘, Ital. ‘stamhecco‘, Fr. ‘bouquetin’), elsewhere nearly
extinct, is still found here. Several excellent bridle-paths, leading to the
royal shooting-lodges, are a. great assistunce to the pedestrian.

ist Day. — Fron Aosn To Coons (61/, hrs.). As far as (6 M.)
Aymaville (2120 ft.) we may follow the highroad (p. 55), but it is
preferable to cross the Dore near Aosta, and to go by Grcuan and Jo-
vmcan, across meadows and ﬁelds. The bridle-path then ascends
rapidly past the church of St. Martin to Poia (2790 ft.), and enters
the monotonous,Val de Gogne at a great height above the ravine of
the brawling Grand’ Eyuie. Fer below we soon observe the houses
of Pont d’Ael (2865 ft.), with its admirably preserved "Roman
Bridge (formerly an aqueduct), 60 yds. long and 390 ft. above the
stream. It was erected in the reign of Augustus. The valley con-
trscts. Near the bridge by which we cross the stream we obtain a
View of the Grivola for a short time. We next reach (11/2 hr.)
Viéyes (3714 ft.; cantine), at the mouth of the C'ombe dc Nomenon
(pretty waterfall), with the Grivola and the Gran Nomenon
(11,440 ft.) in the background. Beyond (1/4 hr.) Silvenoire (right)
end a deserted iron-foundry we again cross the brook by the Pont
dc Laval 4480 it), where the mountains of Cogne are revealed,
to (11/; hr. Eyiml (4760 ft.), opposite the lofty Punta del Pousset
(see below) and the Trajo Glacier. At (‘/2 hr.) Crétaz the Val-
nonley descends from the S. to the Grand’ Eyvie; (20 min.) Cogne.

with a beautiful view of the Gran Paradise and the Tour du Grand
St. Pierre, with their glaciers (Glacier de la Tribulation, du Grand
Cron, du Money, etc.) to the S., and of the Mont Blanc to the N.W.,
is m excellent starting-point for excursions. Three valleys converge
here: the Vallone di Valnontey from the 8., the Valtone d‘Urtier
from the S.E., and the Vallone di Grausan from the NE.
