Padua (40 ft.), Ital. Padded, Lat. Patavium, the capital of I
province and see of a bishop, with 81,142 inhab., lies on the Bac-
chigliom, which ﬂows through it in several branches. Its tortuous
streets are generally ﬂanked with low and narrow ‘Portici’ or ar-
cades, but some of the chief thoroughfares have been widened by
the removal of the portici. The outer quarters consist largely of
gardens. Some of the numerous bridges over the different arms of
the river date from the Roman period. Excellent drinking-water is
brought from the neighbourhood ofDueville, in the Eugsnean Hills.

Padua traces its origin to Anterior, the mythical King of Troy, brother
of Prism, and under Augustus was the wealthiest town in Upper Italy:-
All the ancient monuments were afterwards destroyed during the immi-
gration of the barbarian hordes. In the middle ages the town sided with
the Guclphs, and in 1318 it appointed Jacopo da Carrara to the Signona‘
The princes of this family were much harrassed by the Scalas of Verona
and the republic of Venice and at length succumbed in “(15, when PM”
was annexed to Venetia. ’I‘he University, founded by Bishop Giordano in
1222, and extended by Emp. Frederick 11. in 1238, rendered Padua a very
famous seat of learning throughout the middle ages.

In the lirs'ronr or An'r Padua is also an important place, its reputa-
tion as the chief seat of Italian learning having attracted many artists. The
Florentine masters Giotto, Paolo Uccello, ha Filippo Lippi, and Donate!“
