by the Venetian ofﬁcials (see his ‘Italienische Beise’). The parish—
church contains a Descent from the Gross by Girolamo dai Libri, a
richly coloured masterpiece (ist altar on the right). Beautiful road
hence to (16 M.) Garda (see below).

Beyond Malcesine lie two rocky islets, Iaola dell’ Olive and
Trimelone. The next stations are Assenw, Magugnano, Caslelktto
diBrmzone (P; Alb. del Sole), and Tom" del Bcnaco (P; Alb. Cal-
rinardi), with an imposing mined castle and large quarries of yellow
marble. The stretch between Torri and Garda is the most beautiful
part of the E. bank. The banks become ﬂatter. The promontory of
'San Vigilio (osteria) with the neglected Villa Brensoni, 21/4 M. to
the W. of Gerda, extends far into the lake. In the beautiful Bay
of Gerda, sheltered from the N. by Monte Baldo, lie the villas of
Marchese Oarlotti and Count Albertini of Verona, both with ﬁne
parks, with pine-trees. The picturesque old town of Gerda (P;
rm. Gerda; H6t.-Pma. Sim Vigilio), at the inﬂux of the Techno,
which descends from Monte Baldo, gives the lake its name.
