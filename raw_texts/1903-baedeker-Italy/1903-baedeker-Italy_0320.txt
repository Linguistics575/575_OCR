The original town was wrested by the Romans from the Gallic Ceno-
mani and colonised by them at the beginning of the second Punic war
(8.0. 218). It became one of the most ﬂourishing towns in E. Italy, bui
in 70 A.D., during the civil wars, it was reduced to ruins by the Emp.
Vespasian, who, however, afterwards restored it. ‘Bellas externis intact:
civilibus lnfelix‘ is the summary of its history by Tacitus. The Goths and
Lombards, especially King Agilulf, as well as the subsequent conﬂicts
between Guelphs and Ghibellines, did great damage to the town. Cremona
espoused the cause of Frederick Barbarossa against Milan and Creme, and
subsequently came into the possession of the Visconti and of Francesco
Sforsa (p. 111), after which it belonged to Milan. On 1st Feb., 1702,_Prince
Eugene surprised the French marshal Villeroi here and took him prisoner.
In 1799 the Austrians defeated the French here.

to have belonged to the circle of Giov. Bellini (p. 268), in Venice, is gen-

frescoes of his assistants Altobslla Melons and Gian Franc. Bembo show the
inﬂuence of Romsnino (p. 1J0) and Pordenone (p. 268), who worked side
by side with them in the cathedral. The traditions of Boccaceino were
continued by his son, Camilla Baccaccino, and by Galeazza Campt (d. 1“]-
The younger Campi, Giulia and Antonio. were mainly subject to the MS
of Giulio Romano. Cremons. was the birthplace of Sofam'sba d‘Angm’m’W
(1535-1626), who, like her five sisters, practised the art of painting. and
was highly esteemed by her contemporaries. She afterwards retiredto
Genoa, and even in her old age attracted the admiration of Van Dyck.
