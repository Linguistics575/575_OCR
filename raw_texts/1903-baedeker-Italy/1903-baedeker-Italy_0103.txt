This district ‘at the foot of the mountains‘, enclosed on three sides
by the Alps and Apennines, and separated from Lombardy by the Ticino,
embraces, according to the present division, the provinces of Turin, No-
mm, Cause, and Alessandrz‘a, with 3,233,000 inhab., and an area of about
11.1“) sq. M. It consists of lowlands ﬂanking the banks of the Po and its
tributaries, which yield rice, wheat, and maize, and of highlands where ex-
cellent wine and silk are produced, and lastly of a bleaker mountain
rtgion of forests and pastures. The earliest Ixusnrnnrs were Celtic and
leian tribes, who were but slowly inﬂuenced by Roman culture; and
“was not till the reign of Augustus that the subjugation of the higher
Valleys was completed. The DIALECT of the people still retains traces of
lhail" ancient afﬁnity with the French, thus, pielwe, instead of the Italian
prom-e, om for name, chew for were, sild for cittd, rason for regions,
Piaua for piaua. This patois is universally spoken, even by the upper
times, but is unintelligible to strangers. Throughout Piedmont, however,
French is very generally understood.
