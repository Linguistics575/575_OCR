and the see of a bishop, lies 1/3 M. from the S. bank of the Po,
which is crossed by a bridge—of—boats and “railway—bridge. The
town possesses several interesting churches (closed 12-3).

Piacenza was founded by the Romans, 8.0. 219, as Colonial Hamlin,
in a position commending one of the passages of the Po, which lent it
importance as a fortress against the Gauls. Cremona (p. 189) was founded
at the same time. In the middle ages Piacenze held n high rank in the
league of the Lombard towns, and was ntterwards frequently the subject
of ﬁerce party-struggles between the Scotti, Torriani, and Viaconti. In
1488 it was plundered b Francesco Sforza, a blow from which it never
entirely recovered. In 547 it ﬁnally came into the possession of the
Fumese family and was united to Perms.
