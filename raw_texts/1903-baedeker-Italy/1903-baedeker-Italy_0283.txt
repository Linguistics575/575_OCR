The Val Tallinn, which is watered by the Adda and traversed by a
railway and a road, belonged to the Grisons down to 1791, then to Austria.
and since 1859 has been united to Italy. The inundations ot the river
often cause lasting damage by scattering debris from its broad gravelly
channel and make the lower part of the valley marshy and unhealthy.
An aromatic red wine is yielded by the vines on the slopes of the valley.
