Genoa, Italian Genﬁva, French Génes, with 219,500 inhah. , the
seat of a university and of an archbishop, end the headquarters of
the 4th Italian army corps, is a strong fortress and the chief com-
mercial town in Italy. Its situation, rising above the sea in a wide
semicircle, and its numerous palaces justly entitle it to the epithet
of ‘La Superba'. The old town is a net-work of narrow and steep
streets, lined with many-storied buildings, but the newer quarters
have broad and straight thoroughfares. Since the 17th cent. Genoa
has been protected on the landward side by a rampart, over 9 M.
long, which extends from the large lighthouse on the W. side (1). 82),
where the barracks of San Benigno afford quarters for 10,000 men,
past the Forte Begato (1620 ft.), to the Forte dcllo Speronc (1690 ft.);
then descends past Forte Castellaccio (1250 it; view) into the valley
of the Bisagno, on the E. The heights around the town are crowned
with ten detached forts.

The beauty of its situation and the reminiscences of its ancient
glory render a visit to Genoa very attractive. Invalids, however,
must be on their guard in winter against the raw winds and the
abrupt changes of temperature.

From the earliest times Genoa has been famous as a seaport, and i'
is believed to derive its name from the fact that the shape of the cons
here resembles that of a knee (germ). The Roman form of its municipa
government was maintained throughout the period of the barbarian in
vasions, when a Frankish feuds] nobility sprang up alongside of the nativ‘
noblesse. The smaller towns on the Ligurian coast looked up to Geno:
as their champion against the Saracens, who ravaged the cuuntr fron
Fressineto (Fraxinet), and in 936 even plundered Genoa itself. In 119-35
the Genoese waged war with varying sucCess against Pisa, which threateneu
its maritime commerce from the settlements on Corsica and Sardinia. 11
the following century the rival cities were almost permanently at W3
down to 1281i, when the power of Pisa was shattered for ever in (h
terrible naval battle at Meloria (p. 405). At a still earlier period Geno;
had participated in the Crusades, and secured to herself a busy trade Wit-
the Levant. She also possessed settlements at Constantinople, in Syn
and Cyprus, at Tunis and Majorca. The consequent rivalry of the Genoea
and Venetian: was a fruitful source of wars and feuds, which were nC
ended until the defeat of Genoa at the battle of Chioggia in 1380.
