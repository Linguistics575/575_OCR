of 126 steps (lift, 60 c.) to the ”Galleria degli urn-i (admission,
see p. 437). The gallery originated with the Medici collections, to
which numerous additions have been made down to the most recent
times, and it is now one of the greatest in the world, both in extent
and value. Many of the best pictures are often removed from their
usual position for the convenience of copyists, but their whereabouts
is indicated by a notice on the vacant space. A systematic re-
arrangement is contemplated. Catalogue, in Italian, French, or
English, 3 fr. Director, Signor E. Ridolﬁ.

The pictures in the Tribuna (p. 461) I“. the choicest in the
gallery, as their position indicates, and are therefore all worthy
of careful inspection. These are, however, by no means the only
treasures o! the collection. Thus the predelle and the angels at the
sides of Fm Angelico‘s frequently copied winged picture of the Ma-
donna and angels (No. 1294; p. 468) are more interesting than the
principal picture itself. Among the other FLonnrrmn works of the
15th cent. we may ﬁrst mention Fm Filippo Lippi'a Madonna with
angels (1307; p. 464), and four works of Sandra Botticelli: a round
picture of the Madonna (1267 his; p. 464), the Adoration of the Magi
[1286; p. 468), so much extolled by Vaeari, and, as specimens of
other subjects, his Birth of Venus (39; p. 468), and his Calumny after
Apelles (1182; p. 464). Filippino Lippi": Madonna and saints (1268;
p. 464) attracts attention by its size and clear colouring, and his
\doratiou of the Magi (1267; p. 464), with its numerous ﬁgures, is
nteresting on account of the portraits it contains. One of the best of
he early masters was Domenico Ghirlandajo, whose beautiful round
)icture of the Adoration of the Magi (1296; p. 465), and the Ma-
lonna with saints (1297; p. 468), are remarkable for the excel-
ence of the composition and the harmony of colouring. The full im-
portance of this master, who excelled in narrative painting, can only
is perceived, however, in the domain of fresco-painting (pp. 502,
306, 507). The mythological works of Piera di Cosimo (i312;
?- 464, etc.) betray a taste for fantastic subjects, from which Leon.
la Vinci himself was not entirely free. Pietro Perugino, Raphael's
eacher , is here well represented only by his brilliant portraits
:1217; p. 463). The portrait of Raphael by himself (288; p. 458) is
genuine, though disﬁgured by retouching. Other paintings by this
uaster form the chief gems of the Tribune (p. 462). A very effective
picture, notwithstanding its unﬁnished condition, is Leon. da Vinci’a
'ich composition of the Adoration of the Magi (1252; p. 464).
smother very important work, though unﬁnished, is Era Bariolomco’s
ﬂadonna enthroned 1265; p. 464), with its masterly grouping. The
Visitation of Mary ( 259; p. 464), by Marietta Albertinclli, an as-
.istant of Fra Bartolomeo, and Sodoma’s St. Sebastian (1279, p. 464)
tlso rank among the ﬁnest creations of Italian art. —- Among the
works 0! the other Italian Schools the most notable are Mantcyna’s
dadonna among the rocks (1025; p. 465), and among the numerous
