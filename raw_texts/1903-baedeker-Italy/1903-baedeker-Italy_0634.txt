whose immediate successors were Perellino (1422-57), Aleut'o Baldon'mui
(1427-99). and the brothers Antonio and Pt‘ero Pollajuolo (1429-98 and MB-
ca. 1496). The chief aims of the school were to master the technical
intricacies of the art, to invest each ﬁgure with beauty, to arrange the
groups harmoniously, and to cultivate a. faithful portraiture of real life.

Leonardo da Vinoi, Michael Angelo Buonarroti, and Raphael, the princes of
Italian art, is not permanently associated with Florence, but their residence
in this city exercised a material inﬂuence on their respective careers.
Leonardo and Michael Angelo, both Tuscans, may be regarded as belonging
to Florence owing to the completion of their studies there, and it was It
Florence that Raphael supplemented his art education and shook of the
trammels of the Umbrian school. About 1506 the art history of Florence
attained its most glorious period. Leonardo, Michael Angelo, and Raphael
were then engaged here together, and with them were associated Lorem
dr‘ Credi (145mm), a master closely allied to Leonardo, the fanciful
Hero (13' Cosimo (1462-1521), Fm Bartolomeo (1475-1517), an intimate friend
of Raphael, and the talented colourist Andrea del Sarto (1487-1531), while
the last two were riValled by Albertinelli, E'anciabigio, and Pontormo.
Ridolfo Ghi'rlandnjo follows the steps of Leonardo and Raphael, at least
in his ortraits. The union of the greatest masters at Rome, eﬂ‘ected by
Julius l. and Leo X., at length detracted from the reputation of Florence,
and, the despotic sway of the Medici tended to check farther development
After the 16th cent. Florence produced no architecture worthy of note:
and the provinces of painting and sculpture, although cultivated with
more success, now proved destitute of depth and independence. Florence
was the chief headquarters of the mannerist imitators of Michael Angelo.
the most eminent of whom were Giorgio Vasart‘, the well-known biographer
of artists (1511-74), Angelo Bronzino, and Alessandro Allorl'. Among sculp-
tors may be mentioned Benmmlo Cell-ind (1500-1572), also eminent u I

artists were Lodooica Cardi, surnamed Olgalt‘ (1559-1613), Cristofano Allan
(1577-1621), Framaco Furim‘ (ca. 1600-46), and the insipidly sweet Carl:

Florence was originally situated wholly on the right bank of the
Arno, but it extended at an early period in the middle ages to the
opposite bank also. The walls of the city, which have been almost
entirely removed since 1865, were constructed at the same time as
the cathedral, between 1285 and 1388. The ancient Gyms, however.
nearly all altered or added to in 1529, have been spared. The follow-
in are the most interesting: Porto alla Croce (Pl. 1, 6), erected in
1 , with frescoes by Ghirlandajo; Porto San Gallo (Pl. H, I, i),
erected in 1330; Porta Sari Frediano (Pl. B, 4), erected in 1332 by
Andrea Pisano U); Porta Romano (Pi. A, 7), erected in 1328 by
J acopo Orcagna; andPorta San Miniato (Pl. F, 8). The NEW Quursns
of the town are at the W. end, on the right bank of the Arno, extend-
ing as far as the Csscine (p. 524), and also to the N. and E. of the Ports
San Gallo, and to the E. of the old town. The broad Viali di Circan-
callan'one encircle the town on the right bank under various names
and occupy the site of the old fortiﬁcations. Since 1888 the narrow
and quaint streets in the Centre, the quarter bounded by the Via
