San Petronio were executed by Jaeopo delta Garcia (1874-1438) of Biena,
one of the founders of Renaissance sculpture. A litle later the most pro-
minent sculptors were Southern Italians: Niccolo dell‘ Area ((1. 1494), of Earl,
and Vinson 0M . Michael Angelo worked here more than ones. In 1494,
when a fugitive rom Florence shortly before the banishment of the Medici,
he found occupation in the church of 8. Domenico; and in 153-8 he
executed the bronze statue of Pope Julius II. for the facade of S. Petronio
(p. 366). Of the other Renaissance masters, who are well represented at
Bologna, Alfonso Lombardi, or properly Oiuadeua of Lueca (1488—1637),
holds the highest rank; he was the son of a. native of Lneca who emigrated
to Ferraro in 1496. Bologna was also the birthplace of Proper ds‘Raud
(1490-1530), one of the few women who have devoted themselves to sculpture.

1n the province of Pamrmo we are struck by Bologna‘s close connec-
tion with the School of Ferrara, due robably to the dearth of impor-
tant native masters (comp. p. 356). The rst Bolognese master who attained
more than a local reputation was Francesco Francta (1450-1517), the gold-
smith, who owed much to Lorenzo Costa of Ferrara. In the devotion and.
gracefnlness of his female figures he almost rivals Perugino, as well as in
his portraits. Francis, like Costa, must be judged by his easel-paintings
(in 8. Giacomo Maggiore, 8. Giovanni in Monte, Pinscotcca), not by his
frescoes, in which both are far inferior to their Florentine contemporaries.
Timotso Vils‘, a. upil of Francia, is mentioned at Urbino as Raphael‘s
ﬁrst master. W th Franceseo‘s son Giacomo Francia, for a time inﬂuenced
by the Venetian school, begins a period of decline, which was not arrested
Even by Ra hsel‘s inﬂuence, re resented in Bologna by Bartel. Ramenghi,
mrnamed agnacaoallo (d. 1 ), and Innocmo da Imdla (1494-1549).
Bologna attained its greatest importance at the close of the 16th century.
Fhe mannerism into which Italian painting had gradually lapsed was
'esisted by the Eurasian, whose style was mainly introduced by Lo-
iom'ca Can-acct (1566-1619). In teaching at his academy he inculcated a
thorough mastery of the elements of art, a comprehensive education, and
”awful study of the great masters. The school was afterwards carried
m by his cousins Agostino (1558-1601) and Anmbale Garracci (1560-1609),
be last of whom in particular possessed a reﬁned sense of colour, devel-
lPBd bé the study of Oorreggio. To this school belonged also Guido Rsnd'
1574—1 2), Domichtno (Domenico Zampieri; 1581-1641), Alessandro ﬂartnt
1577-1688), Gust-aim (p. 354), and Franc. Album (1578-1660), who exercised a
{feat inﬂuence on Italian art in the 17th cent., and eﬂected a temporary revi-
'sl of good taste. They afterwards came into collision with the naturalists,
:hietly at Rome and Naples, but at Bologna their sway was undisputed.

The centre of the town is occupied by the 'Prazzs Vrr'ronio
gunman (Pl. E, 4, 6 , formerly Piazza Maggiorc, and the Pnzza
m. Nam-one (Pl. E, 4 , which lie at right angles to one another
Lnd together form one of the most interesting town-squares in Italy.

Emmanuel 11., in bronze, by Monteverds, erected in 1888. The king
