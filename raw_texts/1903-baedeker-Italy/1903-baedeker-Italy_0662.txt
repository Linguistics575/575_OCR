Quitting the Piazza della Signoria (p. 445), we follow the Via
de’ Gondi to the right, which leads us to the PIAZZA Sax Fmrmzs
(Pl. F, 5), with the church of that name. No. 1, on the W. side
of this Piazza, is the Palauo Gondi, begun about 1490 by Giuliano
da Sangallo, and remodelled in 1874 by Poggi, with a rustica facade
tapering towards the top and a handsome court. In one of the rooms
on the ﬁrst floor is a marble chimney-piece, with a relief by G. da
Sangello.

Immediately on the right in the VIA DBL Paocoxsoao (Pl. F, 5),
which leads hence to the N. to the Piazza del Duomo, rises (No. ‘2)
the Palazzo dcl Pedesta, commonly known as '11 Bargello (Pl. F, 5),
begun in 1255 for the Capitano del Popolo(p.440), and from 12610)
the residence of the Podcsta, or chief magistrate of Florence. The
building was repeatedly damaged by riots, ﬁre (1382), and water
(1333) during the 14th century. From 1574 it served as a prison and
seat of the head of the police (Bargello). The oldest part of the
building, towards the Via Proconsolo, is of ashlar, the upper story
(added after 1332) and the extension towards the E. are of rough,
unhewn stone. Between 1867 and 1865 the imposing structure
was judiciously restored by Franc. Mami and ﬁtted up for the
”National Museum (Museo Naaionale), illustrative of the medieval
and modern history of Italian culture and art. It contains several
admirable Renaissance bronzes and marbles (comp. p. l). Admis-

colonnades and ﬁne ﬂight of steps (built in 1345-67) a digniﬁed
