0. From the Piano. dol Duomo to the Piana San Marco and
Piano. dell’ Indipendenn. by the Via. cavour.

The Vra nn’ Manmmr (Pl. F, 4), beginning at the Baptistery,
and its continuation, the wide VIA Cavoon (Pl. F-H, 3, 2; formerly
Via Largo), together form the most important thoroughfare in the
N. part of the city.

At the comer of the Via de’ Marielli and the Via de’ Gori rises
the church of San Giovannino degli Boolepi (i.e. of the Padri delle
Scuole Pie; Pl. F, 4), erected in 1352, remodelled after 1579 by
B. Ammanati, completed in 1661 by Alfonso Partgi, and in the pos-
session of the Jesuits from 1557 to 1775. The church contains pic-
tures by Allori, Franc. Currado, etc.

Opposite, to the right, at the beginning of the Via Cavour, is
the Palazzo Panciétichi (Pl. F, 4), built about 1700 by Carlo Fontana,
with a relief of the Madonna by Desiderio da Settignano at the comer.

The adjoining building on the left, which has been in possess-
ion of the government since 1814 and is now occupied by the
prefecture, is the old palace of the Medici, generally called
after its later owners the ‘Palano Riccardi (P1. F, 3, 4). It was
erected about 1435 under Cosimo Pater Patriaa by Michelozzo, who
here introduced the practice of tapering the rustica in the diii'erent
stories. The unsymmetrical heads is surmounted by a rich and
heavy cornice. Here Coaimo‘s grandson Lorenzo i1 Magniﬂco was
born on Jan. 1st, 1449, and here he maintained his brilliant estab-
lishment. Lorenzo’s sons Piero, Giovanni, and Giuliano also ﬁrst
saw the light within its walls. Giulio, Ippolito, Alessandro, and
Cosimo I. de’ Medici (the last till 1540; comp. pp. 445. 510)
subsequently resided here, and the family continued in possession
of the palace until it was sold in 1659 by the Grand—Duke Ferdi-
nand II. to the Riccardi family, who extended it considerably to the
N. in 1714, enclosing within its precincts the Strada del Traditore,
where Duke Alessandro was assassinated by Lorenzino de’ Medici
