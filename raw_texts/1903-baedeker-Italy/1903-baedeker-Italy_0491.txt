The Emilia includes the former dnchies of Puma and Modems, as well
as the papal Romugna, and is now divided into the eight provinces of
Pt‘acenra, Parma, Rewio, Mariana, Bologna, Fen-arc, Racmma, and Forli,
covering an area of 782) sq. M., with a population 012,198,500 souls. The
dialects spoken here form the third main group of the Gallic languages
of Upper Italy, and the nasal sound of the vowels will at once strike the
traveller as indicating the original afﬁnity of the people with the French.
The Celts seem to have crossed the Alps in several diﬂ'erent detachments.
After the Imbn‘ had conquered the district of Milan, and the Cmmnant
Brescia and Verona, the tribe of the Bm'i crossed the Po about 40013.0,
and subjugated the Etruscans and Umbrians who were settled to the S.
of that river. They chose Bologna for their capital, in the name of which
is still preserved that of the con usrors. The Serums next invaded Italy,
and took possession of the coast- istrict to the S. of the Boil, extending
nearly to Ancona. It was a horde of these Gauls that destroyed Rome in
B.C. 889. About a century later Italy, united under the guidance of Rome,
began to reconquer the lost territory. In 283 the Senones were exter-
minated. In 269 a colony was established at Art'nu'num, which was con-
stituted the strongest frontier-fortress in the peninsula, and connected
with Rome by the Via Flaminia. In 224 the Boil were subjugated, and
in planting the colonies of Placsnﬁa and Cremona in 219, Rome extended
her frontier as far as the Po. This process of Latinisation was interrupted
by the invasion of Hannibal, but vigorously resumed after his defeat; and
in 189 Bologna, and in 135 Madeira and Pam received Roman colonies.
