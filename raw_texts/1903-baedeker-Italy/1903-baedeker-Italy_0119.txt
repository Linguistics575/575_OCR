Albertoni, Dr. L. Gallo (d. 1857), by Vela, and Prof. Timer-mans
(d. 1875), by Tebscchi; and of Pescatore, the jurist, by Dini. The
University Library, now the Biblioteca Nazionale (adm., see p. 26),
was founded in 1720 by Vittorio Amadeo II.

' The nucleus of the collection, which numbers over 250,030 printed
vols. and 4138 1158., consists of the former library of the house of Savoy
and some valuable MSS. from Bobhio (p. 336). There are numerous Oriental
1155., about 400 Greek MSS. (including Theodoret’s Commentary on the
llinor Prophets, with Byzantine miniatures; 9th cent), and 1200 Latin 3155.,
including palimpsests of Cicero and Cassiodorus, the Theodosian codex,
two Irish 115$. 01‘ the 7th cent.. and Pliny‘s Histotia Naturalis, with
miniatures of the school of Mantegna. —- Among the 1095 incunahula is
the Rationale of Guglielmo Duranti. printed by Fast at Mayence in 1459.
The library contains also many Aldine editions and a copy of the great
Bible of Plantin, presented by Philip H. of Spain to Charles Emmanuel.
Some old playing-cards (15th cent.), Fr. Basso‘s map of the world (1570),
and about 10,0“) woodcuts and engravings of various schools are also
among the treasures of the library.

No. 6, to the right in the Via Acoademia Albertina, is the
Aecademia Albertina di Belle Arti (Pl. E, F, 3; adm., see p. 26),
founded in 1652, and transferred hither in 1833. It contains a
small collection of pictures. Among the best of the older works
(many copies) are: 126. Quinton Matsys Ct), Head of Christ; 140,
141. FM. Filippo Lippi, Four Fathers of the Church (wings of altar-
piece). Also numerous *Cartoons by Gaudenzio Ferrari and Bern.
Lam'm', and a cartoon of Leon. da Vinci’s St. Anna with the Yirgln
and Holy Child (not genuine).

The Via Montebello, the next cross-street, leads to the so-called
Hole Antonelliana (Pl. F, 3: 3.qu see p. 27), begun in 1863
as a synagogue by Al. Antoneui (d. 1888) and completed by the city
in 1878-89. It will be ﬁtted up as a Museo del Risorgimmto (comp.
p. 36). It is a square building (44 yds. each way) resembling a
tower, with a singular facade formed of several rows of columns;
its height to the head of the copper statue ( 13 ft. high) at the top
is 538 ft. (Washington Obelisk 555 ft). The dome is striking from
its bold disregard of the ordinary technical rules of construction.
The hall beneath the dome is 84 ft. square and upwards of 300 ft.
high, and contains three galleries one above the other. The upper-
most gallery commands a splendid *View of the city and the Alps,
best by morning light. (Comp. the Panorama, p. 38.)

The rominent heights are: to the N., the snowy peaks of Monte
Rosa (15, 5 it); to the N.W., the Gran Paradiso (13,324 t't.), more to the W.
is the Rocclamelone 01,604 ft.), concealing Mt. Cenis; then, to the left, the

valley of Susa (p. 4:), with the Sagra di San Michele (p. 3) on a conspicuous
hill; farther to the S.W. Monte Viso (12,670 ft.).

In the Via di Gaudenzio Ferrari, No. 1, is the Museo Civico or
lunicipale d’Arte Antics. (P1. F, 3; adm., see p. 27).
