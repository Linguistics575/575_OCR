are of unquestioned authenticity, though they display neither the
independence of conception nor the ﬁnished mastery of his later
Roman portraits. The ‘Gravida’ (229; see below) is not free from
doubt. — The Venetian School also occupies an important place
in the Pitti Gallery. Thus Giorgione‘s Concert (185; p. 513); Seb-
astian del Piombo‘a St. Agatha (179; p. 513); Tilian’a portraits
of Cardinal Ippolito de’ Medici (201; p. 513), Aretino (54; p. 516).
and the Young Englishman (92; p. 515), his Bella (18; p. 515),
and his Mary Magdalen (67; p. 515); Tintorctto'a Vulcan with
Venus and Cupid (3; p. 516). An excellent work of a later
period is Cristofano Allori’s Judith (96; p. 515). -— Among the
non-Italian pictures we must mention two landscapes (9, 14;
p. 516), four portraits (85; p. 515), and the Allegory of War (86;
p. 515), by Rubens,- Cardinal Bentivoglio (82; p. 515), by Van
Dyck; two portraits (16, 60; pp. 515,516) by Rembrandt,- and lastly
the equestrian portrait of Philip IV. (243; p. 516), by Velazquea

The ENTRANCE (comp. p. 437) is in the E. angle of the Piazza
Pitti, in the archway leading to the Boboli Garden. (Or we may
approach the gallery by the connecting passage from the 1mm;
sticks and umbrellas, see p. 437).

Tickets are obtained in the vestibule, to the right. The Scale
dd Re, a new staircase in pietra serene, constructed by Luigi del
More in 1895-96 in the style of Brunelleschi, leads to a large ante-
chamber, with a richly coﬂ’ered ceiling and a marble fountain of
the Renaissance, by Franc. di Simone (?), from the Villa Reale di
Castello (p. 525). The adjoining room, with the ingress from the
Uftizi, contains a large basin of porphyry.

The gallery extends through a suite of splendid saloons, richly
adorned in the baroque style by Pietro da. Cortomz (ca. 1600) and
embellished with allegorical ceiling-paintings whence their names
are derived. They are sumptuously ﬁtted up with marble and
mosaic tables and velvet-covered seats, but are very cold in winter.
The pictures are provided with the name of the artist and the sub—
ject represented. Catalogue (1897; in French), 2‘]; fr.

The six principal saloons are ﬁrst visited; the entrance was
formerly at the opposite extremity, so that the numbers of the
pictures, as enumerated below, are now in the reverse order. We
then return to the saloon of the Iliad , and enter the saloon
of the Education of Jupiter (p. 516), which adjoins it on the south.
In the following description, we begin in each case with the en-
trance-wall.

SALOON or THE ILIAD, so named from the subject of the (res-
coes by Luigi Sabatelli. It contains four tables of coloured marbles,
lapis lazuli, granite, and jasper, and four vases of black marble
(nero antico); in the centre a Caritas in marble by Lor. Bartoliei.
