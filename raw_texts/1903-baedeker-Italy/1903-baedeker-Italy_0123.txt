Environs. TURIN. 7. Roule. 39

Near the Monte dei Cappuccini, opposite the Ponte Vittorio
Emanuele Primo (see above), stands the large domed church of
hauled“ di Dio (PL G, 4), erected by Ferd. Bomignare in 1818-31
in imitation of the Pantheon at Rome, to commemorate the return
of King Victor Emmanuel I. in 1814. In front of the church rises a
lonument of Victor Emmanuel I. (d. 1824), by Gaggini. —— A few
hundred yards to the E. is the Villa delta Regina (Pl. H, 5), now a
school for the daughters of ofﬁcers who have fallen in battle.

The Cemetery (Campo Santa Generalc; Pl. G, H, 1), 11/4 M. to
the NE. of the Piazza Castello (open 10-4 in winter in ﬁne weather;

entered from the end of the Via Catania, which is reached from the
Ponte delle Benne by the Strada del Regio Parco, a shady avenue
(steam—tramway from the Piazza Emanuele Fillberto, p. 35). In the
front section, to the left by the wall, is the tomb of Silvio Pellico
(11.1854); in the section behind we observe the names of D’Azcglio,
BM, Brofferio, Giobcrti, Pepe, Pinelli, and other eminent Italians.

The ‘Snperga (2205 ft.), the royal burial-church since 1778,
umpicuously situated on a hill to the E. of Turin, is well worthy
g a visit. A steam—tramway plies from the Piazza Castello to the
