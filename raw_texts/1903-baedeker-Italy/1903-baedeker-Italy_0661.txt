The ﬁrst ﬂoor of the ediﬁce contains the Biblioteca Nazionale
Centrale (admission, see p. 437; entrance by the 8th door from the
piazza), which has been formed since 1860 by the union of the
grand-ducal Biblioieca Palatina and the still more extensive Biblio-
teca Magliabechiana. The latter, founded by Antonio Magliabechi
(d. 1714) a jeweller of Florence, has been dedicated to the use of
the public since 1747. The present library contains about 480,000
vols. and 18,500 MSS., and is regularly increased by the addition
of the most important works of the literature of other nations. There
are also several very rare impressions: the ﬁrst printed Homer
(Florence, 1488); Cicero ad Familiares (Venice, 1469); Dante, by
Landino (Florence, 1481, in a handsome binding adorned with niel-
10s); Piero Medici’s presentation copy of the Anthologia Grzeca ed.
Lascaris. -— The staircase to the right of the'librsry leads to the
CENTRAL ARCHIVES or Toscm (Archivio di State), occupying about
200 rooms and including about 200,000 single documents and
3-400,000 bound volumes. Director, Sign. P. Berti.
