Varenna. (.P &R; ‘Hét. Royal,-
AHJ. Vittoria, pens. 5-71/2 fr. ; Alb.
Olivedo) is charmingly situated
on a promontory surrounded by
gardens (lsimbardi, Lelia, Venini,
Kees), at the mouth of the Val
d’Esino. In the vicinity both road
and railway pass through several
tunnels. Most of the marble
quarried in the neighbourhood is
cut and polished in the town.

About 3/‘ M. to the S. of Va-
renna the Fiume Latte (‘milk
brook‘, from its colour) is precip-
itated in several leaps from a
height of 1000 ft., forming an im-
posing cascade in spring, but gen-
erally dried up at other seasons.

The ruins of Torre ds' Ven‘o beside
the high-lying hamlet of, Vezio
(1/, hr.) command a beautiful view.
— From Varenna a fatiguing foot-
path leads past Regaledo (p. 160)
and above the Orrtdo dt' Beltane to

The “lento Gris/nu. (7% ft.) is a
very ﬁne point. From Varenna a

Alpine chain from the Mtc. Viso
to the Ortler (the lite. Rosa group
particularly ﬁne), and of the plains
of Lombardy to the distant Apen-
nines. We may descend to the W.
