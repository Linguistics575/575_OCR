"SALOON or N10131:, constructed in 1775, and so named from
the twelve Roman copies of statues from the far-famed ancient
group of Niobe with her seven sons and seven daughters and their
pedagogue, who were slain by Apollo and Diana. In antiquity it
was a disputed point whether Scopes or Praxitclcs (4th cent. B.C.)
designed the group; but modern research has pretty well decided
the contest in favour of the former.

Eight of the statues were found at Rome outside the Ports. San Giovanni
in 1583 and placed by Cardinal Ferdinand de‘ Medici in his villa on the
Monte Pincio, whence they were transferred to Florence in 1771. Two of
the statues (Nos. 250, 247) were found elsewhere. Two of the youths are
each represented twice. The following have no connection with the Nio-
bidoe: to the right, 243. Apollo Githarccdus (restored as a woman); 21?.
