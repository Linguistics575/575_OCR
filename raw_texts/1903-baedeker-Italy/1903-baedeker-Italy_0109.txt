Turin (785 ft.), Ital. Torino, the ancient Taurasia, capital of
the Taurinl . s Ligurian-Celtic tribe, destroyed by Hannibal RC.
218, afterwards the Roman Augusta Taurfnorum, was the capital
of the County of Piedmont in the middle ages, and in 1418 became
subject to the Dukes of Savoy, who frequently resided here. From
i720 it was the capital of theAKingdom of Sardinia, and from 1859
to 1865 of ltaly. The seat of a university (founded in 1404), of
In archbishop, and of s military academy, and headquarters of the
lat Italian Corps d’Armée, this great city lies in an extensive plain
on the Po, which receives the waters of the Dora Riparin below
the city. The plain of the P0 is bounded on the W. by the Graian
and Cottian Alps , and on the E. by e range of hills rising on the
right bank, opposite the city (Monte dei Cappuccini, p. 39; Superga,
p. 39). Turin was the chief centre of those national struggles which
led to the uniﬁcation of Italy. The removal of the seat of government
to Florence seriously impaired the prosperity of the citizens for a.
time, but they have long since recovered their losses. The rapidly
increasing population new numbers upwards of 329,600, including
the suburbs.

_ Turin is conspicuous among the cities of Italy for the regularity of

Its construction. Its plan presents rectangular blocks of houses (Irate), long,

broad, straight streets ( Vie) , frequently with arcades (Portia), and spacious

"lunres. Its history explains this. The plan of the old town, with slight

VIristions, is the same as that of the colony founded by the Emperor

“mine, or even of an older Roman camp. It formed a rectangle of

2210 it. in length and 1370 ft. in breadth, and had eleven towers on

tub side. Its site is now bounded by the Piazza Costello on the E., the

Via dolls Consolnta and the Curse Siccsrdi on the W., the Via. Giulio on

flit N.. and the Via Santa. Teresa on the S. The ancient Via Decumrma

W. corner-tower, beside the Consolaln (p. ). In the 17th cent. a

Fillcmatic extension of the city was begun in accordance with the original

clan. The fortiﬁcations constructed by Francis 1. in 1536. and ﬁnally the

{“80 0f 17% cleared sway most of the old buildings and gave the town

i“ Preaent regular and modern appearance. The fortifications were demol-

ished by the French in 1801.
