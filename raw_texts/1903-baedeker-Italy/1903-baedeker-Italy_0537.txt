and important towns in Italy, the capital of the Emilia, and a strong
fortress, is situated in a fertile plain at the base of the Apennines,

I venerable and. celebrated university, whence the inscription on
old coins ‘Bononia docct’, and is the seat of an archbishop end the
headqusrters of the 6th army corps. The usually long and narrow

the venerable churches surmounted by quaint-looking towers, all
bear testimony to the peculiar character and at the same time to the
grasperlty of Bologna. The mean annual temperature is 2° Fahr.
