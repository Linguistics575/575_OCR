The Lnngarno Corsini ends at the PIAZZA n31. Pox'rn ALLA
Canaan. (Pl. 0, D, 4), whence the bridge mentioned at p. 445
spans the Arno, and the Via de' Fossi, with its numerous shops,
branches off on the N.E. to the Piazza Santa Maria Novella (p. 501 .
Opposite the bridge is a marble statue of Goldmi, the poet (1873
by Ulisse Cambi (1873). _

The continuation of the Lungarno is known as the LUNOARNO
Annnreo Vnsrncor after Amerigo Vespucci (1451-1512; see below),
the navigator, a native of this neighbourhood who gave his name
to America. -— Near the beginning of the Lungarno Amerigo Vespucci
expands the PIAZZA Mann: (P1. 0, 4), bounded on the N.E. by the
Bar-go Ognissanti, which runs parallel with the Lungamo, with a
bronze Statue of Daniele Martin (1). 267) by Urbano Nono (1890).

The suppressed Minorito monastery of Oynissanti ( now barracks)
on the E. side of the piazza was occupied from 1256 by members
of the Lombard order of Humiliati, who did much to improve the
woollen-manufacture. Beside it is the church of Ban Salvadore
d’Ognn‘ lanti (Pl. 0, 3), erected in 1554, remodelled in 1627, the

dclla Robbie, representing the Coronation of Mary.
