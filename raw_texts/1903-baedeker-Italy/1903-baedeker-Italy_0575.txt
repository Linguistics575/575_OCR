Tuscany which covers an area of 9287 sq. 11., and contains 23%,200
nheb., is divided into eight provinces of very diii'erent sizes; m'z. Kaua—
Tan-arc, 687 sq. M. in area, loané an independent dnchy and afterwards
mited with Modene down to i ; Lucas, 675 sq. M. in ares. nlso long
ndependent, but incorporated with the duchy of Par-ma from 1814 to 18W;
Plorence the lcrgest province, 2267 sq. M. in area; Leghorn, the smallest,
thout 12‘6 sq. H. in aresr and Hm, Arena, Storm, and Grousto. The
lensity of the population, too, varies greatly in different parts of the
xmntry. In the province of anca there are about 431 inhsb. to the square
nile, in Florence 296, in Siene 127, and in Grosseto not more than 57.
Nith the exception of‘the coast-districts and the valleys, the country is
tiny, end intersected by the spurs and nmiiications of the Sub-Apennirm.
[‘he N. part, adjoining the Arno, is most fertile, the plains and slopes of
he hills being richly cultivated. A strong contrast to this smiling region
5 presented by the marshy coast district below Leghorn, where malsriel
eVers have wielded their destructive swsy since the depopulation which
00k place in the middle ages. The soil of the inland hill country is also
Ioor, but some compensation is afforded for this by its copper and other
nines. Tuscany, indeed, possesses greater mineral wealth than any other
art of Italy, and to this circumstance is due the fact that it was earlier
.ivilised than the rest of the peninsula.

Tuscany still retains the name of its ﬁrst inhabitants, the Tusct' or
ilruser' (Greek hrs-Item‘s“). The excellent iron of Elba. and the rich
Opper mines of Volten-a afforded them materials (or establishing thriv-
ng industries, the products of which were in demand for and wide at an
