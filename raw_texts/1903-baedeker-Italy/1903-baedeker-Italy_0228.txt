History. The favourable situation of Milan in the centre of Lombardy,
near the beginning of several of the great Alpine passes, has always secured
for it a high degree of prosperity. Under the Romans, who conquered it
in B. 0. 2‘22, it was one of the largest cities in Italy, but owing to its
re eated destruction hardly a trace of that period has been left (p. 138).
Ager the decay of the Lombard sovereignty the power of the nrchbishops
(p.111) increased enormously, es ecially under Aribsrt (1018-45), against
whom the smaller vassals were orced to form a league, known as the
Malta. At a later date the people, grouped round the Carracdo, fought
for the Archbishops ainst Conrad II. and the noblesse, expelling the
latter from the city in 041. At this time Milan is said to have contained
5300,0000) inhab., and its trade and industry especially the weaving of
woollen goods and the making of arms and objects in gold, had become
very im ortant. The Roman walls had long since become too cramped,
and in 157 an almost circular moat, still preserved in the inner canal
(Naviglio), was constructed round the town. Neither this fortiﬁcation,
however, nor the heroic courage of the Milanese could resist the Emp.
Frederick Barbaroua, who, with the help of the Ghibelline towns of Lom-
bardy, totally destroyed the city in 11 2, with the exception of a few
churches. The emperor‘s severe rule. however, soon roused the whole of
Lombardy against him; five years later (I167) Milan was'rebuilt by the
allied cities of Brescia, Bergamo, Mantua, and Verona, while the battle
of Legnano (p. 165; 1176) ﬁnally shattered Barbarossa‘s hopes of re-estab-
lishing the empire of Charlemagne (comp. p. 111).

The Yawn“ (p. 111), who became ‘Slgnori‘ of Milan in 1277 and
furnished several occupants to the arehiepiscopsl chair, made an end of
the city‘s constitutional independence, but contributed to its well-being by
the introduction of the'silk-industry (ca. 1840) and by the wide extension
of their sway. A new outer rampart (the 12470310 or Rode/cue) was con-
structed in this period to protect the suburbs. The ﬁlm-ms (14504535)
endeavoured to reconcile the Milanese to their loss of liberty by the bril-
liancy of their court and their patronage of art.

The wars of the early part of the 16th cent. and the heavy taxes of
the Spanish Period did not prevent the growth of the city, which in 1590
numbered 248,000 inhabitants. In 1527 city-walls were erected on the
site of the outer ramparts, and in 1519 a new series of fortiﬁed and bastioned
walls were begun. In 1714 Milan, with the rest of Lombardy, passed into
the hands of Austria. In 1797 it became the capital of the ‘Oisalps‘m Re-
public‘, and then (down to 1815) that of the Kingdom of Italy. The bloody
insurrection of the “rogue (liar-nuts (March 17th-22nd, 1848) compelled the
Austrians to evacuate the city, and the patriotic agitations which ensued
were happily ended by the desired union with the new kingdom of Italy
in 1839. No town in Italy has undergone such marked improvement as
Milan since this date.

Art History. The only buildings of the early-Christian and Romanes ue
periods that survived the destruction of 1162 were the churches of an
orenzo (the oldest churCh in Milan), Sant‘ Ambrogio (the quaintest church
in Milan), San Simpliciano, San Sepolcro, San Celso, and Santa Babils.
The Gothic churches are more of decorative than constructive value;
some, like the cathedral, represent a not very successful compromise be-
tween the styles ot‘ the N. and of Italy, while others follow Venetian
models (the Frsri). °
