and their pupils, from the history of SS. Benedict, Cecilia, and Va-
lerian, unfortunately much injured. — A little below 8. Michele
lies the Villa Revedtn, which is open in the absence of the pro-
prietor; its grounds command charming views. T‘s road leading
straight on hence back to the town brings us in fﬁw minutes to a
pavilion, beside which is an entrance to the G1 im’ Maryberita
(p. 380).

About 11/‘ M. outside the Pon’rs SANT’ Issrs (Pl. A, 4), to the
W. of the town, is situated the Certoss. (formerly a Carthusian
monastery), erected in 1335, and consecrated in 1801 as a Campo
Santa. It occupies the site of an old Etruscan burial-ground, dis-
covered here in 1869. Open daily 8—6 (in winter 9-4). The en-
trance is in the N.W. corner; the custodian (ﬁrst court, to the left)
is well-informed 0/24 in). The Certosa may be reached by tram-
way (p. 362) or in 1/4 hr. from Meloncello (see below).

The church contains a few paintings by Elisabetta Hiram and Bart. cm,
and wood-carving of 1.639 and 611. — At the beginning of the Cnoxsrsns
are ancient tombstones from suppressed churches, arranged according to
centuries: at the entrance 13th cent. than 16th on the right. 14th farther
to the right, and 16th on the left. Then, modern monuments, including
ﬁgures of Faith by Gallant and Grief by Menard. In the centre are the
ordinary graves. Among many illustrious names on the former are those
of the philologist Gaspar Garatont (d. 1817) and Clonlda Tambroni (d. 1817;
p. 364). The principal families of the town also possess vaults here; thus
the monument of Letitia Marat Pepoli(18(B-59), with a statue of her father
King Murat (‘propuguatore dell‘ italics indipendenaa‘). executed by Vine.
Vela. A rotunda here contains the busts of celebrated professors; lesso—

On the Monte della Guardia, an eminence 3M. to the S.W. of
the Poms Ssnaoozzs (Pl. A, 6), rises the handsome pilgrimage
church of the Hedonna di Sui Luca (950 ft. ), erected by Dotti in 1732
et seq., and so called from an ancient picture of the Virgin, ascribed
to St. Luke and brought from Constantinople in 1160. The bill is
ascended in about 50 min. by a series of Arcades, consisting of
666 arches with numerous chapels, constructed in 1674-1739, and
21/2 M. in length. They begin a short way beyond the gate and
send a branch to the Campo Santa (see above). Steam—tramway
from the Piazza Malpighi to Meloncello at the foot of the hill (p. 362).
Thence the steps may be avoided by following the road along the
arcades. A better road (carriage with one horse 10 fr.) diverges to
the left into the valley of the Rio Raoone, 1/2 M. outside the Ports
Saragozza, and ascends in windings. At the (1 hr.) fork, the road to
San Luca diverges to the right, making a wide curve past Monte
Albano, and reaches the church in 3/; hr. more. The "View, partic-
