his younger brother Philip; in 1807 it was annexed to France, and in 1815
worded to Marie Louise, the wife of Napoleon I. In 1847, after her death ,
it came into the possession of the Bourbons, who had hitherto been in-
demniﬁed with Lucca. Charles II. (d.1883) was banished in 1848, Charles III.

drew slong with the Austrian garrison. The Duchy covered an arch of

Penna owes its importance in the Enron! or A31 to Antonio Allegrt
of Conway“ (1494-1634; p. 339), who, after his early studies in Ferrara,
lived here in a quiet and modest style, and died early. It was not till
ulster period, when he was followed by the Carracci, that his merits were
duly appreciated (characteristics, see p. 11). The best-known of his pupils
is Francesco Manolo, surnamed Parmigianino (1503-40), an excellent portrait
painter, and a native of Parma.

The ancient Via Emilia (p. 331) intersects the town, from the
Bam'em Vittorio Emanuele (Pl. G , 4) to the Barriera Massimo
d’Aseglio (Pl. A, 4), crossing the PIAZZA Gnmsnm (Pl. D, 4), in
which stand the Palauo del Govemo and the Palauo Municipale,
built after 1627 by Giov. Butt. Magnani. In front of the latter are
statues of Correggio, by Ferrarini (1870), and Garibaldi, by Gelandra
[1893). — A little to the N.E., in the Piazza del Duomo, rises the ~—

‘Oathedral (ll Duomo; Pl. E, 3), an admirable example of
the Lombard-Romanesque style, begun in 1058, but not completed
till the 13th century. It is e cruciform building covered with a
dome, with a somewhat raised choir above a crypt, and a broad facade
with a triple columnar gallery. The three portals are embellished
with two huge lions (executed in 1281 by 130710 da Bisone) and four
of smaller size, all of red marble, and sculptures by Lucchino
Bianchini (1493).

The Imnnron, consisting of nave and aisles, rests on fourteen piers
above which runs a ﬁne triforium. The vaulting of the nave was painted
by Giroiamo Murcia and by Lattansta Ganbara of Brescia (ca. 1570).

The octagonal Don: is adorned with an ‘Assumption b C'orrewio (1526-
30), unfortunately much injured by damp (best light a out noon). ‘It
seems as if some mighty upward impulse had impelled the whole armies
of Christendom to soar away from earth in joyful bliss. A striking feature
of the work is that the ﬁgures seem to cleave the vaulting and to be in
the act of forcing their way out of the church-walls into bright ether.
The masterly and almost playful manner in which the greatest difﬁculties
in the work have been overcome has ever been an object of the highest
admiration‘. — ‘Correygio‘, by Dr. Julius Meyer. Visitors may ascend into
the dome to examine the painting more closely (I/z-i fr.; fatiguing but
attractive); a ﬁne View is commanded from the outside gallery (for persons
free from dizziness).
