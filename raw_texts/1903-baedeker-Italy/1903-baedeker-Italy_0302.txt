on the W. bank, and Porto .Valtravaglia (3.; Ostm‘a Antiea) on
the E. In a wooded bay beyond the last lies Calde, with the an-
cient tower of the Costello di Calde on an eminence. To the S.
appears the green Sasso di Ferro (see below), and to the W. the
Monte Rosa and Simplon groups. Then, to the E., —

Laveno (R.; Pasta, at the E. end of the town, fair, 3.21/2, B. 11/4,
déj. or D. 21/2-3 in; Moro, near the quay, R. 2 fr., Italian, un-
pretending), situated at the foot of the Sasso di Farm, on a bay at
the month of the Boesia, formerly a fortiﬁed harbour for the Austrian
gun-boats. Laveno(‘20001nhah.) is adapted for a prolonged stay on
account of its beautiful situation and ample railway and steamer
facilities. The quay is close to the station of the Ferroeie Nerd,
while that of the Rate Mediterranea lies 1/2 M. farther on in the same
direction (0mm). A monument near the quay commemorates the
Garibaldians who fell in 1859. The site of Fort San Michele (to the
left as the steamer approaches) is now occupied by a pottery belong-
ing to the Societd Ceramica Italiuna. Above it is the Villa Pulll,
with a belvedere, which contains a few relics of 1859.

Behind Laveno rises the green Sal-o di Euro (3485 ft.), the most
beautiful mountain on the lake, easily ascended in 21/2-8 hrs. (red way-
marks), and commanding a magniﬁcent View of the lake, the plain as far
as Milan, and the Monte Rosa chain. —— About 7 hi. to the NE. of Laveno,
behind the $3,550 di Ferro, lies the hamlet of Varara (2625 ft.), whence
we may ascend the ‘Monte Nudo (A052 ft; 11/; hr.), perhaps the ﬁnest
view—point in the district, commanding an imposing survey of the Lago
Maggiore, the Lago di Lugano, the Lago di Varese, and the Valaisiau Alps.

bridge over the Boesio and a little short of the Mediterranean station (see
above), and thence by a picturesque footpath; or direct by boat (3 fr.)
from Laveno. Imbedded in the vaulted roof of the church is a rock,
which fell upon it in the 17th century. View of the Borromean Islands
and the snow mountains to the W.
