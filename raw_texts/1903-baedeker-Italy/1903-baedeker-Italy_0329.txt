distal Lowe degls' Alesumdrs‘ (d. at Avignon, 1319), by Ugo da Campione,

Vol: (1855). In the treasury (above the sacristy) are a large cruciﬁx (5 ft.

The adjoining ‘Cappelio. Colleoni (shown by the sagrestauo), erected
by 0. A. Amadeo in it. 0-76 in the early-Renaissance style, has a lavishly
sculptured facade, which. however. was probably much altered when the
interior was modernized in 1774. The interim- contains the tomb of the
founder Bart. Colleoni (d. “.75; p. 304), begun by 0. Ant. Amadea, with
reliefs from the life of Christ. 0n the tap is the gilded equestrian statue
of Colleoui by Sirius sin of Nuremberg (1501). To the ri ht is the
smaller, but beautiful monument of his daughter Medea (d. 1470), also
by Amadeo, and originally in the church of Basella. Above the altar on
the right are good sculptures; to the left, a Holy Family by Angelica
Kaufman's,- llne intarsia-work (covered); ceiling-paintings by Mole.

The adjoining Baptistery (Pl. 3; on the right), by Giov. da Cam-
pione (1340), originally in Santa Maria Maggiore,’ was re-erected
here in 1898. In the interior are reliefs of the Passion (key in the
sacristy of the cathedral; fee 30-50 c.).

Opposite is the Cathedral (P1. 13), built from designs by Vine.
Scamoszi in 1614 on the site of an earlier ediﬁce. First altar to the
left: Madonna and saints by G. B. Morom‘ (1576); behind the
high-altar, a 'Madonna, a late work of Gian. Bellini (1512; gen-
erally covered).

A little to the E. of the Piazza Garibaldi, in the Via. Colleoni,
is the Luogo Pie Colleom' (Pl. 4; C, 2), once the dwelling of Bart.
Goileoni, who bequeathed it to the city for an orphanage in 1466.
On the groundﬂoor are some frescoes by Purina da Nova and other
masters of the 15th cent; among them is an equestrian portrait of
Colleoni (fee of 1/3 fr. to the keeper).

We now return to the station of the cable-tramway and prooeed

thence, to the left, through the Strada Ports Dipinta, passing the
church of Sant’ Andrea, which contains a Madonna enthroned with
four saints, by Moreno (altar to the right; covered). Fine view.
The street leads to a small and hilly piazza with the church of San
Michele al Pom Bianca (Pl. 18, D ‘2; usually closed), which con-
tains good frescoes by Lor. Lotto, representing the Annunciation
and the Nativity and Marriage of the Virgin (chapel to the left of
the choir; partly concealed by the altar-piece). --— We may proceed
to the right through the Via Osmano to the ramparts (p. 194). or
continue to follow the Strada Ports Dipinta to the left to the Porta
Sant’ Agom'no Pl. D, 2), near which is the old Gothic church of
the same name now a barrack). —— Just below the gate a footpath,
lined with acacias, leads to the —
