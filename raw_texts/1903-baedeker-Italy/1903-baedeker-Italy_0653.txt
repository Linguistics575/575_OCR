”1139. Michael Angelo, Holy Family, on early work, painted on
the commission of Angelo Doni, the only easel-work of the master
in Italy, painted in tempera between 1501 and 1505.

The Madonna. 3 large-framed women, kneels on the ground and leans
to one side, as she hands the Infant over her shoulder to her husband,
who stands hehind and ﬁnishes ed the (rOup. In the hollow way of
the middle distance walks the sturdy little John the Bahptis who looks
merrily bnek at the domestic scene. Naked ﬁgures, w ch ave no ap-
parent connection with the subject of the picture, enliven the background,
in obedience to the custom of the 15th cent., when the artist was ex-
)ected to show his skill in perspective or his mastery of the nude on every
)pportunity. — Springer.

‘A magniﬁcent likeness, in which the true grain of what may be called
hurchman's ﬂesh is reproduced in a form both clear and fair but with the

'1141. A. Dilrer, Adoration of the Magi (1504), one of the ﬁrst
iportant easel-paintings by this master, carehilly and minutely
iished, and in good preservation.

Both the aérlal and the linear erspeetive are faulty, but the tech-
:el handling is as perfect as in iirer‘s latest and ﬁnest works. The
atment and the colouring are both in the characteristic style of the
rthern school of painting. The colours are ﬂuent but sharply deﬁned,
d on It ﬁrst a tempera and then glued with oil-pigments. The tone
extraordinarily lively and clear. — This gem of German art was form-
y in the imperial gallery at Vienna, whence it came to Florence by
:hange in the 18th century. —- Thauung‘s ‘Darcr‘.
