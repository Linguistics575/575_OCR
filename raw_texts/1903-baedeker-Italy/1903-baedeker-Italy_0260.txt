trees leads W. from the station to the SANTUABIO onus Bran
'Vnnamn, a celebrated pilgrimage—church, built at different times
between the end of the 15th and the end of the 17th cent., chieﬂy in

a pompous baroque style. It contains a series of admirnble 'Freseoes.

The paintings in the interior of the dome represent a. concert of
angels, and are by Gaudmn‘o Ferrari. Round the drum are several wooden
statues by Andrea Fusina. The frescoes immediately below the drum are
by Lam‘m’, those in the next section by Cesare del Hague and Bey-nardim
[mini (SS. Rochus and Sebastian). The remaining frescoes are oil by
Luini, who, as the story goes, sought an asylum in the sanctuary of Ss-
ronno after killing a man in self~defence, and had to work at the bidding
‘ot' the monks. In the passage leading to the choir are depicted the Mar-
riage of the Virgin and Christ among the doctors; in the choir itself,
the 'Adorstion of the Magi and the Presentation in the Temple. Above,
in the panels and lunettes, are Sibyls, Evangelists, and Church Fothcrs.
A small epse built out from the choir contains paintings of ‘St. Apollonia
to the right, and ‘St. Catherine to the left, each with an angel. '
