In and near the LuncauNo are several other interesting build-
ngs, with which we may terminate our walk.

San Niccolo. (Pl. 0, 4), founded about the year 1000 by Count
lugo of Tuscia as a Benedictine abbey, has an obliquely placed
lampam'lc, which contains an admirable winding staircase ascribed
J Niccolo Pisano. — The Piazza in front of the church is adorned
'ith a Statue of Ferdinand 1., by a pupil of Giov. da Bologna (1595).

In the Lungarno Regio (p. 406) is the Palazzo Lan/‘reducci (Pl. 6;
, D, 4), now Uppexinghi, designed by Cosimo Pagliani, with the
oyster“; of a chain over the entrance, with the motto ‘slla giornata’.
- A little to the E., just before the Ponte d1 Mezzo, rises the
Palauo Agoslim', a line Gothic brick ediﬁce of the 15th century.

At the N. and of the Ponte di Mezzo is the Piazza Garibaldi
'l. D, E, 4), with an excellent bronze Statue of Garibaldi, by
;t. Ferrari (1892; good reliefs on the pedestal). — In the busy
a del Box-go, a few yards to the N. of the bridge, rises ——

San Michele in Borgo [P]. E, 4), a ﬂat-roofed basilica, prob-
ly of the 11th cent., with an old crypt. The facade, which is said
have been designed by Niccolo Pisano (but more probably by his
pil Fra Guglielmo), was partly rebuilt in the Gothic style.

The mosaic flooring in San Pisrino (P1. E, 4), near the Piazza
iroli, is of early-Christian origin, and some of the columns are
.iqne. — The narrow Via delle Belle Terri, leading to the E. from

Piazza Cairoli, still preserves a distinctly medieval impress.
