Quarters. TURIN. 7. Route. 35

The Via della Consolata leads from the Piazza Savoia to the N.
to the church of La Consolata. At the 8. end of this street (No. 1)
is the Palazzo Panama (P1. 45; D, 2), built in the 18th cent. by
Planteri, a pupil of Juvara, with an imposing hall and staircase.

La Consolata (Pl. 2; D, 2), formed by the union of three
churches, is a building in the baroque style, erected by Guarini in
1679, and decorated by Juoara in 1714. The oval church of Sant’
Andrea is adjoined by a Campanile (10th cent.?), a relic of the
convent of Sant’ Andrea, and beyond the hexagonal Santuario delta
Consolata, which contains a highly revered Madonna, we enter a
circular Sacrisly , forming the third member of the group. The
passage on the right is hung with votive pictures. A new chapel
to the left centalns kneeling statues in marble of Maria Theresa,
Queen of Charles Albert, and Maria Adelaide, Queen of Victor Em-

manuel II. (both of whom died in 1855), by Vela, erected in 1861.

A little to the 11.11., and intersected by the Gorso Regina Margherlta,
lies the Pnzza EMANUEL! Frusna'ro (Pl. D, E, 1, 2), adioined on the N.
by the Piazza dei Molini. To the N. of the latter runs the Via Poute
Itasca (Pl. E, i), on the right side of which is the church of San Gioachino
(Pl, 12), a. basilica in the Lombard style, with a campanile 150 ft. high
erected in 1876-82 by Count Ceppi. -— The street then crosses the Dora
Bipart'a by the Pants Mecca, a handsome bridge of one arch, constructed
in 1830, and affording a ﬁne view of the Snpergs and of the Graian Alps.

From the Piazza Castello (p. 28) the Via Garibaldi leads to the
PIAZZA DBLLo Sm'ru'ro (Pl. 0, 2), with the huge Mont Cent's Tunnel
Monument, by Tabacchi (1879): the Genius of Science soars above
a pile of granite rocks, on which lie the stupeﬂed and conquered
giants of the mountain. On a tablet are the names of the engineers.

From the Via Garibaldi we proceed to the S. by the Corso Sic-
cardi to the Giardino dolls. Cittadella (Pl. 0, D, 2), where statues
were erected in 1871 to Broffcrio (d. 1866), poet and radical poli~
tician , and opposite, in 1873, to the jurist G. B. Cassinis. —
Farther on, at the corner of the Via della Cernaia, is a monument
by Gina. Bogliani (1834) in memory of Pietro Micca (Pl. 35; G, 3),
the heroic ‘soldato minatore’, who at the sacriﬁce of his own life
saved the citadel of Turin, on 30th Aug, 1706, by springing a mine
when the French grenadie'rsvhad already advanced to the very gates.
Nearly opposite is a bust of Al. Borella, the author, and in the Via
della Cernaia rises the statue of General Alex. Lamarmom (d. 1855
in the Crimea), by Cassano (1867).

The Hasohio della Cittadella (PI. 20, 0,3) is the former en-
trance to the citadel, erected in 1565 and nearly all pulled down
in 1857. A marble tablet above the gateway commemorates the
Italian soldiers who fell in Africa in 1887. The interior accommod-
ates the Musco Nazionale d’Artiglisrﬁr, a collection of ordnance from
the 14th cent. to the present day; adm. only by permission from
the ‘Direzione dell’ Ofﬁcina di Oostruzione d'Artiglieria’.
