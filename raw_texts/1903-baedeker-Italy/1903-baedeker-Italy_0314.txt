Pavia (250 ft.), with 33,922 inhab., capital of the province of
the same name, the see of a bishop, and the seat of a university,
is situated near the conﬂuence of the Ticino and the Po and is con-
nected with Milan by the Naviglio di Pavia (p. 115). Of the nu-
merous towers, which won for it the title of ‘Cltta delle Cento Torri‘,
and of the churches, which are said to have numbered 165 in the
14th cent., only a few now remain; but parts of the ancient ram-
parts and bulwarks stlll attest the ancient importance of the town.

Pavia is the Tici‘num of the ancients subsequently Papia, and was the
capital of the Lombards from 572 to 771.. In the middle ages it was the
faithful ally of the German emperors, until it was handed over in 1360,
by Emp. Charles IV., to Galeazzo II. Visconti (p. 111), as imperial vicar. —
The battle of Pavia, at which Francis 1. of France was defeated and taken
prisoner by Lunacy, general of Charles V., took place in the park of the
castle on 24th Feb., 1525.

Leaving the railway—station, we enter the Como CAVOUB (PL
A, B, 3) through the Ports Cavour (in a wall to the right is the
statue of a Roman magistrate), and following the Via Bossolaro to
the right reach the Piazza del Duomo.

The CATHEDRAL (P1. B, 3), begun in the early-Renaissance
style by Cristofo-ro Rocchi in 1488 on the site of two churches of
the Lombard period and continued with the co-operstion of Amadeo ;
and Bramantc, but never completed, is a vast ‘central’ structure
(comp. p. lxiv) with four arms. The facade (1898) and the dome
(300 ft. high) are modern. '

In the Isrsarox are altar-piece: by Gimpieln’no (1521; in the original
frame), Bern. Gum (Madonna with the rosary, 1531), Gina. Bait.~ Graph
Dam‘ele Creeps} and Fed. Farufﬁni (1854). In the crypt is the handsome .
marble altar (by Tomm. Orsoh'no, 1653) of St. Syrus (2nd cent.), who, accord-
ing to the legend, was ﬁrst bishop of Pavia.

Adjoining the church to the left rises the massive Torre Maggiore
(256 ft. high), a tower mentioned as early as 1330; the top story
was begun in 1583 by Pellegrlno Tibaldi.

We may now proceed to the 001250 Vrr'ronro EMANUEL]! (Pl. B,
1—4), a street intersecting the town in a straight direction from N.
to S., from the Ports di Milano to the Ports. Tioinese, and leading to
the Covered Bridge (14th cent. ; a pleasant promenade with pictur—
esque view) over the Ticino. A chapel stands on the bridge, half-
way across.

SAN MICHELE Macaroni; (Pl. 0, 4), to which the third side—
street to the right leads (coming from the bridge), a basilica of the
Lombard period, dates in its present Lombard-Romanesque form
