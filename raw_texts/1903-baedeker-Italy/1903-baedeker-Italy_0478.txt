322 Route 43. TREVISO.

esque town at the end of the lagoons, with 31,218 inhab., mostly
employed in the ﬁsheries, was founded before Venice, by which it
was soon conquered. During the war with Genoa it was taken by
the Gencese (1379), but recovered by the Venetians the following
year (comp. p. 266). The inhabitants have always diﬁered materially
in language and customs from the other inhabitants of the lagoon-
districts; but the quaint costume of the women is now to be seen
only on a few feast-days. None of the churches are worthy of note.

Trcuiso (33 ft.), with 32,793 inhab., the capital of the province
of its own name and the see of a bishop, lies on the small river
Silo, at its conﬂuence with the Bottcm'ga, which is mentioned by
Dante (Paradise, IX, 43) under the name of Cagnan. Under the
name of Taroisium 'l‘reviso was a place of some importance in the
Roman era, and from 1339 onwards it belonged to Venice. It was
the birthplace of three distinguished Venetian painters, Lot-euro
Lotto, Rocco Marconi, and Paris Bordone. Some of the narrow streets
are ﬂanked with arcades, and the facades of many houses show traces
of ancient frescoes. The city-walls, bordered by the Sile and several
canals, were constructed by Fra Giocondo (p.223) at the end of the
15th cent. and are still in good preservation.
