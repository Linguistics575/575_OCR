bridge), with 3061 inhab., is ﬁnely situated 1 M. above the station,
it the entrance to the Val Toumanche. Its houses are picturesquely
scattered over the gorge of the Matmoire or Marmara, a torrent de~
scending from the Matterhorn; and in the middle of the town is a
bridge spanning the ravine in one ﬁne arch. (To Val Tournanche,
and over the Theodule Pass to Zermatt, see Bucdekcr’a Switzerland.)

The line crosses the Matmoire, traverses a deep cutting through a
deposit of debris, threads two tunnels, and reaches (671/2 M.) Cham-
bave (1555 ft.), noted for its wine. To the W. opens the view of the
beautiful valley of Aosta, rich in fruit and surrounded by lofty
mountains, with the three-peaked Rutor (p. 60) in the background.

Beyond a tunnel the line traverses a mass of debris at Diemoz
(viaduct 107 yds. long), and crosses the Dora. To the left lies the
picturesque chateau of Fénis (with old mural paintings), at the mouth
of the Clavalité Valley, through which peeps the snowy peak of the
Tmiva (p. 58). The train crosses the Dora twice and reaches (72 M.)
Nu: (1765 ft.; Croce d’Oro), with a mined castle, at the mouth of
the Val St. Barthélcmy. We then recross to the right bank of the
Dora. 0n the slope above (73 M.) St. Marcel, which lies at the
month of the valley of the same name (p. 68), is the much-frequented
pilgrimage-church of Plan. We again cross the Dora to (741/2 M.)
Owt- Villcfranche (1756 ft.), with the chﬁteau of Quart on a hill to
the right (2485 ft.). We then cross the Bagnérc and the Buthier.

Aosta (1910 ft.), with 7554 inhab., the Augusta. Praetorian Salas~
mum of the Romans and now the capital of the Italian province of
hosts, lies at the conﬂuence of the Bulhier and the Doire or Dora
Baum. The valley’was anciently inhabited by the Salassi, a Celtic
race, who commanded the passage of the Great and the Little
St. Bemard,the two chief routes from Italy to Gaul. They frequently
harassed the Romans in various ways, until they were conquered in
3.0. 25 by Terentius Varro, who sold many of them as slaves at
Eporedia (p. 51). To protect the roads Varro then founded a camp,
790 yds. long and 625 yds. broad, with 22 square towers, and gar-
risoned it with 3000 soldiers of the Praetorian cohorts. The import—
ance of the Roman Aosta is indicated by the extant remains.

Near the railway~station, which lies on the 8. side of the town,
is an excellent bronze Statue of Victor Emmanuel 11., by Tortone
(1886), commemorating the king’s sporting expeditions amid the
Graian Alps. A short walk brings us to the ancient Town Walls.
