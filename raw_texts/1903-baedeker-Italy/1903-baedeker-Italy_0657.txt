”605, ‘599, Titian, Portraits of Francesco Marla della Rovers
and Eleonora Gonzaga, Duke and Duchess of Urbino (1537).

These noble ‘portraits were executed in 1537, when the Duke was
appointed Genet isaimo o! the League against the Turks. The Duke
' has a martial bearing, the look of the Duchess is stately but subdued.
To make the diderenee apparent between the blanched complexion of a
dame accustomed to luxury and ease and the tanned {ace of a soldier
habitually exposed to the weather, Titian skilfull varied the details of
technical execution. Here he is minute and ﬁnis ed, there resolute and
broad. Here the tinted and throbbing ﬂesh is pitted against a warm light
ground, there the sallow olive against a dark wall. — C. d: 0.

m On an easel: ”626. Titian, The so-called ‘Flora’, painted
probably before 1520, and still in Giorgione’s manner.

There is nothing in this ethereal Flora to shock the sensitive eye.
The proportions and features are of surprising loveliness, reminding us
in their nrity of some of the choicest antiques. The masterly and clear

light sc e is attained by the thin disposal of pigments, the broad plane
,0! tinting, and the delicate shade of all but imperceptible haclf-tfnces. -—
