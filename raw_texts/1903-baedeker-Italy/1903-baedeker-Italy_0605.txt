to Flow. LUGGA. 57. Route. 419

A little to the N.W. stands the small church of San Giusto
(Pl. 0, D, 3), with a ﬁne portal of the 12th century. Near this
spot stood the palace of the Lombard dukes. — The Romanesque
church of San Cristoforo (Pl. 7; D, 3), in the Via Fillungo, dates
from the 11-12th centuries. Pretty facade.

0n the W. side of the Piazza Napoleone (p. 417) is situated the
Palaaao Provinciale (P1. 10; C, 3), formerly Pal. Ducalc, begun in
1578 by Bart. Ammanati on the site of a palace (destroyed in 1676)
of Castruccio and the Guinigi, continued in 1728 by Franc. Pint
and Fel.Juvara with important deviations from the original plan,
and still unﬁnished. In the imposing inner court stands a monu-
ment, by Augusto Passaglia, to the jurist Franc. Carram (1805-88).

In the archway leading to the second court is (left) the entrance
to the Plcrunn GALLERY (Pinacoteca), important on account of two
paintings (from San Romano) by Fra Bartolomeo and sculptures by
Matteo Civitali (open daily, 10-2, free; at other times i in; closed

on Mon., Easter Sun., and Christmas Day).

From the Vasrrsuu, which contains mediaeval sculptures, we ascend
the staircase to the ﬁrst ﬂoor.

movement of the principal ﬁgure, the varied but always elegant attitudes
and action of the redainder are almost matchless instances of the mode
in which scientiﬁc calculation gives nature as a result. In most of the
minutiw unusual power of observation is revealed. Nothing can be more
pleasing than the manner of dividing the ﬁngers with their play suggesting
unconsciousness. Admirable are the draperies in which the folds are con-
:entrated on the bends‘ (C. d: 0.). — In this room also are: 1. Pompso
