Hero Sodsn'ni, elected as gonfaloniere for life in 1502, succeeded in re
capturing Pisa, which had been freed by the French; but in 1512 the party
of the Medici regained the upper hand and recalled the brothers Giulia“
and Giovanni. The former soon resigned his authority, the latter became
Pope Leo X., and they were followed by Lorenro, son of Piero II. and
afterwards Duke of Urbino (d. 1519), Giulio, the son of the Giuliano who
was murdered in 1478 (elected pope, as Clement VII. in 1528), and Alan
sandrc, a natural son of the last-named Lorenzo. The family was again
banished in 1527, but Emp. Charles V., who had married his natural
daughter Margaret (afterwards Duchess of Parma) to Alessandro, attacked
the town and took it in 1530 after a siege of eleven months, during which
Michael Angelo, as engineer on the side of the republic, and the brarc
partisan Ferruccio greatly distinguished themselves. The emperor then
appointed Alessandro hereditary Duke of Florence. The assassination of
the latter, perpetrated by his own cousin Lorenzo, 7th Jan., 1537, did not
conduce to the re-establishment of the republic. He was succeeded by
Cosimo I. (b. 1519). son of Giovanni delle Baude Nero ((1. 1526), the only
soldier of the Medici family, who was a descendant of Lorenzo, brother
of the elder Cosimo. The armed revolt of the Florentine republicans in
