422 Route 57. LUCCA. From Pisa

We now cross the Piazza San Frediano, which adjoins the
church on the E., and reach the Piazza dd Mcrcato, or vegetable-
market. The Palazzo Nobili, No. 14 in the Piazza S. Frediano
(left side), contains a ﬁne Madonna by Giulio Romano, with the
features of Raphael’s Fornarina in the Pal. Barberini at Rome. —-
' The houses enclosing the market stand on the foundations of a Roman
Amphitheatre (Pl. D, 2) dating from the end of the ﬁrst or begin-
ning of the second Christian century. Two series of the arcades, of
54 arches each, are still visible on the outside; length 135 yds.,
width 105 yds. ; the arena (the present markebplace) 871/2 by 58 yds.

To the E. of the Amphitheatre is situated the church of San Pietro
Somaldt' (Pl. D, E, 2), founded during the Lombard eriod, restored in the
13111 cent., and modernized in the interior in the 1 th century. -— Farther
on is San Franmco (Pl E. 2), erected in 1228, containing the monuments
of the poet Giov. Guidiccioni (1600-41) and of the celebrated Castruodo
Castracaui (d. 1328; p. 416). It is now used as a military magazine.

To the S. of the Amphitheatre, Via Guinigi No. 13, stands the
’Plnazzo Gunner (Pl. D, 2), an Italian Gothic structure of brick
with a high tower. No. 16, opposite, is a Palazzo Guinigi also.

The Palazso Mazmrosa (P1. ‘21; D, 3), Via Santa Croce '26, con-
tains some good paintings. In the court is a relief by Bidulnus
(Christ on the Mt. of Olives).

The church of Santa Maria Forisportam (Pl. E, 3), founded in
the 8th cent. (?) and rebuilt in the 12th, contains antique columns.
At the 4th altar on the right is a St. Lucy, by Guercino. -—- The old
Porto. San Geroasio (Pl. E, 3), rising with its two massive round
towers at the end of the Via Santa Croce, is a relic of the second
town-wail (13th cent).

A spare hour should be devoted to a ‘Wanx 0N run Rearran'rs,
which, especially on the W. and N. sides, aﬂord a succession of
pleasant views of the town with its numerous towers, and of the
beautiful mountains in the vicinity (Monti Pisani, Alpi Apnme,
Apennines). In the grounds on the S.W. side is the monument of
Charles 111. of Spain (P1. 13 ; B, 3, 4), erected by his granddaughter,
the Duchess Marie Louise, in 1822. On the southernmost bastion,
now named Piazzalc Vittorio Emanuele Secondo, is a pleasant cafe,
in front of which is a marble statue of Victor Emmanuel 11., by
Aug. Passaglia (1885).

The Euvmous of Lucca are beautiful and contain many pleasant yillu,
but in summer the country is hot and destitute of shade.

The traveller should visit the Villa. di Harlin. 3 M. to the NIE, with
its beautiful grounds, ﬁne points of view and fountains, resembling Karly
near Paris (whence the name), and wi h a Greek chapel containing old
paintings, etc. The road thither leads through the Ports. Santa Maria
(Pl. D, 1), and then diverges to the right from- that to the Baths 0! Lucca.
