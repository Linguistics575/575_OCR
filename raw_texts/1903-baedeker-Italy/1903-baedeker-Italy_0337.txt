Duomo Nuooo. BRESCIA. 34. Route. 201

addition on the top, due to L. Vanvilelli (1769—73), is-to be replaced
by a dome in accordance with the original design. — The handsome
adjacent building on the right, the Archivio e Camera Notarile (Pl. 1),
is probably also by Fromentone.

0n the opposite (E.) side of the Piazza, above an arcade, rises the
Torre dell' Orologio, or clock-tower, with a large dial (twice 1 to
12). The bell is struck by two iron ﬁgures as at Venice (p. 275).
— To the left rises a Monument, erected in 1864 to the Brescians
who fell in 1849 (p. 200); on the pedestal are scenes from the
contest. — The S. side of the piazza is occupied by the Monte di
Pieth, a plain Renaissance building begun in 1484; the E. half,
With a handsome loggia, was erected in 1597 by Pier Maria Bag-
nadore.

To the SE. of the Piazza del Comune is the ‘Duomo Nuovo
(Pl. 0, 3), a handsome church begun in 1604 by Giov. Bait. Lantana
(but the dome, 270 ft. high, not completed till 1825). It is in the‘
form of a Greek cross, with a lengthened choir.

Inrnrox. By the ﬁrst pillar on the right is the large monument of
Bishop Nave (d. 1831), by Horm- by the ﬁrst pillar an the left, the man-
ment of Bishop Ferrari (d. 1848). The second altar on the right is
adorned with modern statues in marble of Faith, by Ssluront, and Ho e,
by Emanuels', and a painting Christ healing the sick, by Gregoleui (135)).

From a door between the 2nd and 3rd altars 25 steps descend
to the Duomo Vecchio (Pl. 0, 3), generally called La Rotonda (shown
by the sacristan of the Duomo Nuovo). This massive dome-struc-
ture (of the 10th cent. ?) is circular, as its name imports, with an
ambulatory, and rests on eight short pillars in the interior. Beneath
is the crypt, or Basilica di San Filastro (now lighted by electricity),
Supported by 42 columns. This represents an early- Christian
basilica, the ground-plan of which was probably followed in the
curious old addition on the E. side of the church, consisting of a
transept and choir with lateral chapels.

Bishop Maggi (d. 1308), by Ugo da Cam one(?). — Altar-piece in the added
