‘ Vand Via Cauour. FLORENCE. 58. Route. 497

who Ohiostro dello loalro (Pl. G, 2), an elegant court of the early‘—

1 Renaissance, surrounded with colonnades and adorned with ad-
mirable 'Frescoes in two shades of brown from the history of John -'
the Baptist, with allegorical ﬁgures and rich ornamentation, by
Andrea del Sarto and Franciabigio (ca. 1614-26). Adm, see p. 437.

On the right: 1. Alleégorical ii ure of Faith (ca. 1520), 2. The Angel
a caring to Zacharias (15 ; 3. Via tation (159A); 4. Nativity of the Baptist
( 5 with the noble ﬁgure of Zacharias writing); 5. Departure of John
from his father‘s house, and 6. His meeting with Christ (these two by
Irancs'abivto, 1518-19). — 7. Baptism of Christ (the earliest and weakest
of all, perhaps painted by the two artists in common, 15147); 8. Allegorical
ﬁgure of Love (c. 1520), 9. Alleforiesl ﬁgure of Justice (1515); 10. John
preaching in the desert (1514?)- 1. John haptising (1517):, 12. John made

head brought in on a chsrger: 18. Allegorical ﬁgure of Hope (the last three

the inﬂuence of Albert Darer. For example, in the Semen of John, the
Phorlsee in the long robe and the woman with the child are borrowed
frorn the engravings of the German master.

Proceeding farther to the N.E., we traverse the Via Salvestrina
to the left, and enter the Via San Gallo, No. 74 in which, a corner
house, is the 'Palasao chint, formerly the Palazxo Pandolﬁnt
(Pl. G, H, 2), erected in 1516-20 by Giov. Franc. da Sangallo, from

,ths designs of Raphael.

A little to the N.W. of the Piazza San Marco, at Via Ventisette
Aprile A, is the little Canaoolo di Bant’ Apollonia (Pl. G, 3), the
refectory of a monastery of that name (founded in 1339), now used
as a military store. Since 1890 the Genacolo has contained a small
picture-gallery (adm., see p. 437).

In the Ann-Roots are paintings of the 15th cent, chieﬂy from the studio
of Dom. Ghirlandq/o. — The Mars Roost contains several works by Andrea
del Castagsso. On three of the walls are frescoes (ohOut1435l), transferred
to canvas and partly retouched (previously in the Villa Pandolﬂni at
ngnaja), of nine portrait-ﬁgures: Filippo Scolari, surnamed Pippo B one.
(,3, ‘Obergﬂan‘ or supreme count of Temesvar, the con ueror o the
Turks; ‘F nsta degli Uherti, leader of the Ghibellines; N e. Accidnoli,
mentioned on p. 524; the Cumman Sihylr Tomyris; Dante; Petr-rob;
and Boccaceio. 0n the wall to the right is an admirably preserved
'Fresco ol the Last Supper, with ﬁgures charged with life (a late work
of the master; ca. 1450?): above, the Cruciﬁxion, with the Entombment
on the right and the Resurrection (beardless Christ) on the left.

The Via Ventisette Aprils ends on the N. W. at the large Piazza
dell’ Indipendenza (Pl. F, 2; omn., see p. 434), which is em-
bellished with bronze statues of the statesmen Bettina Ricasoli
(1809-80), by Augusto Rivalta, and Ubaldino Perussi (1822-91;
Sindaco of Florence from 1864 to 1878), by R. Romanelli, hoth
erected in 1897.

The Via delia Fortezza leads hence to the Vials Filippo Strozzi
(electric tramway No. 1, p. 434), and to the Fortesza San Giovanni
Battista, now the Fortcsze dc Basso (Pl. E, F, 1), built by Duke
Alexander in 1634-35 to overawe the city. — From the E. side of
the fort pleasant public gardens extend as far as the picturesque
Via Lumgo il Mugaone (Pl. I“, H, 1).
