the Lombards, between the Monte Pirchiriano (3150 ft.; right) and
the Monte Caprasio (left), where Charlemagne defeated the Lombard

King Desiderlus in 774.

Brigue (2245 ft.; 116th dos Oouronnes at Paste,- Angleterre;
Terminus 5' Railway Restaurant), a well-built little town, with a
turreted chateau, is the terminus of the railway (see Baedeker’s
Swans-land), and the beginning of the Simplon Route, constructed
by order of Napoleon in 1800-1806, which here quits the valley of
the Rhone, and seconds in numerous windings.

0n the left bank of the Rhone, 11/; 11. above Brigue, is the N. entrance
of the Simpler: Tunnel, the construction of which, begun at both the Swiss
and the Italian ends in Nov., 1898, is expected to take 51/: years, at an
estimated cost of 69,500,000 fr. This tunnel, which is to be 121/; M. in
length. diﬁ‘ers from all similar constructions inasmuch as it consists of two
parallel tunnels, 55 ft. apart but connected with each other by transverse
shafts at intervals of 220 yds. Only one of these tunnels is at present being
completely ﬁnished, the other being used for ventilation, for the supply of
water, and for the conveyance of the material and workmen. From the
N. entrance (2255 ft.) the tunnel ascends at the agaadient of 20: 1(XX) to the
IS‘I. ll.) culminating point (2303 ft.), which lies 7 ft. below the mountain-
surface above (between the Furg enbnumhorn and the Wasenhorn); then,
after remaining on the level for yds., it descends (gradient 70: 1000) to
the (ﬁll. M.) s. entrance (2C80ft.), at Isellc, in the valley of the Diveria
(p. 4). Ten or twelve hydraulic boring-machines are in operation at either
end; visitors are admitted to the works on Tues. and Frid. at 8 p.m.
