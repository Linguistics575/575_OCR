‘An attractive narrative composition, aﬂ‘ording us a glimpse of the

‘It may be that looking closely at the ‘Pieth‘, our e es will lose
hemselves in a chaos of touches; but retiring to the focal istance, they
ecover themselves and distinguish all that Titian meant to convey. In
he group of the Virgin and Christ — a group full of the deepest and

which stnkes us in the ‘Pie ‘ of Michaelangelo.‘ — 6'. at C.

ression. The work, however, cannot be put on a level with the great
reations of Titian‘. —— 0. it C.
