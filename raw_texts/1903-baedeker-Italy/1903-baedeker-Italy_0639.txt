to the Piazza del Duomo. The Via di Ports Rossa, the ﬁrst side-
street to the left, leads to the Mercato Nuooo, where ﬂowers and
straw and woollen wares are now sold. The market is adorned with
a good copy of the antique boar in bronze (p. 459 , by Pietro Tacca;
the handsome arcades are by G. B. Tasso (154 ). In the niches
are modern statues of celebrated Florentines, among them Michele
di Lando by Ant. Bortone, Giov. Villani by Trentanove, and Fernando
Oeunini by Mancini. Farther on in the same street (No. 9; on
the left) is the Palace Davamati (P1. E, 5), a well-preserved
castellated building of the 14th cent., with a picturesque court
(hence to Santa Trinitl, see p. 506).

In the Via de’ Calzajoli, on the left, rises the church of ‘Or
Ban Hichele (P1. E, b), so called after the church of San Michele
in One, which originally occupied this site and was replaced by
a grain market in 1284. Only the lower story of the present build-
ing, dating from 1336-1412, is used as a church, the upper story,
which served as a com-magazine down to the middle of the
16th cent., being new used for lectures upon Dante. The window-
tracery is very beautiful. The external decoration of the ediilce
with statues was undertaken by the twelve guilds, whose armorial
bearings, some by Luca delta Bobbie, are placed above the niches.
