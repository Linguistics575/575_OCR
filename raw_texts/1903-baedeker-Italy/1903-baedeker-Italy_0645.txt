Cathedral Muuum. FLORENCE. 58. Route. 455

Farther on, at the corner of the Via dell' Orivolc (p. 466), is the
Palauo Riccardi, formerly Guadagni (Pl. F, 4, 5).

Opposite the choir of the cathedral is situated the Opera del
Duomo (Pl. F, 4; No. 24, entrance to the left in the court). Here
was opened in 1891 the *Cathedral Huseum, or Mute di Santa
Maria del Flore, containing chieﬂy works of art from the cathedral
and the baptistery (adm., see p. 437). Lists of the works of art are
supplied for the use of visitors. Catalogue (1891) 1/3 fr.

Gnovxn Fmon. In the vestibule, a bust of Brunelleschi, after
his death-mask, by his pupil Buggiano. Above the door (left), St. Ze-
nobius between two angels, a ﬁne coloured relief from the studio
of Luca delta Robbia (ca. 1450). — The hall contains numerous
architectural fragments: also 40. Figure of the Madonna, by a
master of the Pisan School (lath cent.); 51. (by the staircase),
Etruscan relief. — 0n the staircase are reliefs from the choir-screen
of the cathedral, by Baccio Bandimlli and Giovanni dall‘ Opera.

Finer FLoon. In the large hall, on the end-walls (71 to the right,
and 72 to the left), are the ’erome Gannnams (Cantorie) from the
cathedral, with the celebrated reliefs of children by Luca delta

Robbia (1431-38) and Donatello (1433-38), taken down in 1688 and
put together again, with additions, in 1890 by Luigi del Moro. The
naive charm of childhood has probably never been better expressed
than in the ten clearly and beautifully arranged “Groups of singing
ind dancing boys and girls by Luca della Robbie, which are equally
Lttractive for their truth and naturalness and for their grace of
novement and form. The four ‘Reliefs of dancing Genii by Dona-
ello are full of Vigour and expression, but meant to be seen from
L distance. In their exuberant vigour, they present a very signi-
lcant specimen of the master’s work. — Also on the right end-
wall: 108. Intarsia Tablet, representing St. Zenobius between two
leacons, by Giuliano da Majano. —- On the left side-wall: De Fabris’
dodel for the facade of the Cathedral; 77. Relief of the Madonna, by
igosu'no di Duccio. 0n the back’wall are two frames (87, 88) with
:Iegant Byzantine miniatures in wax mosaic (11th cent.). — On
he right side-wall: 92, 93. St. Reparata and Christ, marble statuettes
)y Andrea Pisano; 94. Madonna, a relief by Portigiani; 95, 96. An-
Iunciation, group by Niccolo d'Arezzo. - ‘97. Massive Silver Altar
rom the Baptistery, with twelve reliefs from the history of John
he Baptist. The front was executed in 1366-1402 by Betta Gert,
Leonardo di Ser Giovanni, and others, while the statue of the Baptist

he ﬂne Birth of John, by Ant. Pollajuoto, and his *Death, by Ver-
occhio, date from 1477-80. On this altar, 98. Silver Cross by A.
