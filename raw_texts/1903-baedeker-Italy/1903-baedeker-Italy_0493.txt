were re~erected in the Suns or ﬂu Cnuacs. The Code Napoleon was
abolished, and the ecclesiastical administration, as organised by Sixtus V.
in 159), re-established. The four northernmost provinces, Bologna Fer-
rara, Revenue, and Forll. were governed by a cardinal with the title of
Legal: (whence these districts were called legatious), whose sway was
arbitrary and despotic in the extreme. The courts of justice and all the chief
magistncies were administered by priests, and never probably did a gov-
ernment can for itself such a fund of hatred from its subjects. In
1821, 1831, and 1848, the Emilia succeeded in throwing off the yoke of its
dukes and legates, but on each occasion the insurrection was crushed
by Austrian intervention. The war of 1809 rendered the rising under Farim'
a more successful undertaking, and by the plebiscite of 12th March, 1860,
the annexation of the Emilia to Piedmont was accomplished.
