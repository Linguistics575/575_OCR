120 Route 19. MILAN. a. From the Piana del

VIEW. To the extreme left (S.W.), Monte Viso, then Mont Cenis
(p. 2); between these two, lower down, the Snperga (p. 39) near Turin;
Mont Blanc, Great St. Bernard; Monte Ross, the most conspicuous of all;
then, the Mischabelhiirner, Monte Moro, the Fletschhorn, the Monte Leone
near the Simplon, the Bernese Alps, the St. Gotthard and Spliigen, the
Bcrnina, and (in the distance to the E.) the Ortler. To the S. the Certosa di
Pavia (p. 144) is visible, farther E. the towers and domes of Pavia itself,
in the background the Apennines. Perfectly clear weather is necessary
to see all these points.

In front of the cathedral rises the colossal bronze Equestrian
Statue of Victor Emmanuel 11., completed in 1896 from the model
by Ercole Rosa ((1. 1893). The well-executed reliefs on the pedestal
represent the Allies entering Milan after the battle of Magenta.

To the S. stands the Palazzo Beale (Pl. E, F, 5, 6; adm., see
p. 115), built in 1772 on the site of the Palazzo dl Corte, the earliest
mansion of the Visconti and the Sforza. It is adorned with frescoes
by Appiam', *B. Luim' (from the Oasa della Pelucca, near Monza), and
Hayes, and contains several handsome saloons. In the street to
the left, beyond the palace, are visible the tower (1336; built by
F. Pecorari) and apse of the ﬁne half-Romanesque church of San
Gottardo, formerly the chapel of the Visconti. — Adjacent, on the E.,
in the Piazza del Campo Santo (formerly the cathedral-cemetery),
rises the large Archiepiscopal Palace (Palazzo Arcivescovilc;
Pl. F, 5), originally built at the end of the 15th cent. in the early-
Itcnaissance style, but altered in 1570 by Pellegrino Tibaldi, while
the facade towards the Piazza Fontana was designed by Fabio
Mangone. The handsome ﬁrst court has a double colonnade and
marble statues (Moses and Aaron) by Tantardini and Strazza. The
second court, on the side next the Piazza Foutana, is embellished
with Corinthian columns of the 15th century. — The W. side of
the Piazza del Duomo is skirted by the Via Carlo Alberto (see p. 128),
beyond which, to the N.W., lies the Piazza de’ Mercanti (p. 128).

On the N. side is the imposing palatial facade (ﬁnished in
1878) which forms the entrance to the 'Galleria. Vittorio Emanuele
(Pl. E, 5), connecting the Piazza del Duomo with the Piazza della
Scala. This is the most spacious and attractive structure of the
kind in Europe. It was built in 1865-67 by Gius. Mcngom', who
unfortunately lost his li'fe by falling from the portal in 1877. The
gallery, which is said to have cost 8 million fr. (320,0001.) , is
320 yds. in length, 16 yds. in breadth, and 94 ft. in height. The
form is that of a Latin cross, with an octagon in the centre, crowned
at a height of 160 ft. with a glass cupola.

In the Largo Santa Margherita (Pl. E, 5), on the W. side of
the Galleria, stands a bronze statue, by Ettore Ferrari (1901), of
Carlo Catlaneo (1801-69), the economist and patriot.

The Piazza DELLA Scans (Pl. E, 4) is embellished with the
Monument of Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) by Magni, erected
in 1872. The colossal statue of the master stands on a lofty pedestal,
