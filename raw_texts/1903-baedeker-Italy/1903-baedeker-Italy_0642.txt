452 Route 58. FLORENCE. (1. Fiona dd Duomo:

of Florence, was erected on the site of the earlier church of St. Re-
parata, which had been used as a cathedral since 1128. The erection
was decreed by a popular vote of 1294. The ﬁrst architect was Ar-
nolfo di Cambio, who superintended the works from 1296 down to
his death in 1301 and was succeeded by Giotto (1334-36) and An-
drea Pisano (1336-49). In 1357 the plan was expanded, and the
nave with its spacious vaulting was begun from a design by Francesco
Talmtz'. The exterior was also farther ornamented with marble in
harmony with the original details. In 1366 a commission of 24 ar-
chitects met to decide the form of the choir and the dome, and their
plan (of 1367) has since been adhered to. The three space were
completed in 1407-21. 'On 19th August, 1418, was announced the
public competition for the technical execution of the dome, of which
Vasari has given so racy an account, and in which the genius of
Filippo anelleschi secured the victory in spite of the jealousy of
rivals and the doubts of the cognoscenti. The construction of the
cupola took fourteen years (1420-34). The [church was finally
consecrated on March 25th (the old Florentine New Year’s Day),
1436, but the lantern on the top of the dome, also designed by
Brunelleschi, was not completed till 1462. The building (larger
than all previous churches in Italy, comp. p. 366) is 656 ft. in
length and 342 ft. (across the octagon) in breadth; the dome is
300 ft. high, with the lantern 352 ft. (ascent, see p. 454). The nave
and aisles are adjoined, in place of a transept, by an octagonal domed
space, with three polygonal apses. The unﬁnished old facade (comp.
pp. 456, 491) was removed in 1588. The present facade was erected
in 1875—87 from the design of Emilio De Fabric (p. 456), which
originally contemplated three gables. The modem bronze side-door
on the N. is by Ant. Passaglia, that on the S. by Gil“. Cassioli (1899).

Above the ﬁrst door on the S. side is a Madonna of the 14th century.
The decoration of the second 8. door is by Hero dd Giovanni Tsduco (1395-99):
foliage with naked putti, foreshadowing the Renlissnnce spirit; in the
lunette, the Madonna between two an els. — The corresponding '11. Door
was executed by Niccolo d‘Areuo. 1 . The admirable baa—relief of the
Madonna with the girdle, over the door, is ascribed to Nam da‘ BM

1414). On the adjoining pillars are two ﬁgures by Donatello (early works;
106 and 1408), who executed also the two prophets‘ heads in the cdiments
(M22). The mosaic is by Domenico and Davide 02:6erqu (1A ).

The Interior. though somewhat bare and dark, is very impressive
owing to its grand dimensions. The gallery detracts from the (street of the
arches. The choir is appropriately placed under the dome.

0n the entrance-wall, beside the main entrance is a marble status 01‘
Pope Boniface VIII. , erroneously attributed to Andrea Mano, preserved
from the old facade; above, two equestrian portraits (in grinaille) as mural
tombs: to the right John Hawkwood (d. 1391.), an English soldier-
fortune who served the Republic in 1392 (‘the ﬁrst real general of modern
times‘, according to Hallam), by Paolo Uccello (1138); to the left, the eon~
dottiere Niccolo da Tolentino (d. 1433), by Andrea del Cauayno (1456). Over
the principal portal: Coronation oi' the Virgin in mosaic, by Gaddo Oaddi:
at the sides, frescoes (angels) by San“ ds' Tito, restored. — The design-
for the stained glass in the three windows were drawn by Lor. Gha'bcrti.‘

the design of the coloured mosaic pavement is attributed to Baccs'o d'Ay-ou
and Francesco do Bangallo.
