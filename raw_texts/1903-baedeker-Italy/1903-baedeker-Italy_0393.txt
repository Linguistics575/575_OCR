In the vicinity is the ”intro Olimpico (P1. C, 2; custodian to
the left, behind the theatre, Contrada Teatro Olimpico No. 987; fee
1/2 fr.), begun by Palladio in 1579, completed in 1584, after his
death, by Scamozzi, and inaugurated by the performance of the
‘(Edipns Tyrannus’ of Sophocles. Palladio adhered generally to the
precepts of Vitruvius as to the construction of ancient theatres, but
the building is far from being a mere imitation. The auditorium
rises in thirteen semi-oval tiers, while the orchestra and the two-
storied stage lie 5 ft. below the level of the seats. The three door-
openings at the back of the stage afford views of ascending streets,
in curiously deceptive relief.

The Contrada di Santa Corona, diverging just before the E. end
of the Corso. leads to the Dominican church of Santa Corona. (P1.
0, ‘2), a Gothic brick ediﬁce of 1260-1300, with a plain facade.

2nd altar on the left, Five saints by Bart. Montague (in rich Renaissance
frame), beside it, Angels by Sperama, frescoes; 4th altar on the left, Ma-
donna. of the 14th cent., with angels by Fogoh‘no (ca. 1530), beside it, two
saints, in fresco; 5th altar, ‘Baptism of Christ by Giovanni Bellini, in a
fine frame a late work and one of the ﬁnest productions of the master
(about 1501 '1). Cha e1 to the right of the choir, two ﬁne Gothic mural mon-
uments (15th cent).

The Contrada Santo Stefano, opposite, a little to the right, leads
to Santa Stefano (Pl. 0, 2); in the left transept, Palma Vccchio,
*Madonne with St. Lucia and George, an admirable example of his
middle period (best light in the morning).

Opposite, to the left, in the Contrsda Giacomo Zanella, stands
the unﬁnished Palazzo Thienc (now the Banca Popolare), the front
designed by Palladio (1556), the back part facing the Contrada
Porti, being an early-Renaissance structure. Opposite to it rises
the imposing Puazzo Ponro-Bannansno (Pl. B, C, 2), by Palladio
(1570), and farther on, to the left, are the Gothic Pat. Porto, with
an attractive early-Renaissance portal of 1481, and two Palaui
Collcom', of which one is Gothic with a line colonnade and staircase,
the other by Palladio.
