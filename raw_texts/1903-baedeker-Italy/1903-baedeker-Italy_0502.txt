A few paces to the S. of the main street, in the Piazza San
Prospero, is the church of San Pnosrnno (Pl. 0, 3), re—erected in

naissance facade, completed only in the lower part, in which in-
teresting traces of the earlier Romanesque church of the 12th cent.
with frescoes of the 13th, are still observable. Above the principal
entrance are recumbent statues of Adam and Eve by Prospero Cle-
menti. At the top of the tower is a group in copper (Madonna and

On the S. side of the piazza is the Municipio (Pl. 0, 3); at the

W. side is the house in which Lodovico Ariosto (1474-1533; p. 355),
the poet, is said to have been born. His father, Niccolo Ariosti of
Ferrara, was commandant of the citadel at the time. -— Proceed-
ing hence to the W. by the Via San Pietro Martire, we reach the
church of the 'Manomu DELLA Genus (Pl. A, B, 3), built in 1597
from a design by Balbi, in the form of a Greek cross covered with
a dome. It was ﬁnished after Balbi’s death by Franc. Pacchiom',
and was restored in 1890 (closed 12.30-4).

The lsrnmon is distinguished for the beauty of its proportions and
for its charming decorations in stucco. It is adorned with frescoes in the
nave as far as the dome and in the left transept by Luna Ferrari (1605-15!)
of Reggie, a pupil of Guido Reni. The frescoes in the choir are by Tian'm‘

highly-revered ﬁgure of the Madonna, drawn by Mia Orss‘ (1589; covered),

The Theatre (Pl. 0, 2; 1857), the chief boast of Reggie, is a re-
markably tine ediﬁce for so small a town. — The Museum (P1. 0, 2)
