42 M. Gonzaga-Reggiolo. —- 54 M. Carpi (98 ft.; Leone d’ Om),
a town of 22,876 inhab. and an episcopal see, with an old Palace,
which from 1327 was the residence of the Pie family. Alberto Pio
(1475-1531), a pupil of Aldus ganutins and a patron of Ariosto,
built the handsome Palace Court n the chapel, frescoes by Bernar-
dino Losco), and began the New Cathedral after plans by Baldassare
Peruzzi (ca. 1514). In the interior, to the left, a Christ by Begarelli
(p. 348), two statues by Prospero Clementi, and a pulpit of the
11th century. The Loggia opposite the cathedral, the Colonnades,
and the fortiﬁcations also testify to the taste and energy of this
prince, who was expelled by Charles V. in 1525. A street leads
from the Loggia to the Franciscan church of San Niccolo, founded in
1493. Behind the palace is the early-Romanesque Old Cathedral
(Chiesa Sagra), of which the choir and tower alone remain. The
ancient portal has been inserted in the facade designed by Pernzzi.
