Luino (690 ft), a pleasant and busy town with 6000 inhab., is
Sltuated a little to the N. of the mouth of the True (p. 164). The
Statue ome-ibaldi, near the pier, commemorates his brave but futile
attempt to continue the contest here with his devoted guerilla band
after the conclusion of the armistice between Piedmont and Austria
on Aug. 15th, 1848. The church of San Pietro, in the S.W. of the
town, contains injured frescoes by Bemardino Luim’, a native of
the place (ca._1470-1530). Among the numerous tasteful villas in
the vicinity is the Palazzo Crivelli, to the N., surrounded by pines.
‘ Pleasant walk to Maccagno (see above). — At the mouth of the Tresa,
V211. to the S.W.. lies Germingnaqa, with the large silk-spinning (ﬁlande)

On the W. bank rise two grotesque-looking castles (Castclli di
Cannes-o), half in ruins, the property of Count Borromeo. In the
15.01 cent. they harboured the ﬁve brothers Mazzarda, notorious
“rounds, the terror of the district. — cmaro (H6t.-P¢m. Nizza;
Auk San Remo; Alb. Carmel-o) is beautifully situated on the sunny
3' llloves of Monte Garza, in the midst of vineyards and orchards.
Beyond it is the little village of Barbe, with its slender campauile.
