268 Route 42. VENICE. History of Art.

Italyﬁﬁlnjpoint of size the early-Renaissance buildings in Venice cannot
compare with those of Tuscany, but they are more richly decorated, and
retain the articulation peculiar to the earliest period. At a later period
Venetian architecture may justly boast of holding out against the rococo
style longer than Central Italy. Chief among Venetian architects were
several of the Lombard! family (immigrants from Carona, on the L 0 di
Lugano), Moro (70de (d. 150A) Jacopo Bansooino of Florence (1488- 570;
see below), Giovanni da Fonts (1512-97), and lastly Andrea Palladio of Vicenn
(151880; p. 243}, who inaugurated a new era, especially in church-archi-

‘tecture, by limiting the facade to a single ran e of massive columns.
Palladio‘s chief successors were Vincenzo Seaman“ 2-1616) and Baldauws
Longhma (1604-75).

In the province of Scunrruas the city possessed at the end of the idth
cent. two important masters in the brothers Kansans, who had probably
studied in the school of the San“ (ca. 1345-75). In the 15th cent. the
growing taste for monumental tombs gave abundant employment to the
sculptors, and led to the execution of those magniﬁcent monuments which
still ﬁll the churches of Venice. The names of the Bum, of Antonio Rina
of Verona (c. 1430-ca. 1498), of the Lombardi (see above), and of Alessandro
Leopards‘ (d. 1522) who had formed himself by the study of Greek sculp-
tures, are the most important. After 1527 Jacopo Samooino, sculptor and
architect, was the leading master. His works, though often designed for
pictorial eﬁ‘ect, are more pleasing than those of Michael Angela‘s school.
Fiis {613? were Girolamo Campagna (1552-1623) and Alessandro Vittoria
( 5 ).

Vsurum Pam-nae did not begin to attract universal attention till
the beginning of the 16th cent. (comp. p. lx). In the 14th cent. it was
far inferior to that of other Italian schools, and though Giotto was en-
gaged in the neighbouring town of Padua, it remained unaffected by his
inﬂuence. In 1365 0mm of Padua, and in 1M9 the Umbrian Gentile do
Fubriano and Vino" Ps'sam of Verona, were invited to Venice to decorate
the doges‘ palace. In the 15th cent. the most noted masters were Giovanni
(also named Alcmanmu), Antonio, Bartolomeo, and Alvin (Luiys‘) Viean'ni,
known as the Alumna“, Jacdpo Bellini, father-in—law of Mantegna, who
inﬂuenced the Paduau school (p. 249), and Carla (ls-teem. Antonella do
Messina introduced painting in oils into Venice about 1473, and the new
method contributed powerfully to the development of the ﬁrst gurely
Venetian artists in Gentile (1427-1507) and Giovanni Bellies (1428-151 ), the
sons of Jawpo. Giovanni Bellini, who had many pupils, is with Mantegna
the most important master of the early Renaissance in N. Italy. Alike in
composition (as in the ‘santa conversazione‘, a peaceful, yet expressive
group of saints with the Madonna), in his love of colour and appreciation
of landscape, and in his conception of female ﬁgures, he may be regarded
as the precursor of the glorious prime of Venetian painting. Among his
contemporaries were Vittors Camaccs‘o (d. 1520), a live 3 pictorial narrator,
and Marco Basal“ (d. 1521), while to his school belonge Oima da Meghan
(1459-1517), Vincmo Galina, Andrea Rama“, Niccolo Rommel“, and others.

The ﬁrst of the reat masters of the late Renaissance was Giorgio“
(Barbarelli, 1477't-151 ), but unfortunately only the altar-piece at Caste!-
t’ranco (p. 257) is thoroughly authenticated as his work; though at Venice
the ‘Famiglia di Giorgione‘ in the Pal. Giovanelli (p. 8%) and an A ollo
and Daphne in the Seminarlo Patriarcale (p. 317) are ascribed to im.
The peculiar glow of his colouring, an attribute which seems natural
rather than acquired, imparts even to his isolated half-ﬁgures unwanted
life and poetical charm. The ﬁrst artist who fully developed that type of
female beauty in which simple enjo nt of life is so admirably ex-
pressed was Jacopa Palma (Vecchia, 1 4598) of Bergamo. The olden
hair of his sitters recalls the fashionable practice of the period of yeing
the hair a light colour. Surpassing all his fellows in celebrity, in fertility,
and in the length of his career, next comes the great Tulane Vncxnu
(1477-1576). Frescoes by him may be seen in the Scuola del Santo and
Scuola del Carmine at Padua and in the Doges‘ Palace at Venice; and
