by the erection of a chateau and the laying out of a garden. The
huge unﬁnished Chateau contains a series of handsome reception-
rooms, a gallery hung with Flemish tapestry of the 17th cent., and
a collection of paintings, mainly copies but including a few good
Lombard works (Boltrafﬁo, Portrait; Gianpietrino, Lucretia and
Cleopatra). The private chapel (adm. by special introduction only)
contains the handsome Renaissance tombs of Counts Camille and
Giovanni Borrnmeo, the latter partly by pupils of Amadeo. — The
beautiful Garden, laid out in the old Italian style, rises in ten terraces
100 ft. above the lake, and is stocked with lemon-trees, cedars,
magnolias, orange-trees, laurels, cork-trees, camellias, magniﬁcent
oleanders, and other luxuriant products of the south, while shell-
grottoes, arbours, and statues meet the eye in profusion. The trav-
eller coming from the N. cannot fail to be struck with the love-
liness of the bank of the lake as seen from here, studded with
innumerable habitations , and clothed with southern vegetation
(chestnuts, mulberries, vines, ﬁgs, olives), the extensive lake with
its deep blue waters and beautiful girdle of snowy mountains
combining the stem grandeur of the High Alps with the charms
of a southern clime. —— The island is open to the public daily, ex-
cept Mon., Wed., and Frid., from March 15th to Nov. 15th, from 9
to 3, 4, or 5 according to the season. A servant shows the apart-
ments (fee 1/2 fr., for a party 1 fr.), and a gardener shows the garden
for a similar fee.

The usual charge for a boat from Isola Bella to Isola Madre and
back with two rowers is 3 fr.

The *Isola Madre (not a steamboat-station), also belonging to
the Borromeo family, is laid out in the English style and far excels
the Isola Bella in the luxuriance and variety of its vegetation. On
its S. side are three terraces with lemon and orange trellises; on
the summit is an uninhabited ‘Paiazzo’ (beautiful view). The island
is open to the public at the same times as the Isola Bella (fee to
gardener 1/2-1 fr.).

Nearly opposite Isola Bella, on the W. bank, lies -—
