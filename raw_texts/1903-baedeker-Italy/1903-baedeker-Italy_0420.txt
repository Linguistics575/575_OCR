266 Route 42. VENICE. History.

The Carnival, which formerly presented a gayer and lighter scene at
Venice than in any other city of Italy, has of late entirely lost its signi-
ﬁcance. -— The city authorities sometimes give Serenades, Ls. concerts with
illuminatious on the Canal Grande. -— The Reyauas held periodically 0n
the Grand Canal are characteristic and interesting. The course is from
the Public Gardens to the Railway Shtion and back to the Pal Foscari.
— The Batu dot Redentors (second Sun. in July) is also interesting.

History. For the early history of Venice, see p. 22). The foundation
of the Eastern supremacy of Venice was laid by Dogs Enrico Dnadok
(1192-1205), who conquered Constantinople in m. In consequence of this
Venice gained possession of numerous places on the coasts of the Adriatic
and the Levant, from Durazso to Trebisond, and of most of the Greek
islands, including Candie, which was administered on the model of the
mother-city. During the conquest and administration of these new terri-
tories there arose a class of nobles, who declared themselves hereditary
in 1297 and excluded the rest of the people from all share in the govern-
ment. The supreme authority lay with the Great Council (Haggtor 0on-
u'ph'o), which consisted of all members of the N066“ above twenty. The
executive was vested in a Dave, or Duke, and six counselldrs, with
whom was associated the Council of the I’t‘eyadt'. The Pregadi were after-
wards united with the higher ofﬁcials to form the Senate. The duty of
the Asengadort dt Gomuue was to see that the public oﬂicials governed
constitutionally. After the conspiracy of Bdamonte Mole (1310) the
chief power was vested in the Council of Ten (Comtgts‘o dot Diccs') elected
yearly by the Maggior Conslglio; and this tribunal, from which t e State
Inquisition was developed in the 16th cent, controlled, in conjunction
with the dogs and his councillors every department of government.

With her rival Genoa the liepublic came repeatedly into violent
conﬂict, losing many of her conquests in the East; but the Genoese were
at length totally defeated by Dog: Andrea Dandolo in 1852. His successor
Merino Fauen‘ plotted for the overthrow of the aristocracy but his scheme
was discovered, and he was beheaded on 17th April, $55 During the
regime of Andrea Contan'm' (1367-82) Padua, Verona Genoa, Hungary, and
Naples formed an alliance against Venice. In 187§ the Genoese captured
Chioggia but they were surrounded in the Lagune and compelled to sur-
render, thh June,1380. Peace was concluded in 381. In 1386 Antonio Vernier
(1382-14(Xl) occupied the island of Corfu, and afterwards Durance, Argos,
etc. Under Michele Elena (1400-1414) the Venetian general Hahtuta con-
?uered Vicenza, Belluno, Feltrc, Rovigo, Verona, and Padua (1405); in
MB the Republic gained possession of Lepanto and Patras, and in 1409 of
Guastalla and Caselmaggiore. In 1421 Tommnsa Hocem'go waged war one
cessfully against Hungary. In 1416 the Venetian ﬂeet under Lorcdan defeated
the Turkish at Gallipoli, and in 14.21 it subdued all the towns of the Dal-
matian coast, so that Venice now held the enﬂre coast from the estuary
of the P0 to the island of Corfu. Mocenigo‘s successor was Francesco Fos-
cart' (1423-57). In 1426 Brescia fell into the hands of the Venetian general
Camagnola (p. ‘7). In 1449 the Venetians took Crema, but were unable
to prevent the elevation of Bforza to the dukedom of Milan (1450). A sad
ending awaited the long and glorious career of Foseari. Suspected by the
Council of Ten, and weakened by contentions with the Loredani and other
private feuds, he was de osed in 1457 and died a few days afterwards. —
Under Crista/ore Moro ( 462-71) the Turks conquered the Korea, where a
few fortresses only were retained by Venice. In 1483 the Republic acquired
Zante, and in 1489 Cyprus also, which was ceded by Catharine Cornaro,
aVenetinn lady, widow of King James of Cyprus.

The 15th cent. witnessed the zenith of the glory of Venice. It rivalled
Bruges as the focus of the commerce of Europe, numbered XX), ..
and was universally respected and admired. The events of 1492 made many
Jews from Granada and other loorish towns seek re e in Venice. Its
annual exports were valued at 10 million ducats I. millions being clear
proﬁt. It possessed 300 sea-going vessels with 8M0 sailors, 3000 mailer
