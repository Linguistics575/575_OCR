Riva (230 it), a busy harbour with 3760 inhab., is charmingly
situated at the N.W. end of the lake, here resembling a fjord, at the
base of the precipitous Bocchetta (4976 ft). 0n the hillside, high
above the town, rises the round tower of a ruined castle supposedto
have been built by the Scaligers. Riva is a sheltered and healthy
place, aﬂording pleasant summer-quarters; the heat is tempered
by the lake, and in the afternoon the town lies in the shadow of
the hills.

The centre of trafﬁc is the piazza at the harbour. The houses
have arcades on the groundﬂoor. At the E. corner is a massive old
clock-tower. Farther to the E. lie the small Piazza Giardino and the
barracks of La Rocca, surrounded by a most, on the site of s castle
of the Scaligsrs. To the N. of the Rocca is the Piazza Brolo, whence ‘
an avenue of palms and magnoliss leads to the E. to the stationgtld
a narrow street to the N., past the Parish Church, to the Comin-
violata, in which is the church of the Inoiolata, a late—Renaissance
cdiﬂce of the 16th century. Thence the road goes on to Arco.

Excunsrons. The Fall of the Ponale is best visited by motor host
(8 times daily, in 20 min.; 5011., there and back 1 K.), landing at the
modest restaurant below the fall. The ‘custode al Ponale‘ exacts ﬂ) h. from
each visitor for opening the shutters in front of the lowest fall. which.
however, is of triﬂing interest. Visitors should ascend past the Bivl
electric works and three other waterfalls to the (20.28 min.) 'Ponals Rodd
(very dusty in summer), which leads high above the like, through a Inca
cessiou of tunnels and cuttings, back to ('/4 hr.) Riva. The boat-trip act
the view from the road are the chief attractions on this ex edition.

A road (omnibus 4 times dsll ) leads from the Ports. an Marco M
wards the N.W. to (3 M.) Varone( ft), with a ﬁne waterfall in a grand
rocky gorge (adm. and electric light 60h.; cloak desirable on account of
the spray). Thence we may proceed either by road to (3 H.) Area (p. 317)!
or on foot, via Cologna, to (1 hr.) Tune (1416 it), with an old castle!
destroyed in 1703) and charming View, and through richly culﬁvlied‘
uplands to Van'anano and (1% hr.) Area (1). 217).

The Monte Brione, 1 hr., to the E of Riva, is accessible by the publit
and atlords an excellent survey of the lake.

The ascent of Ionte Baldo (p. 210), noted for its ﬂora, is interestint
and varied, but somewhat fatiguing in winter on account of the snow, Ind
in summer on account of the heat. This range consists of two groupi.
separated by the depression of the Becca dt' Nasm (4690 ft.): N. the ammo.
and S. the Monte Magaiore. with the C‘t’ma di Val Dn‘tta (7275 ft.) and the
Punta del Telegra/o (7218 (L). The Alias-inn (6790 ft.) is best ascended from
