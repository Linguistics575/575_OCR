past the frequented restaurant (wine) Al Maresciallo, to (5 M.)
Fonda Toes, situated at the mouth of the impetuous Tosa (Tove).
Farther on we pass the granite—quarries of Monte Oriana (2595 ft.)
and then cross the Tosa, by a five-arched bridge, to the railway-station
of Graeellona (p. 182), 6 M. from Pallanza (omnibus, see pp. 177,183).

A road. diverging to the right from the main road at Fondo Toce, leads
to the small Lago di Merger“. originally an arm of the Lego Ma giore,
with which it is now connected only by a narrow channel. From( l], M.)
Hergono (6:0 ft.), on the E. bank, the road ascends the left bank of the
Toss to (Al 2 M.) Oandoglil, noted for its extensive quarries of white marble.
and to (7' 2 M.) Cunago (p.182). Milan Cathedral and part of the Certosa
di Pavia are built of Candoglia marble.

In the S.W. nook of the bay lies Feriolo, 23AM. from Gravellona
(p.182; omn. to Stress, see pp. 180,183). The large granite-quarries
extending along the hills betwaen Feriolo and Baveno have for ages
yielded a splendid building material, which has been used for the
columns in the Cathedral of Milan, the church of San Paolo fuori le
Mara at Rome, the Galleria Vitt. Emanuele at Milan, and many
other important structures. The quarries are worked mainly by the
Della Cara Company, an English enterprize. —— Then —

Bavcno (690 ft.), a small place commanding a fine view of the
bay, is situated on alluvial soil at the mouth of a streamlet descend-
ing from Monte Mottarone (p. 181). It is frequently chosen for a
stay of some time, especially in the warmer months. The Villa Clara,
on the SE. side of the village, was occupied by Queen Victoria
for three weeks in April, 1879, and for a month by the invalid
Crown Prince of Germany (Emp. Frederick 111.) in Oct., 1877 (no
admission).

The most beautiful feature in this W. bay of the lake is formed
by the 'Borromean Islands, the scenery in the neighbourhood of
which rivals that of the Lake of Como in grandeur and perhaps
surpasses it in softness of character. The westernmost, the Isola
Superiore or dei Pesoatori(1‘rattoria del Verbena, plain), is almost
entirely occupied by a ﬁshing-village (300 inhab.), but commands
some picturesque viéws. The steamers touch here only occasionally,
but all of them call at the ——
