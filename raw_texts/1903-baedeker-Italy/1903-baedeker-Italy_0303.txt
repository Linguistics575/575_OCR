To the S. of Intra the Punta Castagnola, with its wealth of
luxuriant vegetation, stretches far into the lake. As soon as we
double the cape and enter the wide W. bay of the lake, we obtain
a 'View of the Borromean Islands (p. 179): near the S. bank is the
Isola Bella, to the W. of it, the Isola dei Pescatori, in front, the

S. bank, with its chapel, house, and garden, is also one of the Bor—
ronean Islands. Behind the Isola dei Pescatori rises the blunt
pyramid of the Mottarone (p. 181); farther to the W. appear the
White quarries near Baveno; while the background is ﬁlled up by
the snow-clad mountains between the Simplon and the Monte Rosa.
