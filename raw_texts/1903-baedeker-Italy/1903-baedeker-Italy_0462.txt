A little to the S. of S. Giovanni in Bragora is the Riva degli

Schiavom’ (p. 283).

We may go towards the E., past San Martino, begun by Sanso-
vino in 1540, completed in 1653 (facade of 1897). Within is a font
with four kneeling angels by Tullio Lombardo, 1484; above the
main entrance, Last Supper by Girolamo da Santa Croce, 1549.
Farther on is the ‘Arsenal (Pl. K, L, 5), founded in 1104 and re-
peatedly enlarged in the 14th, 15th, and 19th centuries. At the
zenith of the Republic it employed 16,000 workmen, but in the
18th cent. 2000-3000 at most, and at present about 3000. At the
entrance rise four famous antique lions, brought from the Piraeus in
1687; the body of the large one on the left bears Runic inscriptions
(by the Normans, 10th cent.?). Handsome Renaissance gateway of
1460. — Admission, see p. 265.

Musnux (cross the court and mount staircase on the left). First ﬂoor:
Interesting collection of models of ships of all periods, including a modd
and the scanty remains of the Bucintoro, a vessel destroyed by the French,
from which the Dogs was wont annually on Ascension Day to throw the
ring (p. 282) into the Adriatic, which he thus symbolically wedded; model
of the system of piles on which the city is to a great extent built (comp.
p. 269). —— Second Floor: Fine collection of weapons; by the entrance, statue
of General Vittore Pisauo (1380), and also two Turkish banners, taken at
Corfu in 1537 and at Lepanto in 1571; armour of the Condottiere Gat-
tamelata (see p. 252), of Henry IV. of France, and of several dogea; re-
volvers and breech-loaders of a primitive description (16th cent); a ﬁnely-

nom; adjacent, to the right, trophies and Turkish banners taken in 1472 at
Friuli. (Explanatory inscriptions on each object; fees ofﬁcially prohibited.)

0n the fagade of the museum are the monuments of Count m der
Schulenburg, marshal in the Venetian service (d. 1717). who directed the
famous defence of Corfu against the Turks in 1716, and of Count Koem'gt-
mnrcb (d. 1688), another celebrated warrior, who conquered the Turks in
the Morea and took Athens in 1887.

We next follow the Rio dell' Arsenale to the S. to the church
of San Biagt‘o (Pl. K, 6), containing the tomb of Admiral Angelo Emo
(see above), by Canova's teacher Ferrari-Torretti. A monument by
Benvenuti, in front of the church (1885), commemorates the ad-
mirable service of the soldiers in the inundation of March, 1882.

The Via Garibaldi leads hence to the ‘Giardini Pubbliei (Pl.
L, M, 6, 7), a pretty park, 20 acres in extent, laid out by Na-
poleon in 1807 on a space obtained by the demolition of several
monasteries. At the entrance from the Via Garibaldi is a bronze
Monument of Garibaldi by Micbieli (1887). In the N.E. corner, on
the Canals di Sant’ Elena, is the Palazzo dell‘ Esposizioue Artisiiea,
erected for the biennial art exhibitions inaugurated in 1895 (p. 264)
