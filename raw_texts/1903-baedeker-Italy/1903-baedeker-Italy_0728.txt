oldest part of the monastery, built in 1215 by St. Francis of Assisi,
and substantially rebuilt after a ﬁre in 1472. Strangers receive good
food and accommodation here, for which a fair recompense is ex-
pected (ladies not admitted). The monks show the extensive con-
vent, the three churches with their excellent reliefs in terracotta of
the school of the Robbie (Annunciation by Andrea della Robbin in
the main church), and the Luoghi San“, a series of grottoes once
frequented by St. Francis. — A path ascends through beautiful
woods to the Penna delta Verna (4166 ft.), also known simply as
l’Apennino, ‘the rugged rock between the sources of the Tiber and
Arno’, as it is called by Dante (Paradise, xi. 106). The celebrated
view from this ridge, now somewhat obscured by trees, is best ob-
tained from the small chapel on the N.W. spur, about 3/4 hr. above
the monastery. — About 1/‘ hr. below the convent, at the end a!
