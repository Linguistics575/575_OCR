The *Gierdini Pubblici (Pl. F, G, 2, 3), between the Corso Venezla
and the Via Manin, are probably the most beautiful public park in
Italy, with their tasteful ﬂower-beds, their ponds, and their pictur-
esque groups of venerable trees. In the older part of the park
(1785), near the new Museo Civico, are bronze statues of Ant.
Stoppani, the geologist (1824-41; by Fr. Confalonieri), and Gen.
Gius. Sirton' [by E. Butti). On a small island in the middle is:
marble statue of the Milanese poet Carlo Porto, by Puttinati. The
W. portion of the park, laid out in 1856, is embellished with I
bronze statue of Ant. Bonnim' (p. 481), by Franc. Confalonierl
(1895). — The high-lying N. portion of the gardens, known as the
Montemerlo, has a Café—Restaurant and a bronze statue of the

taining a few works of art. — In the Via Manin stands the Palauo

i. The Cemeteries.

To the N.W. of the city, outside the Pavia Volta (Pl. 0, D, 1]
and at the terminus of the electric tramway No. 4, mentioned at
p. 113, lies the *Oimitﬁro Monumentule (closed 12-2), designed
by 0. Maciachini, 50 acres in area, enclosed by oolonnades, and one
of the finest ‘campi santi’ in Italy. (The guide, who speaks French,
demands a fee of 11/2 fr. {or each person.) Fine view of the Alps.
The numerous and handsome monuments form a veritable museum
of modern Milanese sculpture. In the last section is situated the
‘Tcmpio di Oremazione‘, presented to the town in 1876 (inspection
permitted).
