Verona (156 ft), the capital of a province, with 78,914 inhsb. _
and a garrison of 6000 men, lies on both banks of the rapid Ad'tye.i
which has been enclosed by high embankments since 1896. A.
fortress of the ﬁrst class, and seat of the commandant of the 3rd
Army Corps, it is the most important and beautiful town of the
Venetian ‘terra ferma’. In 1527 et seq. Verona was surrounded with
new walls and bastions by Sanmicheli. After it came into the pos-
session of the Austrians in 1814 it was again strongly fortiﬁed, and
along with Pesehiera, Mantua, and Legnago formed the famous

fQuadrilateral', the chief support of Austrian rule in Italy until 1866.

Founded by the Rhwtians and Euganeaus, and afterwards occu led by
the Celtic Cenomani, Verona was made a Roman colony in 3.0. . and
became one of the most prosperous towns of Upper Italy. Its castle 91 San
Pietro was a residence of the Ostrogoth Theodore): the Great, the ‘Dletneh
of Bern‘ (Le. Verona) of German lore (d. 528). In 568 the town was taken
by the Lombard king Albot'n, who fell a victim to the vengeance of. his
wife Rosamunde, daughter of the conquered ruler of Verona. whom I“
had forced to drink wine out of her father's skull. The Frankie!) monarch!
