22 M. Casteliranoo Veneto (130 ft; Alb. delta spade, very fair,
and poettily situated, R. 2 in; Alb. Stella d‘Oro; Caﬂ'e del Genie, at
the Spade), a pleasant country-town with 12,440 inhab., in the
centreof which rise the towers and walls of its old castle, shaded by
venerable plane-trees. This town was the birthplace of the painter
Giorgio Barbarelli, snrnamed ll Giorgione (about 1477—1512; comp.
p. 268), a marble statue of whom by Benvenuti adorns the piazza
(1882). Behind the high-altar of the Cathedral is a ”Madonna with
88. Francis and Liberalis by that master (1604; restored); in the
sacristy are frescoes of Justice, Prudence, Time, Fame, and four
Cupids, by Paolo Veronese, early works brought from the Villa
Sormza (painted in 1551).

From Castelfraueo (or from Cornuda, p. 323) a visit may be paid to the
Villa Giacomelli, near Maser, which may be reached b carriage (6-8 fr.)
in 1% hr. (A pleasant détour may be made by Acolo or by anmlo, see below.)
- The 'Villa aims-ell! (formerly Mania; not always open in winter,
when the proprietor is away from home), often called Villa Ilsa» from
the neighbouring village of Maltr, was erected by Palladt'o (106660) and is
celebrated for its ’Frescocs by Paolo Verorme, executed in 1566-68 for the
Venetian patrleian Marcantouio Barbaro, and ranking among the master‘s
best works. They consist of mgthologioal representations and scenes
from social life, grandly conceive , while some of the illusive ﬁgures so
common in the later period of art are introduced. Thus, by the entrance,
I girl and a page, who through a half-opened door apparently watch
the ersnus entering. In the dining-room, upon its fantastically painted
architecture, are seated Ceres with her train and Cupids. The ceiling
of the great hall is decorated with the Councils of the Gods and the
Feast of the Gods on Mount Olympus. Those who wish to obtain a good
idea of a patrician abode of the luxurious 16th cent. should not omit
this excursion. The cha el attached to the villa contains stucco-work by
Al. Vittoria. — About 41 31!. to the W. of Maser, on a prominent ridge a
little above the road to (15 M.) Banana (see below), lies Asolo (Inn), the city

retired on her abdication (p. 286). Catherine retained her title and ‘signed
herself ueen of Cyprus, Jerusalem, and Armenia, and Lady of Asolo. There
she live , dispensing justice, founding a pawnshop for the assistance of
the poor, distributing corn. gratis, in years of distress, listening to the
courtly conversation of Cardinal Bembo, and amusing herself in the gar-
dens of her summer-house on the plain‘ (Horatio F. Brown). The Parish
