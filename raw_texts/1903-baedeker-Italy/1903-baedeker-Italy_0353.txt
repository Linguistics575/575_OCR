climate. Gnrdone is excellently sheltered from the prevalent winter
winds (N. and N.W.) by the chain of hills rising from the 1114. San Bartolo-
meo to the Hts. Pinocolo (see below) and interrupted only by the Barbarano
Ravine. A like service is rendered by the am. Baldo against the E. and
N.E. winds. The S. and SE. winds have free soccss, but the Ora (p. 211)
is not felt here and 83 per cent of the days of the year are free from wind.
The greatest rninfell takes place in Oct. (6.2 in.), Nov. (4.3 in.), And April
(3.3 in.), while the three winter months have usually little rain, abundnnce
of sunshine (129 hrs. in Dec., 1M. in Jan., 165 in Feb.), a. relatively high
temperature (mean 89.5’ Fem-J, and a. low range of temperature (mean
My range in Dec. 9" Fahr., in Jan. 9.5", in Feb. 11.7“). Snow seldom
1m long on the ground. The relative humidity (76 per cent) varies little
and is about the same as that of Montreux.

Gardone-Riviera, consisting of eight villages (Gardens di Sotto,
Gardom disopra, Faaano, etc.), has become since 1886 a favourite
winter-resort for consumptive and nervous invelids, while in the
spring and autumn it is frequented by those in search of rest and
refreshment. The visitors are chieﬂy Germans. The hills siford a.
multitude of varied walks, all free from dust and well provided
nth benches. The vegetation is of a thoroughly southern character
(comp, p. 211); ramellias, magnolias, and palms grow in the gardens

unprotected.
