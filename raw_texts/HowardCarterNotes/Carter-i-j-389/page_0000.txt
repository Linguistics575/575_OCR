Dear Carter:

The enclosed lists cover everything we have in this museum from the Tellev”
of the Kings. I have not attempted to give you detailed descriptions of the
objects until I know just what interests you, but there is enough in the lists,

I believe, for you to pick out what you want to know more about, and then if you
will let me have the numbers I will send you more information, and photographs
if you care for them.

The material is not very important. The Miscellaneous List -- from sources
other than Theo. M. Davis -- is very doubtful stuff. The glass vases said to
be from Amenhotep II and the cup possibly from Rameses II (1.9. from Deir el
Bahri cache) may have come from anywhere; the broken ushsbtis of Seti I are
probably from the Valley, but those of Hent-taui and Ra-ma-ka were, of course,
found with the royal mummies by Maspero.

The gifts of Theo. M. Davis are in all cases what he thought was rubbish --
and some of it is. He gave outright to the Boston Museum a lot of good glazes
from Thhtmosie IV and a chair arm, the box and leather garments of Miherpri
and the eercOphagus of ThutmOsis I. The stuff he gave to us was really given
by Harold Jones and Burton. The most important of the stuff is the cache found
by Ayrton near the Engine Tomb on which I have always intended to write an article.
