America another your I shall surely try to do somgthing on it. In the mean time
let me know what I can do to help you in regard to it. You might, if you are
in Cairo, see if you can run down the mask,(see page 6 of list) seid to_be_frog_‘

.—

this find of pottery, and if you find it I would be very much obliged for a
description of it end its Livre d'Entrée number.

In regard to the Davis private collection we do not yet know whether the
will will stand and whether it will come to us or not. I am sending you a list
of everything we can find that still remained in his passession at the time of
his death. As you will see it is practically all published well enough -- but
if there is anything more you want to know about those things which are on loan
here write soon in case the will is broken and the collection scattered.
Unfortunately we have no photographs of loan material.

If I can do anything in Boston for you I will be glad to as I shall be
near there in August and September.

Best luck to you,

Sincerely,
