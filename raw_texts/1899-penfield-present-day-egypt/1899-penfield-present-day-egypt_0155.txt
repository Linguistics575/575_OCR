Present-Day Egypt

The khedive, khedival family, and palace expenses,
coming under the head of “civil list,” call for
$1,159,000. In ordinary times the army and mili-
tary police cost $2,390,000, and civil and military
pensions $2,150,000 more.

Nearly half of the sum required to carry on the
Egyptian government is produced by direct taxa-

municipal octroi on food and merchandise, stamp
duties, receipts from railways, post-oﬂices, tele-
graphs, lighthouses, and courts of justice. The
sale of salt and natron gives a yearly revenue of
nearly $8,000,000.

effective in the immediate future, is the adjustment
of inequalities in the land-tax. By the old scheme
of estimating values many anomalies were coun-

chose to demand. Not until Khedive Tewﬁk’s
reign was a receipt of any kind given the peasant
to show that he had paid his taxes and that no
