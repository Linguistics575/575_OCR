THE EXPANSION or Pnonucrrvn EGYPT BY IRRIGATION

EB most interesting page in the modern his-
tory of Egypt is that which records the de-
velopment of scientiﬁc irrigation.

Coincident with the preparation of this volume
for publication, one of the most stupendous en-

of water perhaps a hundred and ﬁfty miles long,
crossing the tropic of Cancer, and extending south-
ward nearly to Korosko,—a goodly step on the jour-
may to Abu-Simbel and Wady-Halfa,—by means
of a great dam across the Nile at Assuan. The
Pyramids and the Sphinx have borne testimony
through the centuries to the grandeur and power of
execution which dwelt within the Nile valley; and
what more ﬁtting now than that the same valley
should be the theater of a gigantic engineering ex-
ploit, audacious perhaps, but certain of success, and
ministering to man’s necessities, rather than to his
vanity?

As a wholesale rearrangement of nature’s surface
the project outranks anything hitherto attempted
