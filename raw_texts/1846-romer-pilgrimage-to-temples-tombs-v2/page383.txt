370 DEPARTURE.

draws to a close, and with regret I remember,
that at this hour to-morrow I shall be many miles
away from it,—-never again, in all human proba-
bility, to behold this pearl of Oriental cities.
Many circumstances have conspired to render
our stay here delightful, and not the least among
them has been the unexpected arrival of some
of the most agreeable of our travelling acquaint-
ance, almost in the same moment with ourselves,
——some coming from the ruins of Jerash, some
from Cairo, others from Jerusalem. To—morrow
we all disperse in the various directions of
Palmyra, Aleppo, Egypt by the desert, and
Baalbec, (which latter is our destination.) God
knows whether we ever shall meet again; but if
not, and that these pages should ever reach their
eyes, they will learn, that among those gracious
incidents which have contributed to enhance
the pleasures of a tour where there has been so
much to enjoy, and so little to regret, few have
been more truly appreciated by me, than these
pleasant snatches of social intercourse with kindred
and courteous spirits, which have recurred in
the far solitudes of the Nile, in the bustle of
Cairo, amid the pilgrim scenes of Jerusalem, and
in the garden courts of Damascus!
