Damascus, April 28, 1846.

IVE departed for Tiberias on the 19th, under
the escort of a Bedouin, and with an addition to our
cavalcade, one of our saddle mares having foaled
at Nazareth. The pretty little new-born crea-
ture was made to trot after its mother in the com-
mencement of that day’s journey, but as it would
inevitably have perished of fatigue had such
a course been pursued, I insisted upon a more
humane arrangement being made for it; and one

of our Druse muleteers was accordingly mounted
on a donkey, and carried the foal in his lap.
