ARMENIAN CONVENT. 243

the most exquisite doors inlaid with ivory, mo-
ther-of—pearl, Silver, and tortoise-shell, of pictures,
and antique enamels representing Scriptural sub-
jects, of chandeliers and silver lamps, together
with the splendid accessories of the priests’
dresses, (for they were celebrating one of their
great religious ceremonies when we arrived, and
the church was crowded with pilgrims,) presented
the most brilliant and interesting coup d’aez'l. The
Armenians possess the ﬁnest garden in Jerusalem;
indeed everything belonging to them bears the
stamp of wealth, solidity, and decorum; and the
very cats that were feeding at the convent gates
looked sleek and canonical like the monks them-

selves.
