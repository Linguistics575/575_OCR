CONTEMPLATED DEPARTURE. 129

grims) from Mecca, which takes place next month,
and is attended with great solemnities and re-
joicing, I should have betaken myself to the Great
Desert on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. But
the intolerable suspense and anxiety into which
the irregularity of my correspondents has thrown
me is no longer to be borne, and I must go and
obtain in person the intelligence which those
most dear to me have failed to send me. Now
this is provoking, but it is inevitable ; for as I do
not possess the philosophy that wraps itself up in
the comfortable conviction of “no news being
good news,” I shrink from the idea of dragging
after me a lengthening chain of anxiety into more
remote regions.

Still, I shall quit Cairo with reluctance, and
with many regrets, not merely for the place itself,
but for some of the persons it contains, by whom
much kindness has been shown to me, and with
whom many pleasant hours have been passed.
Some of them I may hope to see in Europe, but
others are more exclusively bound to the East,
and the chances are against my ever meeting
them again. I only wish they could understand
that the sole drawback to the pleasure their
acquaintance has conferred upon me has been the
knowledge that I must so soon relinquish it.
