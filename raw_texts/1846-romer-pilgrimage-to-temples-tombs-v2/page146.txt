SHEIKH AHMED. 133

Pray taste that excellent glass bottle?” I dared

not.

When he took his leave, the irrepressible spirit
of the Arab broke forth. He had got half-way
down the staircase when he suddenly turned
round, and running back to my room asked me if
I had not got an old handkerchief, or a riband, or ‘
a pair of gloves, or, in short, magi/Ling to give
him as a souvenir of me! I gratiﬁed him by
rummaging in my drawers and giving him some
triﬂe from thence; and after thrusting it into his
bosom, kissing my hand, and then carrying it to
his forehead, he departed in high glee, chuckling
to the gentleman who had introduced him, “ Now
when that lady either speaks or writes of me to
her friends in England, she will be sure to say,
Sheikh Ahmed is a beggarly old fellow!”
