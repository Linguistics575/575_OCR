their carpetted shop-boards, dreamily running
their ﬁngers over the beads of their Mecca
Chaplets, or inhaling the cold fragrance of their
bubbling narghiles; the sweetmeat vendors,
hawking about their trays of tempting goods,
in the shape of rose-leaf tarts, preserved 7722297;
772537163 (apricots), lumps of delight, consolation
to the throat, and a dozen varieties of Izalva,
(507% 120723,) all equally good; the ice-sellers, with
little pails of frozen cream, and large water
jars with a lump of snow from Lebanon closing
the spout,——all these, mixed up with wild-looking
dervishes and still wilder-looking Bedouins from
the neighbouring country of the Haouran, form
a tout 67236772516 which has not its parallel in any
other place. The far—famed blades of Damascus
are no longer manufactured here, and are even
rarely to be found in the bazaars ; but its saddlery
is still famous, and it is celebrated for its
gold and silver tissues, and the striped silk and

cotton stuffs which form so prominent a part
in the costume of the Caireens, as well as of
the inhabitants of Syria. Unset precious stones
are also found here in plenty, especially pearls
and turquoises; and every sort of gold and sil-
ver trimming is to be had better and cheaper in
Damascus than in any other place in the East.
