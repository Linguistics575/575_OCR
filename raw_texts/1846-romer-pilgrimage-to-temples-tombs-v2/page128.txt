PETRIFIED FOREST. 115

generally asserted that the roots of all these trees
point towards the Red Sea, and the summits
towards Egypt, as though a hurricane or inun-
dation from the former direction had uprooted
and prostrated them. But this is not exactly
the case, and a certain chaotic confusion among
the fragments shows that the shock which over-
threw them produced less regularity than has
thus been attributed to it.

At some remote period, therefore, it is evident
that the desert tract, which does not now pro-
duce a blade of grass, was covered with waving
forests; but what awful and mysterious caprice
of Nature transmuted those towering trunks into
stone, and converted the once fertile soil into a
barren waste? The mind becomes bewildered in
endeavouring to resolve this question; we have
no data to go by—no chronicle exists which
alludes to this mighty transformation! For
myself, in ignorant humility, I dared not even
to form a suggestion concerning the cause, and
contented myself with wondering at, and admir-
ing, the reﬂects, while I collected some specimens
of agatized wood to add to the little store of
tangible souvenirs of my wanderings in the Land
of Egypt which I have already amassed. The

ride to the Petriﬁed Forest is a very agreeable
