GIRLs’ SCHOOL. 53

the afternoon learn sewing and embroidery. The
language taught is Arabic, but a few learn Eng-
lish also, and all receive instruction in the
Christian Catechism. They are taught reading,
writing, keeping accounts, plain work, embroi-
dery, washing and ironing, and such useful and
homely branches of education as enable them
to take the direction of an establishment when
they marry, upon a very different footing to that
maintained by the untutored females of Maho-
metan countries,— or to earn their livelihood by
their own industry, should they remain with their
parents.

The Lancastrian school is conducted in every
part as in England, and is under the immediate
direction of a Syrian woman, a Christian from
Mount Lebanon, whom lVIr. Lieder declares to
have been his right hand in the original forma-
tion of the schools; ﬁve of the pupils of the
high class assisting by turns as monitors under
her. The children commence with the alphabet,
and advance step by step until they can read
portions of the Scriptures from the lesson-book.
Every day part of Dr. VVatts’s Catechism is read
to them, which they are required to repeat, and
thus the whole is progressively committed to

their memory.
