356 ORIENTAL WOMEN.

were fastened at the side of her taréoos/L, and a
great many rows of pearls encircled her throat and
arms. She told me that she would give the world
to dress in the European fashion, and fell into
ecstacies with my straw bonnet and the jet
buttons of my black dress.

These, then, are the two beauties, par excellence,
of a city famous for the beauty of its women ! and
yet I do not exaggerate in averring that any
moderate-sized ball-room in London or Paris
would exhibit at least twenty far lovelier faces.
As to forms, I dare not venture to proffer a
similar declaration, for it is impossible to ascer-
tain what the ﬁgure of an Eastern woman really
is. The Oriental garb is so contrived as to dis-
guise the beautiful outline of shoulders, bust,
and waist, which are such peculiarly feminine dis-
tinctions; and it is generally so ill-fitted to the
person, that, even should a woman’s ﬁgure be
faultless, all the merits of such perfection would
be lost under the huddled effect of garments
which look as if they had been bought at a ready
made clothes shop, without ever having been
tried on. All that you can precisely ascertain
about an Eastern woman’s form is, whether or
not she has pretty hands and arms and small
feet, whether she is tall or short, slender or fat.
