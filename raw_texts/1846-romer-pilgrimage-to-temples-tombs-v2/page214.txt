CALVARY. 201

having duly noted each, you are conducted up
a ﬂight of eighteen steep marble steps, and told
that you are upon Calvary. There is something
in that name that forbids—or mag/at to forbid-—
the possibility of a ﬂippant remark being made
in conjunction with it; and if an irreverent idea
should suggest itself as to the startling fact of
ﬁnding the sites of our Saviour’s Passion ar-
ranged as in a familiar dwelling-house, upon the
ﬁrst and second ﬂoor, it must quickly be re-
pelled by the knowledge that, gf not there, at
some place not far removed, the great act of
man’s redemption was sealed with the blood
of Christ. I envy not the feelings that could
ﬁnd room for aught else at such a moment;
and so entirely was I absorbed by that thought
alone, that when I bent down in order that I
might enter the low Space beneath the altar
which occupies the extremity of the chapel upon
Calvary, and that I knelt to examine the socket
beneath it, said to be the identical one in which
the Cross was planted, the strong emotion that
swelled my heart to suffocation overﬂowed at
my eyes; and tears of humility, of contrition, of
thankfulness, fell fast from them upon the spot
which had perhaps been moistened with the pre-

cious blood that was shed to wash away our sins.
