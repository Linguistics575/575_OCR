388 THE LEBANON.

none of that romantic beauty of scenery that
might be expected from the sublime aSpect of the
mountain chain, as seen from the sea-shore of
Beyrout, or from the plains of Sidon and Tyre.
Barren rocks and gloomy gorges, lighted up by
a scorching sun,—scarce1y any villages, and those
of the meanest description,—miserable khans,
which we avoided as we would have done “the
plagues of Egypt,” were all that met our eyes.
Our ears, however, were occasionally soothed by
the sound of Christian bells from some far off
convent; and I can scarcely describe the effect
which the sound of the “squilla lontana,” so
long unheard, produced upon me in these wild
solitudes.

After two days and a half journeying through
the most terriﬁc roads I ever yet encountered,
(roads did I say? rocks is the word I) we were
safely deposited in Beyrout. The thrill of almost
wondering thankfulness with which I dismounted
at the door of Bianchi’s hotel made me sud—
denly sensible that I had scarcely hoped to have
returned thither alive. Indeed, to the precautions
of our dragoman Mohammed (who walked every
step of the way across the Lebanon, in order that
he might lead my mule) do I wholly attribute
the preservation of my limbs, if not of my life.
