40 COPT WEDDING.

being held. As the family is a very wealthy one,
and that a double marriage was celebrated (that
of the son and that of the daughter of the house),
everything was on a scale of great magniﬁcence
and liberality. \Ve found the interior court of
the dwelling brilliantly illuminated with tier
suspended over tier of large chandeliers, producing
the effect of a tree of light, and literally crowded
with male guests. In the midst of them were
seated the famous musicians of Cairo, who are
so admirably delineated in one of the wood-cuts
of Mr. Lane’s “ Modern Egyptians,” performing
a concert upon all of their incongruous instru-
ments, dulcimers, cocoa-nut ﬁddles, Arab ﬂutes,
&c., in a way to drive an Italian maestro “ clear
demented,” and certainly not in a way to impress
me with the correctness of their musical taste.
Noise, and not harmony, or even melody as
understood by us, appeared to be their aim; and I
was very glad to escape from their vicinity, and
to be conducted by the master of the house to

the apartments on the ﬁrst ﬂoor, where all the
élz‘te of the male guests were assembled (for al—
though the Copts are Christians, their women
live in as strict seclusion from the male part of
the community as Mahometan females, and veil

their faces as completely out of doors).
