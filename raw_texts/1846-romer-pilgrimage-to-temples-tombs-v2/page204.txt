the Virgin fainted when she beheld her son led
out to die.” —“ This is Veronica’s house,” “There
is the mark produced by the Cross striking against
the wall, when Jesus fell to the ground under
its weight! 850. &c.” And yet we know that
within a century after the death of our Saviour,
the arch, the gateway, the house, the wall,.the

been preserved when Hadrian rebuilt the city;
