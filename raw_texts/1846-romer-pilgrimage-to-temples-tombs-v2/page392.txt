RUINS or BAALBEC. 37 9

from us, to the left, towered the glorious ruins
of Baalbec!

Perhaps the most favourable moment for be-
holding these ruins is sun-rise, when the earliest
beams of the God of Day seem so lovingly to
greet the remains of his once proud sanctuary,
that column, capital, and colonnade gradually
blush into the softest rosy hues as the clinging
light spreads over them. To us, at least, our ﬁrst
view of them at that hour appeared so sublime,
that we could imagine nothing to surpass it.
Monsieur de Lamartine has recorded his ﬁrst

impressions on the same spot in language as

forcible as it is happy: “ Le silence est le seul
langage de l’homme, quand ce qu‘il éprouve
dépasse la mesure ordinaire de ses impressions.”
\Ve, however, were not struck dumb by what
we beheld; those who have seen Karnak can
never again be overwhelmed by any fabric formed
by human hands!

Baalbec presents a mass of ruins of which the
famous Temple of the Sun constitutes only a
part. Three distinct epochs of architecture are
evident; the most recent is Saracenic, preceded
by Roman, and both are superimposed upon an
artiﬁcial platform of a period unknown, but
surmised to date from the time of Solomon.
