WOLVES. 331

delay as possible, and to regain the track from
which we had so widely diverged. \Ve had
nothing to guide us but the setting sun, and we
rode briskly on in the hope of ﬁnding water (that
indispensable adjunct to a night bivouac) before
darkness should overtake us. lVe were so for-
tunate as to reach a stream just as the sun had
sunk beneath the horizon; and with joy we
perceived near it the traces of a ﬁre having re-
cently been made there. It was evident that
travellers had lately passed by; we felt that we
were not quite in a deserted country: however,
the only living things we descried were a couple
of wolves, which we disturbed in their evening
prowl; they bounded off beyond gunshot of us,
and having attained an eminence at some distance,
turned round to examine us at their leisure, and
then disappeared, and we saw no more of them.
\Ve pitched our tents on the banks of the
stream, and sent off two of our men in quest
of human habitations. In about an hour and a
half they returned accompanied by two Bedouins
belonging to a tribe encamped not far off, who
brought us some milk in a bladder, and remain—
ed to guard us during the night. From these
men we learned the extent of the error into

which we had been led by our Druse muleteer.
