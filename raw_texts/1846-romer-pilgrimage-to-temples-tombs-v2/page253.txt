240 THE GREEK PATRIARCH.

part of the Greek convent of Jerusalem, and re-
ceived us with all the courtesy and all the cere-
mony incidental to Oriental visits. He is a
handsome and digniﬁed-looking old man, a native
of the Fanar (the Greek quarter of Constanti-
nople), and speaks nothing but Greek and Turk-
ish. Pipes, coffee, sweetmeats, and sherbet were
served to us in abundance, and our reverend host
offered us all sorts of courteous attentions for
the approaching fétes of the Greek Holy \Veek
(which this year falls exactly one week later than
that of the Catholics); but, as we shall leave J e-
rusalem immediately after the Latin celebration
of the Passion, we cannot proﬁt by his willingness
to oblige us in that particular. Had it depended
upon his own volition alone, the Patriarch assured
me that I should have had free permission to visit
the monastery of Santa Saba; but the order
which excludes all womankind from its walls is
imperative, and admits of no exceptions what-
ever, or of any rights of favour being exercised,
even by the Patriarch himself. Such an argu-
ment was unanswerable, and I was afterwards
consoled for my disappointment by being assured
that the refusal of admission to Santa Saba had
spared me several hours’ additional riding over the
most execrable roads even in Palestine.
