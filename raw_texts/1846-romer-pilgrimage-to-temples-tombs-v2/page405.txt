390 CONCLUSION.

tion to me to the latest moment of my eX-

istence.
If I have only succeeded in imparting to you

a tithe of the interest which I have myself ex-
perienced, my gratiﬁcation will not be quite so
selﬁsh as the foregoing sentence would infer; and
I shall dofl‘ mypilgrim weeds, and hang up my
pilgrim’s staff, with the gracious reﬂection, that
my wanderings have not been made in vain.

But I am hopeless of such a result—for it is
an undeniable truth, (and lay it to your minds,
0 ye dwellers at home! who only become ac-
quainted with the varieties of your fellow-man
through the medium of books,) that, be the pages
you pore over ever so eloquent, or the reﬂections
they contain ever so arousing, “2'! 3/ a plus de
philosophic dam cent [ileum d6 carat-am, qzce dams
