rhinoceroses! and I was nearly washed out of
my saddle last night as I returned to Bianchi‘s
Hotel from dining at Colonel Rose’s,—for I was
obliged to ride there and back, no carriages
existing at Beyrout, and even if they did,
no streets being wide enough to admit of
their circulation. I inquired of Mrs M., the
prettiest and most elegant woman in the Levant,
how she manages here during the season of balls
and fétes, and learned that she possesses the
treasure of a sedan-chair, which effectually shields
the draperies of the fair Consulessa from being,
“ visited too roughly by the winds of Heaven.”
Adieu! we start to—morrow, and long before
this letter reaches you, we shall have reached

the Holy City !
