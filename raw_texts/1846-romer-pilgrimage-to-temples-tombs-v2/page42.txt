OBELISK. 29

obelisk stands in a garden full of rosemary and
other fragrant herbs (but I could discover none
of the balsam for which Materieh was formerly
famous); and standing beneath the shadow of
this lonely monument, I in vain looked around me
for some other trace of the famous City of the
Sun where Joseph dwelt, and where Moses be-
came “learned in the wisdom of the Egyptians.”
All is now a level blank, and the words of pro-
phecy have been illustrated to the letter in On,
as in Noph and No,—the pomp of Egypt is
destroyed, and she is destitute of that of which
she was full !
