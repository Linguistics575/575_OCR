TEMPLE OF THE SUN. 383

blocked up for long ages, I espied a low aperture
in the wall, half masked with wild brambles,
through which I crept, and found myself standing
before the great gateway. It is twenty-five feet
high, and twenty wide, and is admirably sculp—
tured all round with broad bands of the most

delicate ornaments in a wonderful state of pre-
servation, and the interior of the upper part re-
presents an eagle with outspread wings—not the
eagle of imperial Rome, but the Eastern eagle

dedicated to sun-worship—grasping in its talons
a caduceus, and holding in its beak a ribbon,
the ends of which, streaming to the right and
to the left, are supported by two ﬂying ﬁgures
of Fame. The soflit containing this beautiful
sculpture is composed of three blocks, the centre
one of which has been displaced by earthquake,
and has fallen several feet below the other two,
where it remains suspended, and appears to
menace the head of whomsoever attempts to cross
the threshold. The roof of the temple has com-
pletely disappeared: the interior still preserves
some ﬁne pilasters, with niches between them,
which were doubtless destined to contain the
statues of the gods; and their elaborate embel-
lishment is in perfect harmony with the other
portions of this once splendid sanctuary.
