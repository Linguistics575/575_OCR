HAFIZA. 109

although she has attained the age which is more
than maturity in this part of the world. As
soon as I could ﬁnd an opportunity, I whispered
my eager inquiries to Mrs. Lieder; but that
lady had never heard of the romantic episode
in Selim Pasha’s life, and could give me no
lights upon the subject. The inviolable privacy
of Eastern life admits of none of those gossiping
details, which in Europe lay bare the secrets
of the domestic hearth to the heartless curiosity
and the cold comments of the community at
large; and many an incident of thrilling and
even tragic interest passes here, unknown to all
save the immediate actors in the scene. In
a country like Egypt, where no man ventures
to inquire even of his dearest friend after the
health of his wife, or indeed to make any allusion
to her at all in direct terms, this is easily un-
derstood, and I was therefore by no means sur-
prised at Mrs. Lieder’s ignorance of the subject
I have alluded to: but in my own mind I was
satisﬁed that our amiable hostess was no other
than the beautiful Haﬁza, bestowed long years
ago by Mohammed Ali upon his favourite Selim
as a bride; and my convictions were strengthened
when I heard her speak of her brother in terms
of the strongest attachment.
