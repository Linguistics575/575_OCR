their having only found an empty sarcophagus
there, has left mankind still in doubt as to
whether that room had been the real depository
of the royal remains; but might not earlier
depredators have found their way there, and
having riﬂed the tomb, closed up the entrance
so effectually as to elude detection?

I believe that, even now, there are many
persons who entertain the belief that these dis-
covered passages were originally made only as
a blind to mislead intruders, and that the secret
object of the Pyramids still lies undiscovered in
the \direction of the descending passage; and
below the chamber, No.16, called the rock
chamber, beyond which exists a horizontal
passage, No. 17, to the extent of fifty-two feet,
where there is a well, which was explored by
Colonel Howard Vyse without any result. Some,
I believe, would even go so far as to maintain
that the sacred chamber was sunk sufﬁciently
deep in the rock upon which the pyramid is
based, to bear out the opinion that Herodotus
gathered from the Egyptian priests of his day,—
a hearsay evidence, perhaps, rashly advanced by
the Father of History,-—that the Pharaoh’s body
lay in an insulated subterraneous chamber beneath
