DR. ROBINSON’S WORK. 317

things is evident, but mixed up with tastes more
profane, and the pilgrim and the jockey are
curiously blended in the pages of his highly-
coloured work. But Dr. Robinson’s book is
a ﬁne, healthy, dispassionate piece of prose,—
a manly and perspicuous View of a debateable
subject, where you are not entrapped by the
seductions of language or the charm of imagina-
tion to take the author‘s view of his argument,
but where you are struck by the candour, the
reasoning powers, the deep research, and the
admirable Christian spirit with which he treats
the question, and are led to dive into the argu-
ment as he has done, to weigh all its pros and
cons, and to endeavour to throw upon them the
noon-day light of dispassionate investigation,

instead of the clear obscure of poetical reveries.
Adieu !
