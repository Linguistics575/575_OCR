TICKETS on ADMISSION to the antiquities, see p. 184. — As

Shella‘l (Philae) is not yet united by railway with Wadi Halfa, visitors
to Lower Nubia are dependent upon steamboats or dahabiyehs. The
journey by land, on camels or donkeys, is fatiguing and by no
means recommended.

, Steamboats. — Cook’s tourist-steamer Prince Abbas, starting
every Monday from the end of December to the beginning of March,
plies from Shellal to wadi Halfa and back in 7 days (fare, incl. board,
30L, for Cook’s passengers 23L). Though the steamer halts at a
few points only, its passengers have an opportunity of securing a
fairly adequate idea of the scenery and antiquities of Nubia.

The itinerary of this voyage is as follows: -—

13! Day (Monday). Start from Shellal (Philae) at 10 am. Via
Debét, Kertassi, Bab el—Kalabsheh, and Kalabsheh to Dendﬁr.
Visit to the temple there.

2nd Day. Via Gerf—Husén to Dakkeh, where the temple is
visited; thence to Sebﬁ‘a and Korosko.

3rd Day. In the morning ascent of the Awas el-Guarani. The
steamer starts at 10 am. for ‘Amada (inspection of the temple).
Derr, Ibrim, and Abu-Simbel.

4th Day. From Abu-Simbel to Wadi Halfa.

5th Day. Excursion by land to the Second Cataract. The steamer
starts at noon for the return to Abu-Simbel, where the temples are
visited.

6th Day. Start at 10 am. from Abn-Simbel for Derr (short in-
8pection of the temple) and Maharalga (inspection of the temple).

7th Day. Via Kalabsheh (inspection of the temple) to Shellal,
arriving at 4 p.m., in time for the train to Assuan.

GOVERNMENT STEAMERS also ply between Shellal and Wadi Halfa.
These vessels are fairly comfortable, but the rapidity of the voyage
(80 hrs. up, 30 hrs. down) leaves little time to visit the antiquities.
