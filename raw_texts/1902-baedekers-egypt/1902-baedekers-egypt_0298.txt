M‘13. Wooden Statue from Sakkara, known as the Shélch el-Beled
(village-chief), a name given to it by the Arabs on account of its
resemblance to a well-fed specimen of that modern functionary.

The feet, which had been broken off, are restored, but the rest of
the ﬁgure is in its original condition. The arms are separately worked
and attached to the body. The upper part of the body and the legs are
bare, while from the hips hangs a kind of apron folded in front. In the
hand is the long rod of ofﬁce. The round head with its short hair, and
the portrait-like, good-natured face are remarkably lifelike. The eyes
were put in. They consist of pieces of opaque White quartz with pupils
formed of rock-crystal, and they are framed with thin plates of bronze,
the edges of which form the eyelids.
