dancers, jugglers, and showmen of every kind crowd the town. A
number of European merchants are also to be met with.

From ri‘anta to Mehallet R2211, Marmara, and Damietta, see pp. 159, 160.

A branch-line runs from Tanta to the 8. via Shibm el-Kdm, a small
town on this side of the Rosetta. branch of the Nile, to (26 M.) Menaf, the
central point of the Menﬂfiyeh, one of the most fertile regions in the Delta,
and to (381/2 M.) Ashmzm.

Tania is also the starting-point of several LIGHT RAILWAYS: —- 1. Via
Bermd (p. 22) and Basyﬂn (9000 inhab.; 3 M. to the S.E. of 5d el-Hagar
and the ruins of Sails; comp. p. 22) to Shin (Chine), and thence vial Sakha
and Nemret eZ-Basal to Meflallet el-Kobra (Melzallet el-Kebir; p. 159). -—
2. Via. Damat to Kotzlr, whence it is to be prolonged to MeZlallet eI-Kobra
(p. 159). — 3. To Kafr ez-Zm‘ydt (see p. 22).

Beyond Tanta the train traverses a fertile tract, and beyond
(87 M.) Bg‘ﬂcet es—Sab‘a (branch—line to Zifteh, see p. 159) crosses
a small arm of the Nile. A number of cotton—cleaning mills afford
an indication of the wealth of the country. Beyond Kuesna, near
Benha, on the Damietta arm of the Nile, is a large viceregal palace,
where ‘Abbas I. died in 1854 (probably by violence). —- The train
crosses the Damietta branch of the Nile.

101 M. Benha. (railway to Zakézik and the Suez Canal, see
p. 161), or Benha’l—‘Asal, Le. ‘Benha of the honey’, is famous for its
blood-oranges and mandarius, which are much esteemed at Cairo.
Excellent grapes are also produced here.

To the N.E. of Benha, not far from the town, and intersected by the
railway, are the insignificant ruins of the ancient Athribis, now named
K6175 eZ-Atrib and Atrib or Etrt‘b. Athribis was founded under the Pharaohs,
and appears to have enjoyed its maximum importance in the Graaco-Roman
period of Egyptian history. — A short branch-line (trains daily) leads to
(7 M.) Mil Berah, and a. light railway runs to Man§0ra and the Barrage
du Nil (see p. 158).

Near (109 M.) Talc}: the mountains enclosing the Nile higher
up become visible in the distance. The outlines of the pyramids
then begin to loom in the distance on the right. —— Stat. Kaha

1201/2 M. Kalyﬁb (Calioub) is the junction of a branch-line to
Zalcd-zilc (p. 161) and of another to the (51/2 M.) Barrage du Nil

The leyan cha1n becomes more d1st1nctly v1s1ble, and we
also observe the Mokattam range with the citadel, and the mosque
of Mohammed rAli with its slender minarets. The scenery now
becomes more pleasing. Gardens and villas come in sight. To the
left lie the site of the ruins of Heliopolis (the obelisk of which is
not seen from the railway), Matariyeh with its sycamores, Kubbeh,
the usual residence of the Khedive, and the large barracks of rAb—
basiyeh, while on the right we perceive the beautiful avenue lead—
ing to Shubra (p. 76). About 3/4 hr. after leaving Benha the train
enters the principal station of (129 M.) Cairo (p. 24).
