lxxxii HISTORY.

Makeré-Hatshepsowet, queen and builder of
the temple of Der el-bahri (p. 278). reigned alter-

Thutmosis II. nately.

Thutmosis 111. (1515-1461 B.C.)

After the death of his sister and brother -—-

Thutmosis III. reigned alone. He was one of the most notable Egypt—
ian kings, recaptured Syria, and established the inﬂuence of
Egypt in W. Asia. His rock—tomb is at Biban e1-Mulﬁk(p. 276).

Amenophis II. (Amenhotep; 1461—1436 B.C.); rock—tomb at Biban
el—Muluk (p. 276).

Thutmosis IV. (1436-1427 B.C.) excavated the Sphinx at Gizeh
(p. 123).

Amenophis III. (1427-1392 B.C.), whose wife was named TeyE,
maintained intercourse withthe kings ofBabylon, Assyria, Mitani
(on the upper Euphrates). etc. (see cuneiform tablets from Tell
e1—'Amarna, p. 94), and built temples in Nubia, Luxor, Medinet
Habu(Colossi ofMemnon), and elsewhere. His tomb is at Biban
el—Mulﬁk (p. 277).

Amenophis IV. (1392—1374 B.C.) endeavoured to replace the old
religion by the worship of a single deity, viz. the sun, an
endeavour perhaps to provide a god that should be worshipped in
common by all the peoples ofthe extensive empire (p. cxxii). The
movement was probably instigated by the priests of Heliopolis
and was directed at ﬁrst only against the gods of Thebes, who,
during the New Empire, had thrown all others into the shade.
Many of the ancient deities, especially those of Thebes, were
fanatically ‘persecuted’, their images and names being removed
from all monuments. For his own original name, in which the
name of Ammon occurs, the king substituted that of EIch-en-aton
or Spirit of the Sun. Tell el—‘Amarna (p. 203), near which is the
kings tomb (p. 209), was made the capital instead of Thebes.
After the death of Amenophis internal commotions broke out
and the recently introduced‘religion was again abolished.

Among his successors (1374—1350 B.C.) were Eyé (tomb at Biban
el-Mulﬁk, p. 277) and Tut-enkh-Amon, who transferred the
royal residence back to Thebes.

Harma'is (Haremheb), who restored peace, is the virtual founder of

Sethos I. (S)etoyei) fought against the Libyans, Syrians, and the Hit-
tites (Kheta), a powerful people that under the 18th Dyn. had
penetrated from Asia Minor into N. Syria and threatened the
Egyptian possessions in Syria and Palestine. Sethos built large
temples at Karnak, Kurna, and Abydos. His tomb is at Biban
el-Muluk (p. 271); his mummy at Gizeh (p. 80).
