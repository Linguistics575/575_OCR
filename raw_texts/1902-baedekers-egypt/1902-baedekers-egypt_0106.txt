HISTORY.

Louis IX., the Saint, of France undertook the Sixth Crusade,
marched against Egypt, took Damietta, but was captured
along with his army at Mansura, and was only released
on payment of a heavy ransom (p. 158).

BAHRITE MAMELUKE SULTANS. The ﬁrst of these monarchs
was Mu'izz Eibelc.

Bibars, one of the ablest of this dynasty, annihilated the last
remnants of the kingdom of Jerusalem in the course of
four campaigns. He brought to Cairo the last representa-
tive of the rAbbaside khalifs, who had been overthrown by
the Mongols and expelled from Bagdad, and permitted him
and his successors nominally to occupy the throne.

Kalaun, el—Mansarr Kaléan (p. 59), succeeded to the exclu-
sion of a youthful son of Bibars, successfully opposed the
Mongols, and entered into treaties with the Emperor Ru-
dolph and other European princes.

El-Ashraf Khalil captures ‘Akka (Acre), the last place in
the Holy Land held by the Christians.

Ndsir, Mohammed en-Nésir ibn Kaldan (p. 33), succeeded
his brother Khalil at the age of nine years, but owing to
internal dissensions was compelled to retire to Syria.
With the aid ofthe Syrian emirs, however, he regained
his throne. Distrust, vindictiveness, and cupidity soon
showed themselves to beprominent characteristics of Nasir,
who treated his emirs with the utmost capriciousness,
loading them with rich gifts or ordering them to execu—
tion as the humour seized him. The emir Isma'il Abulﬁdé,
known also as a historian, succeeded, however, in retain-
ing his master’s favour till the time of his death. Towards
the mass of the population Nasir was liberal and conde-
scending, and towards the clergy indulgent. In order to
provide the enormous sums required for the expenses of
his court and his love of building, he appointed Christian
ofﬁcials in the custom-house and ﬁnance departments.

Hasan, Melilc en-Ndp-ir Abu’l-Ma'dliHasan ianaldan (p.49),
the sixth son ofNasir, was still a minor when he ascended
the throne. The lawless independence of the Mamelukes
and emirs was aggravated by a plague in 1348-49 which
exterminated whole families, whose property was imme-
diately seized by the government. After having been de—
throned in 1351, Hasan regained his sceptre three years
later, but in 1361 he was assassinated

CIRCASSIAN MAMELUKE SULTANS (Borgites). The founder of
this dynasty was ——

Bax-kill; (pp. 33, 60, 6.3), a Circassian slave, who succeeded
in raising himself to the throne by setting aside Haggi, a
boy of six years, and great-grandson of Mohammed en-
