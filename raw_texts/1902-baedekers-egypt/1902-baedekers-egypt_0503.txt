LUXOR. 24. Route. 233

Below Nakadeh the Nile makes a bend, beginning at ed—Denfilc
(W. bank). — Khizdm (E. bank; rail. station, p. 192) has a necro—
polis of the 11th Dynasty. — 32 M. (W. bank) Kamaleh.

0n the left bank, as we draw near Thebes, rise high limestone
hills, presenting precipitous sides to the river, from which,however,
they are separated by a strip of fertile land. The right bank is ﬂatter,
and the Arabian hills retreat farther into the distance. Before
reaching the point where the W. chain projects a long curved mass
of rock towards the river, we see to the left ﬁrst the great obelisk,
then the pylons of the temple of Karnak, half-concealed by palm-
trees. When we clear the abrupt proﬁle of the W. cliffs and new
formations are visible at its foot, we may catch a distant view of
Luxor towards the S.E. None of the buildings on the W. bank are
visible until the steamer has ascended as high as Karnak, then ﬁrst the
Colossi of Memnon and afterwards the Ramesseum and the Temple
of Dér el-bahri come into view. As we gradually approach Luxor,
we distinguish the ﬂags ﬂying above the consular dwellings. The
castellated villa of a Dutch resident is conspicuous in the back—
ground. In a few minutes more the steamer halts, close to the
colonnades of the temple. — 39 M. Luxor (see below).
