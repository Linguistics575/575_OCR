HISTORY.

The Shi’ite Fcitimites, who had gained possession of the
supreme power at Tunis, commanded by ‘Obédall'ah, at-
tacked Egypt, but were defeated.

Mohammed el-Ikhshid, a Turk and governor of Egypt, took
possession of the throne.

dear, a black slave, usurped the throne, and recognised
the suzerainty of the ‘Abbasides.

Géhar conquered Fostat for his master, the Fatimite Mu'izz,
great-grandson of ‘Obédallah. Mu'izz assumed the title of
khalif and founded the city of Masr el-thim (Cairo)
near Fostat (p. 32).

Fatimites. 969-1171.

The earlier of these governed the country admirably. The
population increased with wonderful rapidity, and the
whole of the commerce of India, as well as that of the in-

El-“Aziz, son ofMu‘izz, distinguished himself by his tolerance
and his love of science (p. 43).

King Baldwin of Jerusalem attacked Egypt unsuccessfully.

'Adid, the last Fatimite.

Contests for the ofﬁce of vizier took place during this reign
between Shawer and Dargham. The former, being exiled.

Saldheddin (Saladin) Shawer, quarrelling with the Kurds,
