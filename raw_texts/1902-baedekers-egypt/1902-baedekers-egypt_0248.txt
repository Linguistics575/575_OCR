0 Master’); ‘tdtib min Attdh
halclc lchmet (ésh’ (‘1 seek from
my Lord the price of a morsel
of bread’); ‘dna déf Allah wa’n—

and of the Prophet’). The usual
answer of the passer-by is,
‘Attdh yihannin 'aték’ (‘God will
have mercy on you’), or ‘Attdh
ya‘tik’ (‘God give thee’; comp.

' One of the most popular
characters to be met with in the
streets of Cairo is the SAkkA,
or WATER-CARRIER, with his goatskin of water, carried either by
himself or by a donkey, who still plies his trade, although the
water—works (p. 63) supply every house in the city7 as well as the
public sebils (p. olxiii), with water7 and though on many of the
houses there are brass tubes through which passers—by may take a
praught from the main pipes.
