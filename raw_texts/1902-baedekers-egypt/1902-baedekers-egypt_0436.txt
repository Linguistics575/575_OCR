i 86 UPPER EGYPT.

Mayﬂower, and Victoria of this line make similar three—weeks
voyages between Cairo and Assuan from December to May. The
general arrangements and conditions resemble those of Messrs.
Cook’s steamers. The return fare is 35L and upwards, according to
the cabin.

Voyages on the Nile are also arranged by the THEWFIKIEH NILE
NAVIGATION 00., programmes of which may be obtained at the of-
ﬁces mentioned on p. 26.

Passengers by steamer should beware of the risk of catching
cold by leaving the Windows of their cabin op'ln. They should also
avoid placing themselves too near the edge of the deck; and it is
well to remember (e.g. win-n shaving) that the steamers sometimes
run aground, CSpecially above Luxor. Liability to delay through
this last fact, makes it ilnpossible to be sure of reaching Cairo in
time to make connection with the ocean-steamers.
