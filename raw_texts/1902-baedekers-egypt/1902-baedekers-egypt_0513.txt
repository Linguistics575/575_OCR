of Linear. THEBES (,

were restored. Ramses II., the great-
est builder among the Pharaohs,
could not refrain from adding to ‘the
temple at Luxor. He added a large
colonnaded court in front of the
completed temple; he ‘usurped’
the ancient sanctuary of Thut-
mosis 111., and replaced the old re-
liefs with new ones, and he erected
a massive pylon, with obelisks and
colossal statues, the entrance of
which was formed next the sanc-
tuary of 'l‘hutmosis, so that the
longer axis of the main temple was
altered. The total length of the
temple was now 284 yds. Later cen-
turies brought few alterations to the
temple of Luxor. After theintroduc-
tion of Christianity it was converted
into a church. A modern wall on
the side next the river protects it
against damage from inundation.

In front of the principal Pylon
(Pl. P-P) of the temple were 6 Colos-
sal Statues of Ramses II., 2 sitting
and 4 standing, of which only the
two sitting and the westernmost of
the others are now in position. The
sitting ﬁgures are about 45 ft. in
height; that on the E. is buried
breast—high in rubbish. In front
of these seated ﬁgures rose two
Obelisks of pink granite, one of
which (the W.) now adorns the Place
de la Concorde at Paris. Its base,
adorned on one side with three pray-
ing apes, still remains in sit-u. The
inscriptions name Ramses the Pha-
raoh, with many pretentious titles,
as the founder of this gorgeous
building erected in honour of Am-
mon in S. Opet. The faces of these
obelisks, like those of most others,
are slightly convex, as the priestly
architects observed that a ﬂat sur-
face was apt to appear concave in a
strong light.
