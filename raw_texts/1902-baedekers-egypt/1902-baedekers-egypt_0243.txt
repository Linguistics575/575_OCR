4TH DAY. Foreaoon: '“Museum of Giseh (p. 78; closed on Mon. and Frid. ;
several visits advisable; note that the Nile Bridge is closed for two hours daily).
— Afternoon (on donkey-back): Ascent of the “‘Molcattam (view of Cairo by
sunset). Those who take the less common excursion to the Spring of Moses
and the smaller Petriﬁed Forest (p. 110), returning by the Molxattam, must
start early in winter.

5TH DAY. Forenoon: Mosques of' "El- Azhar (p. 43) and Hosea (p 42).
The mosque of El- Azhar should not be visited on 11. Friday, as there is
no teaching on that day, and the traveller would thus miss one of the
chief attractions. Spare time may be spent in the Bazaars (p. 42). —After-
110011 (by carriage 01 electric tramway): Island of Roda (p 69) and Old
Cairo (p.70), with the Coptic church of M11 Sezgeh (p 71) and the mosque

in the course of a forenoon, if necessary), a visit to Shabza (p. 76), which
may be added in the afternoon by those provided with a permit, is scarcely
worth while.

71‘}! DAY (by railway and on donkey- back, luncheon should be p1ovid-
ed). Memphis and' Sakkdia (p. 130). It is well worth while to ride via
Abusir (newly excavated sanctuary of the Sun p. 129) to the Mena House
Hotel and return thence to the town by electric tramway, but this must
be arranged beforehand with the donkey—boys at Bedrashén.

8'11! DAY: Barrage da Nil (p. 111), either by railway (from the Prin-
cipal Station-7 luncheon should be taken), or (preferable) by Cook ssteamer,
which plies twice a week (103 . luncheon not included in the fare).

The following places deserve repeated visits. — the Museum at Gz‘zeh;
the Citadel, or the Windmill Hills, for the sake of the view, the Tombs of
the Khalifs; the Bazaars (and street-trafﬁc), on a Thursday.

For the Mohammedan Festivals, see p. lxxi. On account of the crowd
ladies should not attend these except in a carriage. During the festivals
special permission is necessary for admission to many of the mosques.

Cairo, el— Kahira, or 1111157 el- Kahira, or simply Masr or Misr, is
situated in 30° 6’ N. latitude, and 31° 26’ E. longitude, on the
right bank of the Nile, about 12M. to the S. of the so- called ‘cow’s
belly’, the point where the stream divides into the Rosetta and Da-
mietta arms. It has not inaptly been styled ‘the diamond stud 011
the handle of the fan of the Delta’. On the E. side of the city, which
covers an area of about 11 square miles, rise the barren, reddish
cliffs of the Mokattam Hills (p. 108), about 650 ft. in height, which
form the commencement of the eastern desert. The city has ex-
tended so much towards the west of late years that it now reaches
the bank of the river and has entirely absorbed B11111; (p. 75), which
was formerly its harbour.

Cairo is the largest city in Africa, as well as in the Arabian
regions. It is the residence of the Khedive, and of the ministers
and principal authorities. At the census of 1897 the population was
returned as 565,187, or 570, 062 with the suburb of Helwan. The
number of resident Europeans was 35, 385, including 8670 Italians,
