93 M. Isma’iliya (p. 170); stcam—tramway to Port Sa'i‘d, sec
below.

The Suez train returns to Neﬂsheh, and then turns to the S.
(left). 0n the right we observe a large viceregal nursery for trees.
The train crosses the fresh—water canal, and remains on the W.
bank all the way to Suez. Farther on, to the left, we obtain a ﬁne
view of the bluish—green Bitter Lakes (p. 171). To the right rises
the Gebel Gene/feh, or Gebet Ahmed Daher, with its productive
quarrieS, which yielded material for the construction of the canal.
More in the background are the heights of the Gebel ‘Uwébid.
116 M. Fd‘yid. -— Ncar (128 M.) Geneﬂeh we lose sight of the
Bitter Lakes. On the left again stretches a vast sandy plain. 0n
the right, above the lower hills, tower the dark masses of the
‘Atc‘tlca Mts., the outlines of which stand out very prominently by
evening-light; they are also conspicuous from Suez. Before reach-
ing Shaluf (p. 171) we catch a glimpse of the Suez canal.

151 M. Suez. The station is in the Rue Colmar (Pl. 8; see p. 172).
The traveller on arrival is beset by a number of cicerpnes who
speak broken English, French, and other languages. The train
goes on to the (1531/2 M.) Docks Station.

14. The Suez Canal from Port Said to Suez.

The passage of the Suez Canal is interesting only on one of the large
steamers, for from the small steamboats which ply regularly between Is-
ma‘iliya and Port Sa‘id the passenger cannot see beyond the embankments
of the Canal. The S. part of the Canal, from Isma‘iliya to Suez, is the
more interesting. The passage from Port Sa‘id to Suez occupies 15-22 hrs.
The fare by the British steamers is abOut 3L, by the French steamers
100 fr., by the German steamers 41-60 marks; for the tax levied by the
Canal Co. on each traveller, see p. 167.

a. Isthmus of Suez and History of the Canal.

Thc Isthmus of Suez, a narrow neck of land which connects
Africa with Asia, is at its narrowest part 70 M. in width. 0n
the S. side it is washed by the N. part of the Gutf of Suez (Arab.
Baltr Kotzum, Greek Heroéipolite Bay), the western of the two
arms of the Red Sea which separate Africa and Asia. The idea of
a Suez Calla] is no modern conception. The earliest authenticated
