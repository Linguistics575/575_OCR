ARRIVAL AT PORT SA'iD. As in the case of the approach to Alex-
andria, the low sandy coast is still out of sight for some time after
the steamer meets the yellowish-green water opposite the Nile
mouths. The lighthouse (175 ft. high) and the masts of the ships
in port then come in sight and ﬁnally the huge breakwaters of the
harbour. The entrance, marked by buoys, is 1/2 M. wide, but the
actual channel between the moles is only 100—160 yds. in width.
The custom-house examination takes place on shore, luggage going
on to Isma‘iliya is not examined until that port is reached.
