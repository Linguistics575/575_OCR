112 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

....... After this there were two other battles fought be—
tween them, in both of which Typhon had the worst. ..... .

“Such, then, are the principal circumstances of this
famous story, the more harsh and shocking parts of it, such
as the cutting in pieces of Horus and the beheading of Isis,
being omitted.” (Plutarch, De [side ez‘ Osz'rz'a’e, xiivxx
Squire’s translation.)

The following is an extract from a hymn addressed
to Osiris by Isis and Nephthys (Brit. Mus. Papyrus
No. 10,188):—

“0 beloved of his father, lord of rejoicings, thou delightest
the hearts of the cycle of the gods, and thou illuminatest thy
house with thy beauties; the cycle of the gods fear thy
power, the earth trembleth through fear of thee.

I am thy wife who maketh thy protection, the sister who pro-
tecteth her brother, come, let me see thee, 0 lord of my love.

0 twice exalted one, mighty of attributes, come, let me
see thee; 0 baby who advancest, child, come, let me see thee.

Countries and regions weep for thee, the zones weep for
thee as if thou wert Sesheta, heaven and earth weep for
thee, inasmuch as thou art greater than the gods 3 may
there be no cessation of the glorifying of thy [£71.

Come to thy temple, be not afraid, thy son Horus em-
braces the circuit of heaven.

0 thou sovereign, who makest afraid, be not afraid. ’l‘hy
son Horus avenges thee and overthrows for thee the fiends
and the devils.

Hail, lord, follow after me with thy radiance, let me see
thee daily; the smell of thy flesh is like that of Punt (126.,
the spice land of Arabia).

Thou art adored by the venerable women, in peace; the
entire cycle of the gods rejoice.

Come thou to thy wife in peace, her heart ﬂutters
through her love for thee, she will embrace thee and not let
thee depart from her; her heart is oppressed because of her
anxiety to see thee and thy beauties. She has made an end
