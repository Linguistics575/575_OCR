144 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

The Mosque 0f SULTAN HASAN, built of stone
taken from the pyramids of Gizeh, is close to the citadel, and
is generally considered to be the grandest in Cairo. It was
built by Hasan, one of the younger sons of Sultan Nasir, and
its construction occupied three years, A.D. 1356—1358. It
is said that when the building was ﬁnished the architect’s
hands were cut off to prevent his executing a similar work
again. This story, though probably false, shows that the
mosque was considered of great beauty, and the judgment
of competent critics of to—day endorses the opinion of it
which was prevalent in Hasan’s time. Hasan’s tomb is
situated on the east side of the building. The remaining
minaret* is about 280 feet high, the greatest length of the
mosque is about 320 feet, and the width about 200 feet. In
the open court are two fountains which were formerly used,
one by the Egyptians, and one by the Turks. On the
eastern side are still to be seen a few of the balls which
were ﬁred at the mosque by the army of Napoleon.

The Mosque of Barkﬁk (A.D. 1382-1399) contains the
tomb of the daughter of Barkﬁk.

The Mosque of MUAIYAD, one of the Circassian
Mamelukes, was founded between the years 1412—1420; it is
also known as the “Red Mosque,” from the colour of the
walls outside. “Externally it measures about 300 feet by
250, and possesses an internal court, surrounded by double
colonnades on three sides, and a triple range of arches on
the side looking towards Mecca, where also are situated—as
in that of Barkﬁk—the tombs of the founder and his family.
A considerable number of ancient columns have been used in
the erection of the building, but the superstructure is so light
and elegant, that the effect is agreeable.” 1' The bronze gate
in front belonged originally to the mosque of Sultan Hasan.
