been suggested by its founder. The mosque is called the
“ Fortress of the Goat,” because it is said to mark the spot
where Abraham offered up the ram; others say that the
ark rested here.

The Mosque 0f HAKIM (A.D. 996—1020), the third
Fatimite Khalif, was built on the plan of the mosque of ibn
Tulﬁn (see above); the date over one of the gates is A.H. 393
=A.D. 1003. The Museum of Arab art is located here.

The Mosque EL-AZHAR is said to have been founded
by Johar, the general of Mu'izz, about A.D. 980. The plan
of the principal part was the same as that of the mosque of
'Amr, but very little of the original building remains. It
was made a university by the Khalif ‘Aziz (A.D. 975—996),
and great alterations were made in the building by different
Sultans in the twelfth, thirteenth, ﬁfteenth, sixteenth, and
eighteenth centuries; Sa‘id Pasha made the last, A.D. 1848.
The minarets belong to different periods; the mosque has six
gates, and at the principal of these, the “ Gate ofthe Barbers,”
is the entrance. On three of the sides of the open court are
compartments, each of which is reserved for the worshippers
who belong to a certain country. The Liwan of the mosque
is huge, and its ceiling is supported upon 38o pillars of
various kinds of stone; it is here that the greater part of
the students of the university carry on their studies. The
number of students varies from 10,000 to 13,000, and the
education, from the Muhammadan point of View, is perhaps
the most thorough in the whole world.

In the Citadel are :7—1. The Mosque of Yﬁsuf Salaheddin,
built A.D. 1171—1198; 2. The Mosque of Suleman Pasha
or Sultan Selim, built A.H. 391 = A.D 1001.

The Muristan Kalaﬁn, originally a hospital, contains the
tomb of El-Mansﬁr Kalaﬁn (A.D. 1279—1290), which is
decorated with marble mosaics.

The Mosque-tomb of Muhammad en-Nasir (A.D, 1293—
1341), son of Kalaﬁn, stands near that of Iﬁalaﬁn.
