and certain parts of the roof were entirely covered over with

HAGAR SILSILEH.

Hagar (or Gebel) Silsileh, 541% miles from Cairo, on
the east and west banks of the river, derives its name
probably not from the Arabic word of like sound meaning
“chain,” but from the Coptic xwkxex, meaning “stone
wall ”; the place is usually called ngv‘ﬁ C/zemm in
hieroglyphic texts. The ancient Egyptians here quarried
the greater part of the sandstone used by them in their
buildings, and the names of the kings inscribed in the caves
here show that these quarries were used from the earliest to
the latest periods. The most extensive of these are to be
found on the east bank of the river, but those on the west
bank contain the interesting tablets of Heru—em-heb, a king
of the XVIIIth dynasty, who is represented conquering the
Ethiopians, Seti 1., Rameses II. his son, Meneptah, etc.
At Silsileh the Nile was worshipped, and the little temple
which Rameses II. built in this place seems to have been
dedicated chieﬂy to it. At this point the Nile narrows very
much, and it is generally thought that a cataract once
existed here ; there is, however, no evidence to show when
the Nile broke through and swept such a barrier, if it ever
existed, away.
