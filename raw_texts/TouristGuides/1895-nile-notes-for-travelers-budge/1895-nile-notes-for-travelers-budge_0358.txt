lived during the Vlth and XIIth dynasties. The second group
is composed of tombs of different periods; they are hewn out
of a lower layer of stone, and are not of so much importance.
The third group, made during the Roman occupation of

the governor of the district of the cataract, and the general
who commanded a lightly-armed body of soldiers called “run-
