WHXTE AND RED MONASTERIES. 265

The Der el-Abyad or “White Monastery,” so-called
because of the colour of the stone of which it is built, but
better known by the name of Amba Shenﬁdah, is situated
on the west bank of the river near Sﬁhak, 317% miles from
Cairo. “The peculiarity of this monastery is that the in-
terior was once a magniﬁcent basilica, while the exterior
was built by the Empress Helena, in the ancient Egyptian
style. The walls slope inwards towards the summit, where

Libyan desert, Where the sand encroaches on the plain. . .

when a certain heathen princess came riding on a mule
to desecrate the church, the earth opened and swallowed
her up. The walls enclose a space measuring about 240
feet by 133 feet. The convent was dedicated to Shenﬁti,
a celebrated Coptic saint who lived in the fourth century
of our era.* Curzon says (of. 517., p. 132) ...... “The
tall granite columns of the ancient church reared themselves
like an avenue on either side of the desecrated nave, which
is now open to the sky, and is used as a promenade for a
host of chickens ..... . . . . The principal entrance was
formerly at the west end, where there is a small vestibule,
immediately within the door of which, on the left hand, is
