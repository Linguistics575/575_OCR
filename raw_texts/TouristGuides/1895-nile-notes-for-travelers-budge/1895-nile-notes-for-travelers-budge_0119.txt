96 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

MUT o , the ‘ Mother,’was one of the divinities of

the Theban triad; she was supposed to represent Nature,
the mother of all things.

CHEPERA , the ‘Creator,’ was associated with

Ptah, and was supposed to be the god who caused himself
to come into existence. He is represented with a beetle
for his head. In later days he was supposed to be the father
of the gods and creator of the universe, and the attributes
which had been applied to R5 during the Middle Empire
were transferred to him. (See pp. zoo—202.)

BAST $51 was principally worshipped in Lower Egypt

at Bubastis, where a magniﬁcent temple was built in her
honour (see p. 130); she is represented with the head of a
cat, and was associated with Ptah. The correct reading of
her name appears to be Sechet, and she represents the ﬂame
of the S 'n.
