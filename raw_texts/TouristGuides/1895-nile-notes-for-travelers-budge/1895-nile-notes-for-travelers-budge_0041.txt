inscribed in hieroglyphics, Greek and demotic with a decree made at
Canopus by the priesthood, assembled there from all parts of Egypt,
in honour of Ptolemy III. It mentions the great beneﬁts which he
had conferred upon Egypt, and states what fesrivals are to be celebrated
in his honour and in that of Bereniee, etc., and concludes with a
resolution ordering that a copy of this inscription in hieroglyphics,
Greek and demotic shall be placed in every large temple of Egypt.
Two other copies ofthis work are known.
