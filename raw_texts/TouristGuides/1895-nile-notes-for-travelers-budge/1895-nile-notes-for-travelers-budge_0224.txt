possessors in rolling the balls of excrementitious matter in
which they enclose their eggs. These balls are at ﬁrst irregu-
larly shaped and soft, but by degrees, and during the process
of rolling along, become rounded and harder; they are
propelled by means of the hind legs. Sometimes these
balls are an inch and a half or two inches in diameter, and
in rolling them along the beetles stand almost upon their
heads, with the heads turned from the balls. They do this
in order to bury their balls in holes which they have already

the larvae when hatched feed. Horapollo thought that the
beetle was self-produced, but he made this mistake on
account of the females being exceedingly like the males,
and because both sexes appear to divide the care of the
preservation of their offspring equally between them.

Museum (No. 10, 188), the god Khepera is identiﬁed with
the god Neb-er-tcher, who, in describing the creation of gods,
men, animals and things says :—“I am he who evolved
himself under the form of the god Khepera. I, the evolver
of evolutions, evolved myself, the evolver of all evolutions,
