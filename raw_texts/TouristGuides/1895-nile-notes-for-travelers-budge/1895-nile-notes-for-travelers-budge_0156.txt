indicate that the place was situated in a swampy district,

and that foreigners dwelt there. The Arabs have adopted
the shorter name of the town, and call it San. Dr. H.
Brugsch endeavoured to show that Tanis represented the
town of Rameses, which was built by the Israelites, but
his theory has not been generally accepted, although there
is no doubt whatever that Tchar and Tanis are one and the
same town. The other names of Tanis given by Dr.
Brugsch in his great Dz'clz'mmaz're Géogmp/zz'que are “Mesen,
Mesen of the North, Teb of the North, and Behutet of the
North.” Tanis was situated on the right or east bank of the
Tana'itic branch of the Nile, about thirty miles nearly due
west of the ancient Pelusium; and as it was near the north-
east frontier of Egypt, it was always one of the towns which
formed the object of the ﬁrst attack of the so-called
Hyksos, Syrians, Assyrians, Greeks, Arabs, and Turks.
The excavations which have been made in the ruins round
about San by Mariette and Petrie prove that Tanis must
have been one of the largest and most important cities in
the Delta. The earliest monuments found here date from
the time of Pepi 1., VIth dynasty, about RC. 3233; the
next oldest are the black granite statues of Usertsen I. and

* Zoan must have been considered a place of great importance by
the Hebrews, for they date the founding of Hebron by it (Numbers,
xiii. 22), and Isaiah, describing the future calamities of Egypt, says,
“ Surely the princes of Zoan are fools.” (Isaiah xix. II.)
