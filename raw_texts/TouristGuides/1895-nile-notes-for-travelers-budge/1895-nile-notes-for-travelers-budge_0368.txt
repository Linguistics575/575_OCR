sued for peace. In the reign of Diocletian the greater part
of the country south of l’hilae was ceded to the Nubians or
Ethiopians. The principal tribes of the Ethiopians in
ancient days were I. Blemmyes and Megabari, 2. Ichthyo-

After leaving Philge, the first place of interest passed is
Dabod, on the west bank of the river, 599% miles from
Cairo. At this place, called ok [3 g Ta-het in the
inscriptions, are the ruins of a temple founded by At’a—char-
Amenﬁ“ a king of Ethiopia, who reigned about the middle
of the third century B.C. The names of Ptolemy VII.
Philometor and Ptolemy IX. Physcon are found engraved
upon parts of the building. Dabéd probably stands on the
site of the ancient Parembole, a port or castle on the borders
of Egypt and Ethiopia, and attached alternately to each
kingdom. During the reign of Diocletian it was ceded to the
Nubze by the Romans, and it was frequently attacked by the
Blemmyes from the east bank of the river. At Kardésh,
on the west bank of the river, 615 miles from Cairo, are the
ruins of a temple and a quarry; seven miles further south,
on the west bank of the river, is Wéldi Téfah, where
there are also some ruins; they are, however, of little
interest. -
