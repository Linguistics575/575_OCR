Mat; the king kneels before him in adoration, and the god
says that he will give him myriads of years and festivals;

Korosko, on the east bank of the river, 703 miles from
Cairo, was from the earliest times the point of departure

carrying away the wives and cattle, and by cutting down the
men on their way to and from the wells. This temple was
repaired by 'l‘hothmes III. and other kings of the XVIlIth
dynasty.
