THE RELIGION AND GODS OF EGYPT. 95

PTAH D i ,the ‘Opener,’ perhaps the oldest of all the
gods of Eogypt, was honoured with a temple and worshipped
at Memphis from the time of the 151: dynasty.
He is said to be the father of the gods, who
came forth from his eye, and of men, who
came forth from his mouth. He is repre-
sented in the form of a mummy, and he

holds a sceptre composed of 1 av, ‘strength,’

(272M, ‘life,’ and M, ‘stability.’ With
reference to his connection with the resur=
rection and the nether-world, he is called
PTAHSEKER-AUSAR, and is then repre-
sented as a little squat boy, at times wearing
a beetle on his head. He is at times repre- —— pun.
sented with Isis and Nephthys, and then appears to be a
form of Osiris.
