VII. Dér el-Bahari. This temple was built by Hatshep—
set, the sister and wife of Thothmes 11., B.C. 1600. The
ﬁnest marble limestone was used in its construction, and its
architect seems to have been an able man called Senmut,
who was honoured with the friendship of the queen, and

temple was an avenue of sandstone sphinxes and two
obelisks. It was built in stages on the side of a hill, and
its courts were connected by means of ﬂights of steps.

been used for sepulchres. The wall sculptures are beautiful
specimens of art, and depict the return of Egyptian soldiers
from some military expedition, and the scenes which took
place during the expedition which the queen organized and
sent off to Punt. This latter expedition was most successful,
and returned to Egypt laden with things the “like of which
had never before been seen in that land.” The prince of
Punt came to Egypt with a large following, and became a
