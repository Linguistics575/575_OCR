94 NOTES FOR TRAVELLERS IN EGYPT.

The following is a list of the most important gods with
their names in hieroglyphs; it will be readily seen how
very many of them are merely forms of the sun-god Ra,
and how many of them have the same attributes :-

CHNEMU,* the ‘Moulder,’ ﬁzﬁ, is represented

with the head of a ram, and is one of the oldest gods of

the Egyptian religion. He was thought
to possess some of the attributes of
Amen, Ra, and Ptah, and shared with
the last-named god the attribute of
“maker of mankind.“ At Philae he is
represented making man out of clay on
a potter’s wheel. Chnemu put together
the scattered limbs of the dead body of
Osiris, and it was he who constructed
the beautiful woman who became the
wife of Bata in the Tale of the Two
Brothers. Like Amen-Ra he is said to
be the father of the gods. His cult
had great vogue in the regions round
about the ﬁrst cataract, where he was
always associated with Aneq and Sati.
In bus-reliefs he is usually coloured
green, and wears the atef cr0wnT with
uraei, etc.

 

CHNEMU.
