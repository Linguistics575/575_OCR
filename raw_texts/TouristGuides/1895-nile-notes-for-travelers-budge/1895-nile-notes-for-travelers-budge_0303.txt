tecture than to Coptic. The principal church shows two
other features which do not occur elsewhere in the Christian
buildings of Egypt, namely, an external atrium surrounded

Possibly the same remark may apply to the structure of the
iconostasis, which has two side-doors and no central
entrance, though this arrangement is not quite unparalleled
in the churches of Upper Egypt, and may be a later altera-
tion. It will be noticed that the church has a triple
western entrance from the Cloisters.” (Butler, Amie”! Coptic
