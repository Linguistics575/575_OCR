French in 1798—1801 it was said to be 2,500,000; Sir
Gardner Wilkinson, however, set it down at as low a ﬁgure
as 1,500,000. In 1821 the population numbered 2,514,000,
and in 1846 it had risen to 4,456,186. The last census was
ordered by Khedivial decree on December 2, 1881, and it
was completed on May 3, 1882. According to the ofﬁcial
statement published in the R668713€7ll€72f Gézzéml dc [’Egyple,
at Cairo, in 1884, it amounted in 1882 to 6,806,381 persons,
of whom 3,216,847 were men, and 3,252,869 were women.
Of the 6,806,381 persons, 6,708,185 were inhabitants of the
country, and 98,196 were nomads. It showed that there
were in the total 245,779 Bedawin and 90,886 foreigners;
the number was made up in the following manner :—

Cairo, 374,838; Alexandria, 231,396; Damietta, 43,616;
Rosetta, 19,378; Port Sa‘id, 21,296, and Suez, 11,175. Of
the provinces Behéreh contained 398,856 ; Sherkiyeh,
464,655; Dalthaliyeh, 586,033; Gharbiyeh, 929,488; Kal-
