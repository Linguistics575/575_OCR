 

Expansion by Irrigation

With these conﬂicting claims to reconcile, the
engineers were compelled to weigh the pros and
cons of their project in every aspect before again
testing public opinion. That they succeeded in
their task is shown by the general approval of
their modiﬁed scheme, by which the dam is to be
but two thirds as high as at ﬁrst proposed. A head
of forty-six feet of water satisﬁes the engineers,
and does not alarm the archaeologists; for, although
submerging portions of the island, it leaves the
temple, pylons, and prized sculptures fairly above
water-level.

When the builders have ﬁnished their labors, vis-
itors to Upper Egypt can never realize the present
beauty of Philee. The Isis temple, the chapel of
Hathor, the Diocletian portal, one of the legendary
graves of Osiris, the well-preserved pavilion called
“Pharaoh’s Bed,”——the designer of which was no
stranger to Greek art, and within whose walls thou-
sands of tourists have partaken of their midday
luncheon,—will all be there, like jewels wrenched
from glorious settings. The structures will rise
from a placid lake, deprived of the graceful eleva-
tion and artistic symmetry that add much to their
fame.

Confessedly Philie will be impaired artistically,
for it is safe to assume that the zealous engineers
understate the extent of the submergence. A
scientiﬁc English observer, who studied the subject
at close quarters,—f1'om the island itself,—says:
“The four great pylons will, of course, stand up

out of the new lake, but its waters will rise to their
