Paradoxical Administration

masses and the upper class is wide, the desire for
petty ofﬁce-holding is one of the crying evils of
Egypt. It is estimated that two per cent. of the
able-bodied men serve the government in some

in Egypt than in Great Britain, with ﬁve times the
population. Many abuses have been abolished, but
