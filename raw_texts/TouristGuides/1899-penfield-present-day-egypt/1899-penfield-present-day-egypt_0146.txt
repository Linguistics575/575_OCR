Since the year 1886 the ﬁnances of Egypt have
improved to an extent emphasizing the nation’s
emergence from practical bankruptcy to an envi-
able condition of credit to be found in the history
of but few countries. So marked was the improve-
ment that in 1890 the government was in a posi-
tion to carry into eﬂect a conversion of the whole
of its external debt, thereby scaling the rate of in-
terest in some instances nearly half. Although
Egypt’s burden of interest has thus been greatly de-
creased, yet the country has still to ﬁnd nearly nine-
teen million dollars for the yearly interest charges.
The presentbonded debt, approximately stated, with
the current premium quoted on European bourses
on the several classes of obligations, is as follows:

Guaranteed loan, 3 % (quoted 5 premium) $ 42,442,000
Privileged debt, 3% (quoted 2} premium) 142,854,000
Uniﬁed debt, 4 0/, (quoted 7 premium) 272,037,000
Domains loan, 9% (quoted 5 premium) 19,418,000

Daira Sanieh loan, 4 % (quoted 1:} premium) 32,191,000
Total bonded debt, $508,942,000

almost every foot of the soil utilized, it would not be possible for
923 persons to the square mile to be supported. And, further, it
should be borne in mind that the oﬂicial census ﬁn‘ng Egypt’s popu-
lation at 9,750,000 included many Bedouin tribes and other desert-
dwellers, and was further swollen by the inclusion of many Nubiaus
who had left their southern provinces and crossed the frontier into
Egypt.
