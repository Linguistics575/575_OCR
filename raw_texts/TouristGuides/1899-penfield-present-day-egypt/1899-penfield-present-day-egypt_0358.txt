House and Helouan the rainfall is generally less
than in the capital, while at Luxor and Assuan a
shower is regarded by the natives as a wonder of
nature. Alexandria and other places on the Medi-

the rest of the country from storms. Cairo’s mean

at Orotava, 61° at Madeira, and 49° at Nice and

On the coldest days in Cairo the thermometer
never falls below 34°, and this degree of frigidity
occurs only at long intervals. Some Cairenes re-
call a slight snowfall a half—century ago, and a thin
ﬁlm of ice on pools in the suburbs may be seen sev—

by the desert inﬂuence on the early morning air,
and is of short duration after sunrise. The cool
nights of winter give the air much of its stimulat-
ing property; and in summer, however hot the
days, the nights are nearly always made comfor-

The Egyptian year has but two seasons, summer

ary. It is only in July, August, and September that
the heat is intense; the rest of the year is climati-
cally agreeable. When the Nile is high, in the
autumn, there is at times suﬂicient humidity to
cause some discomfort, especially when the humid-
