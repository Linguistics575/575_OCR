Present-Day Egypt

Cairo or Alexandria, holding the reins over a dash-
ing pair, and accompanied by an aide-de—camp or
one of his many relatives.

Before the heat of summer comes, the khedival
establishment, with its army of officials and atten-
dants, moves to Alexandria. Six railway-trains are
required to transfer the court. The khedive and
his ministers and other high ofﬁcers go in state in
an observation saloon-car of American make.

The historic structure, Ras-el-Teen, overlooking
Alexandria harbor, is treated by the khedive simply
as an ofﬁcial palace, as Abdin is in Cairo. The
home-loving instinct has caused the khedive to
create a summer retreat at Montazah, snugly nestled
on the picturesque Mediterranean coast, a few miles
to the east of Alexandria. There the family life,
with artistic and musical surroundings, is carried
on in charming simplicity. Perplcxities arising
from conferences at Ras-el—Teen are left in the
precincts of the old palace.

A mile to the eastward of Montazah is Abukir
Bay, made famous by Nelson’s victory over the
French ﬂeet little more than a century ago. Al-
though Montazah was reclaimed from the desert
only six years since, forests of quick-growing trees
have sprung into existence; many varieties of game-
birds and animals have been domiciled there, in-
cluding native antelope and European red deer, for
the khedive is an ardent sportsman. In a remote
part of the estate is the camp of the khedive’s
camel-corps, whose Bedouin riders are trained
marksmen, and with whom he makes long journeys
