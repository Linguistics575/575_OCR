are merely openings in the wall devoid of glass or

smoke of the ﬁres of dung or corn-cobs ﬁlls the houses
and hangs heavy in the lanes. Yet, in spite of this
apparently deliberate effort to exclude air, the people
seem well—conditioned .and healthy, their occupation

an upper story, in which some relief at least is possible
from the heavy air below, and Where the passing breeze
