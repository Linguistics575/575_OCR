Egypt

Philae is really very beautiful, and, no matter under
What effect of light or from what point of view it may
be seen, it is always a picture; and, jewel-like, the beauty
of the island is enhanced by the setting of rugged hills
and ﬂowing stream which encircle it.

I recently paid a last farewell visit to Philm, and
already the work necessary for its preservation had
converted the temple into a workshop, and, by the cut-
ting down of its trees, and the covering of the natural
banks with masonry, much of its original charm has
been destroyed. Whether the great dam Will result in
its eventual destruction or not, its banks at any rate
will be submerged, and it can never again be seen as the
beautiful verdure—clad island we have known.

The temple itself has never been completed, the
advent of the Romans and the amour: of Cleopatra no
doubt being among the contributing causes. This
perhaps adds a little to the interest of the building, as
it gives us an insight into the methods adopted in its
construction. In the colonnade which leads to the
great pylon, the columns are remarkable for the great
variety of their capitals, and in some cases they are still
uncarved, only the ﬁrst “blocking out ” of the stone
having been done. From this, as well from other
unﬁnished decorations elsewhere, it is fair to assume
that the Egyptians were in the habit of ﬁrst building,
and then elaborating their carvings in situ, where the
full effect of the design might be estimated from time
to time ; a better principle, to my mind, than our own,

which usually completes such decoration on the mason’s
