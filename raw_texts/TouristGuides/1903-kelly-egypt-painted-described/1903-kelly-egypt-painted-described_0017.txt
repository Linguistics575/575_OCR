Egypt
heartily rendered to the proprietors of Black and W/zz'te
and The Centmy Magazine for their kind permission to
repeat matter already published by them, and also to
the many owners of my work, who have so generously
allowed the reproduction of pictures in their possession
——a courteous and kindly co—operation without which
it would have been almost impossible to complete this

volume.
