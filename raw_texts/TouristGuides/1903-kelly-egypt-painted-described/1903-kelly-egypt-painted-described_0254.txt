Returning to Luxor, you may ride along the banks
of a small “khalig” or canal, full during high Nile
but usually dry after December. This is well shaded
by sycamore and tamarisk trees, and produces a great

always most attentive to strangers. Some years ago
he entertained my Wife and myself to dinner. Twelve
