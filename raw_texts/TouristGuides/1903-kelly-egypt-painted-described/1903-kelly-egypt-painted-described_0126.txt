Mosques and Public Buildings
and would add those of El Ghury and Sultan Barkﬁk

as very important examples, while among those of later
date the little Mosque of Abu—Bekr, recently beautifully
and carefully restored, has many points of interest,
especially in its tile dados and open metal-work.

Viewed from the streets, the mosques are usually of
simple but digniﬁed design. The facade is generally of
plain masonry, broken only by the several tiers of small
windows, either square, round—headed, or occasionally
circular, and ﬁlled in with wrought-iron work of a more
or less ornate character. Frequently these windows are
placed in shallow recesses, ﬁnishing in a cornice of
carved stone, the shadows frOm which, as well as from
the projecting wall, serving to break up an otherwise
ﬂat space into perpendicular lines.

The sky-line is usually battlemented or ﬁnished by a
projecting cornice, as in the Hassan Mosque. Above
this rises the square base of the dome, gradually
returned by “squinches” to the circular form of the
dome itself, and above all rise one or more minarets
of two or three diminishing stages, terminating in a
bold yet delicately proportioned cupola or ﬁnial.
Exterior ornament is usually conﬁned to the minarets,
the dome, and especially to the doorways, which are
trefoil-headed and richly embellished with pendentive
carvings, a ﬁtting framework to the handsome metal—
work which is so common a feature of the door itself.

You will notice in nearly all cases that the lintel
of the door is formed of stone, apparently coloured
in black and white designs of a curious pattern. In
