The soil is wonderfully fertile, and the extent of its
productiveness depends largely upon the regular and
suﬂicient distribution of irrigating water, in which work
much of the labour of the ﬁeld is employed. The
annual overﬂow of the Nile reaches a very small pro-
portion of the whole land, which is therefore fed by a
system of large canals which carry the fertilising ﬂuid
to every corner of the Delta. From these larger canals
(which also form useful highways) branch lesser ones,
intersecting the country in all directions, and from
which each estate or farm draws its supply. This supply
is regulated by Government, the canals being ﬁlled in
rotation, and the farmer allowed so many shadoofs
or sakkias according to his acreage; and, in the case
of the steam-pump, the water raised is authorised up
to a certain number of gallons per day or per week,
and is measured by meter.

The ﬁelds are nearly always divided into little
squares formed by a low ridge of mud ; and the water
being brought from the pumps by a shallow channel
formed in the same way, all that is required is to break
down the wall with a “fass” (or hoe), or even with
the foot, and so allow the water to ﬂood whichever
portion of the ﬁeld requires it. When suﬂicient has
been given to one square, the channel is closed by a
clod of earth and the water diverted into another part
of the ﬁeld.

Conditions in Egypt are favourable to crop-raising,
and, given an adequate water-supply, success depends
almost entirely upon the efforts of the farmer; and
