Introductory

The vegetable life of these canals is pretty, and you
recognise many familiar plants, while others are strange.
Kingﬁshers and wagtails are numerous, and among the
irrigated ﬁelds the “ paddy bird " gleams White against

Bedawin, too proud to mingle with the noisy “ fellah,"
though probably sympathising with their witticisms at
the expense of the unbeliever. Little girls crying
“ moyeh ” 3 perambulate the platform ministering to the
needs of the thirsty; and among the native travellers
