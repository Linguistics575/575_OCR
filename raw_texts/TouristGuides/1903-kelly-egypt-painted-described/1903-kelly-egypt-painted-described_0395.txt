ness, and it is said that once these animals are put to
sakkia work they never again see the sun. Here is a
pretty “ esbeh ” shaded by mulberriesand perhaps sur-
rounded by a vine-walk. In the ﬁelds Isaac drives his
yoke of oxen, while Rebecca leads her ﬂock to water,
or again, Rachel, “balass” on head, walks majestically
and gracefully in quest of her domestic water-supply.
It is all very Scriptural, and the very life and conversa-
tion of the people repeat those of the Old Testament.

Away from the canal itself, the water is carried in
little channels to all parts of the ﬁeld, and these narrow
banks again form the only deﬁned pathway through the
cultivated lands.

As you ride along the people press upon you offers
of hospitality in some form, and importune the traveller
to “ honour the house by breaking bread in it." One
such invitation I remember very well. The farmhouse
in question stood on the opposite side of the canal,
and its owner, Who was resting beneath the shade of
the fig-tree which overshadowed it, rose and begged
us to rest and have some refreshment. We declined
the polite offer, but he, exclaiming that we should
never pass lzi: “esbeh” without eating, mounted his
horse and chased us until we were forced to return
and do him this honour. This man, Shelil~en—Nebraishi
by name, had been exiled from Egypt and took service
with the Mahdi ; he commanded a regiment of cavalry
during the early stages of the Mahdist rising, but
deserted and returned to Egypt on the appearance of
the English, with Whom he said he had no quarrel.
