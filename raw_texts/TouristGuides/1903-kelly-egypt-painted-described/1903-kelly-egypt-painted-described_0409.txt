Of late the Government have been making strenuous
efforts to have all these pools ﬁlled and the cemeteries
removed to better sites at a distance ; and the last time
that I visited Kahbﬁna I found that this order had
been carried out, and the pool no longer remained to
add beauty to the landscape by its reﬂection of town
and date—grove.

While always ﬁnding the male inhabitants curiously

were excessively shy, and as I passed them in the street
they would turn their faces to the wall and gather their
children to them, lest the “evil eye” of the Christian
should bring disaster upon them. I found, however,
that after a time this restraint broke down, and in
the end I was able to get models for my pictures fro

The men I found to be usually well set-up and
handsome; the women, occasionally beautiful Whe
young, on approaching middle age become plain t
a degree, and one almost regrets that, no doubt owin
(to the exigencies of their ﬁeld-work, the use of the vei
