Egypt

traﬂic has almost disappeared, except during high Nile,
when for a brief period the long-suffering watermen can
ply their trade proﬁtably. In some places villages, built
originally close upon the river—bank, are now so far from
the remnant of the stream trickling on the other side,
that their women must traverse nearly a mile of sand
and mud before they can ﬁll their jars. Not only is
the supply limited, but it is correspondingly bad in
quality. The shallow stream cannot remain fresh under
the hot sun, while débris of all kinds decomposing in it
pollute still further an already tainted supply. With a
further hundred miles or so of steadily diminishing
volume and constantly added contamination, it may
readily be imagined that the inhabitants of the coast
towns have to undergo real privation in the matter of
their drinking-supply, and one can only wonder that
disease is not more common among them. No doubt
centuries of gradual inoculation protect the native from
the effects of water impurities which few Europeans
could withstand. Still, natural immunity notwithstand—

strongest protest against the manner in which the lower
river is neglected by the authorities in Cairo; for,
