   

Egypt
is a continuous delight, in which form and colour
changing atmospheric effect Ô¨Åll every hour of
with picture subjects hardly possible of attainment

What could be more restful than the camp
be enjoyed beside these quiet waterways, Where n
is found to mar the poetic beauty of surroundings .
the quiet water alternately repeats or foils !
