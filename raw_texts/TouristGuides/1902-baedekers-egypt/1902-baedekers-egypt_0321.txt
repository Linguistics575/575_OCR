and coated with a yellow varnish. In most instances the arms were crossed

ROOM LXXXIV. ROYAL MUMMIES AND OBJECTS FOUND WITH THEM.

Towards the close of the New Empire the power of the Egyptian state
gradually declined, until ﬁnally not even the last resting-places Of the
dead could be secured from robbers. Not only the necropolis at Drah
Abu"l-Negga (p. 262). but even the secluded tombs in the ‘Valley of Kings”
(1). 262) were plundered. The authorities recognized their impotence and
contented themselves with rescuing the mummies of the ancient Pharaohs.
The mummy of Ramses 11. was therefore transferred from its tomb at
Biban el-Mulﬁk (p. 267) to that of Sethos 1., and when that refuge ceased
to be deemed secure, both bodies were removed to the tomb Of Amenophis 1.
Finally, under the 21st Dyn., it was resolved to protect the royal mummies
from farther profanation by interring them all together in a rocky cleft
near Der el-bahri (p. 283), which was artiﬁcially widened for the purpose.
The corpses of the ruling dynasty were also placed here. Thus at last
the remains of the great monarchs of the New Empire — Amosis 1.,
Thutmosis 111., Sethos 1., and Ramses 11. —— were left in peace until in
1875 the fellahin once more discovered their secret resting-place and the
plundering of the mummies began again. The modern thieves succeeded
in keeping their secret to themselves for a considerable period, but in
1881 they were traced, and the mummies were deposited in the museum
at Cairo to save them from the hands of the robbers.

By the staircase in the large cruciform room are two huge cofﬁns
in the form of Osiris : 1172. Cofﬁn of Queen Ahhotep (comp.

(end of the 17th Dyn.); 1176. Cofﬁn of Siamon, a child of ﬁve or
six years, eldest son of Amosis 1.; 1183. Cofﬁn of King Pinotem 1.,
whose mummy was found in the large cofﬁn of Queen Ah-hotep
