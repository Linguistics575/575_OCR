190 Route 17 nanxwr Ei.—'Anlsn. From Cairo

rhus, a species of Morniyrus (Arab. Mizdeh), was held in such high honour
here. that the inhabitants refused to eat any ﬁsh caught by a hook, lest
the hook might previously have injured an Oxyrynchus. In the neigh-
bouring town of Cynopolis (p. 190) the dog was held in equal honour,
and Plutart-h relates how a ‘very pretty quarrel‘, the settlement of which
required the intervention of the Romans, arose between the two towns,
owing to the facts that the citizens of each had killed and dined on the
sacred animals of the other. On the introduction of Christianity Oxy-
rynchos became a veritable town of monks. In the town itself were 12
churches and all ronnd it convent jostled convent. In the 5th cent. the
diocese of Oxyrynchos is said to have contained 10,000 monks and 12,000
nuns. In the Mameluke period it was still of some importance, but it has
since steadily declined. Extensive excavations nndertaken here in 1897 by
Grenfell yielded large quantities of Greek, Coptic. and Arabic papyri. -—
