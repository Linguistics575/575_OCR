NOTE. The present-future tense is limited exclusively to the present by
preﬁxing be to the verb (also me to the 1st pers. plur., b alone to the lst
pers. sing); e.g. betz'ksar, thou (masc.) art breaking (now), baksm-, I am
breaking (now), bem‘ksm- or meat/ism, we are breaking (now). Sometimes
“ammo, ‘amm, and am are placed before the verb with the same effect. —
The particle will placed before all forms of the presents-future places the‘
action in the immediate future. Before the fem. sing. Willa also is used
and before the plur. mam,- e.g. rdlz yiksarhu, he is on the point of break-
ing its, will tiksaruh or Willa tiksm'uh, she is on the point of breaking it.

‘" All the varieties of the conjugations in Arabic cannot, of course. be
exhibited here. In the vocabulary (pp. clxxvi et seq.) reference is made to
the above paradigms by the insertion of the letters (a), (b), (c), etc., after
the verbs there given. — It should be noted that the form kasm' does not
mean ‘to break“, but ‘he broke‘, or ‘he has broken’. The 3rd pers. sing.
(masc) of the perfect tense shows the simplest form of the verb (which
usually possesses three root-letters), so that that pers. of the perf. is given
in dictionaries “Mt-W"-
