shadows 011 each other. —— Considerable restorations are at present
in progress; in the N. half of the hall, where 11 columns fell on
Oct. 3rd, 1899, some of the columns have been temporarily
taken down.

The breadth (inside measurement) of this great hall is 338 ft.,
its depth 170 ft., and its area 5450 square yards, an area spacious

The roof is supported by 134 columns arranged in 16 rows, of

which the two central rows are higher than the others and consist
of clustered papyrus-columns with calyx-capitals, While the other
columns have bud—capitals.

The hall is divided into three aisles. The roof of the lofty cen—
tral aisle or nave is supported by the two central rows of columns
and one of the lower rows on each side, the deﬁciency in the height
of the latter being met by placing square pillars ab0ve them. The
spaces between these pillars were occupied by windows (one on
the S. side is still almost perfect), which served to light the entire
hall. The central aisle is about 78 ft. in height, the side-aisles
about 46 ft.
