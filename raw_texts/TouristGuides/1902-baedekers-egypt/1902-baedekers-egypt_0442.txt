317 M. TOURIST STEAMBOAT in 4 days.

The quay to the S. of the Ii’ag'rr en-Nil bridge is the starting-place
of the steamers. To the left (E. bank) lie the palaces and gardens
of Cairo, the British Consulate Genera], the island of Roda, and
Old Cairo (p. '70), beyond which rise the Mokattam Mts., with the
citadel, on the W. are the Palace of Gizeh, with the museum, and
the Pyramids of Gizeh. —— To the left (E. bank), farther on, are
the quarries an :1 hamlets of Turra and Ma'sara (see p. 155). Oppo-
site, on the W. bank, rise the pyramids of Abusir, Sakkara, and
Dahshﬁr. Farther up, to the left, amidst a ﬁne grove of palms, is a
Coptic convent, and adjacent is a still unﬁnished gun-factory.

The steamer remains for some hours at (14 M.) Bedrashén (rail.
stat, p. 189), where asses are kept ready for a visit to Memphis, Sak-
kara, etc. (p. 130). Opposite, on the right bank of the Nile, lies the
village of Helu'dn, and a little inland is the watering-place of that
name (p. 154). —-— 0n the bank at (31 M.) Kafr (l-‘Aydt (W. bank;
rail. stat.), where the three-weeks tourist-steamer lays to for the
night, are some ancient constructions. The unimportant pyramids
osz'sht lie to the right, that to the N. is the tomb of Amenemhet 1.
(12th Dyn.), that to the S. is the tomb of Usertesen l.

Rifclta (Reklcah), on the W. bank, is the starting—point of the ex-
cursion to the Pyramid and Mastabas of Meiddm (asses may be pro—
cured at the village; 2 fr. and bakshish).

The Prnamrn AND MnsraeAs 0F MEIDI‘IM deserve a visit, which may be
accomplished in about 6 hrs. (railway travellers may perform it in le=s
time from Rikka station; comp. p. 189). Crossing the railway, we proceed
on donkey-back in about 11/4 hr. to the pyramid, which rises close to the
cultivated country on the soil of the desert, 11/2 M. to the N. of the vil-
lage of Meidam. _

The Pyramid of Meidl’xm, in alltprobability the tomb of Snofru, the
predecessor of Kheops, is so different from all the other structures of
the kind that it is called by the Arabs el-[Iaram el-kadddb, or the false
pyramid. It consists of three (originally seven) square towers, which rise
to a height of 121 ft. in three smooth and steep stages at an angle of
74.0 10'. The ﬁrst section is 69 ft., and the second 20% ft., while the third,
now almost entirely destroyed, was once 32 ft. in height. The outer walls
consist of admirahly jointed and polished blocks of hlokattam stone. The
Pyramid of Meidﬁm was pillaged as early as in the time of the 20th Dyn-

asty. It was opzned in 1881 hy Maspero7 who found a longr corridor and
a chamber without sarcophagus. It was again carefully examined more
