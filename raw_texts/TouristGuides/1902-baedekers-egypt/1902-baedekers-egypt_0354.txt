The Third Pyramid, named by the Egyptians Nete-r-Menkewré
(‘Dz'm'ne is Menkewré’), was erected by Menkewré, the Mykermos of
Herodotus and the Mencheres of Manetho. Its present perpendicular
height (Pl. B B) is 204 ft., its former height (B 0) was 219 ft.; the
side of the base (A A) is 3561/2 ft.; the present height (ABA) of the
sloping sides is 2633/4 ft., being originally (A 0A) 2793/4 ft.; these
rise at an angle of 51°. The rock on which the Pyramid stands has
a shelving surface, and the necessary horizontal site was formed by
building up a pedestal of enormous blocks, instead of by removing
a portion of the rock. The stones of which the Pyramid is constructed
are remarkably large and well hewn. The upper part of its incrusta-
tion was of limestone blocks7 the lower part of granite, left partly
unpolished. The granite covering is in good preservation, especially
on the N. and W. sides. On the E. side are relics of the usual
temple of the dead.

The Interior is easily accessible. The entrance is on the N. side.. A
passage as descends at an angle of 26° 2' to a distance of 1041/2 it, being
lined with red granite where it passes through the masonry from a to b,
and then penetrating the solid rock from b to c. From c a horizontal pass-
age cd leads to an antechamber f, 7 ft. in height, 12 ft. in length, 10 ft.
in width, and decorated with door-shaped ornaments. Beyond this cham-
ber it passes three trap—doors g, descends slightly from h to d (gradient 4°),

a distance of 411/2 ft., and ﬁnally descends to the chamher e, in which
