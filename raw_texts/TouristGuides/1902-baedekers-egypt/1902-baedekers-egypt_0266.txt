54 Route 4. CAIRO. 3. South-Eastern

It lies in the quarter Kal‘at el—Kebsh, on a hill named Gebel Yeshkﬁr.
The ediﬁce is said to have been designed by a Christian prisoner
in imitation of the Ka‘ba at Mecca, but Without columns, and the
whole of the building was constructed of entirely new materials.
The walls consist of brick, coated with stucco. The older part of
the ornamentation,which is in carved stucco (not moulded) and wood,
exhibits none of the intricate forms of the Byzantine-Arabian style,
which appear in the later restorations.
