papyrus-columns with calyx—capitals, that above the side—aisles by
similar columns with bud-capitals. Beyond this columned hall lie
three small apartments side by side; the middle one of these, the
Sanctuary, was the dwelling proper of the god, while the side
chambers belonged to his wife [Mut] and to his son (Khons). Here
stood the sacred boats with the images of the gods. Sometimes the
