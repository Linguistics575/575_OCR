Quarters. CAIRO. 4. Route. 61

by the Emir Beshtak on the foundations of a palace of the Fatimite
Khalifs (entr. from the Derb Kirmez). — About 200 yds. farther
on, to the left, between the Turkish sebil of the Gami‘a es-Selahdar
and the lofty walls of a harem, is a narrow zigzag street leading to

the Mosque of Abu Bekr Mazhar el-Ansari (Pl. E, 2).

This mosque was built in 1497 by Abu Bekr, director of the chancery
of Sultan nan Bey, in the style of the small mosques of the later Mameluke
period, and has of late been thoroughly restored. It is full of the
characteristic decoration of its date. Especially noteworthy is the treat-
ment of the E. wall of the interior, where red and black plaster has been
pressed into the white marble background as a suhstitute for the more
costly marble mosaic.

Farther on the Shari‘a en-Nahhasin assumes the name Shdri’a
Bdb el-Fumh. On the left, about 50 paces farther on, we reach the
entrance of the ruinous — ’

Gami'a el-Ijiakim (Pl. E, 2), begun in 990, on the plan of the
Gami‘a Ibn Tulﬁn (p. 53), by Khalif el-‘Aziz, of the Fatimite
dynasty, and completed by his son El—Hakim in 1012. It was
seriously damaged by the earthquake of 1302, but was restored by
Bibars el-Gashankir. It now lies again in ruins, with the exception
of the sanctuary, which has been provided with a modern ceiling.
The two minarets are not unlike that of Ibn Tulﬁn.

A building on the S. side of the court, to the right of the en-
trance, now contains the *Arabia.n Museum (new building, see
p. 56), consisting of objects of artistic or antiquarian interest from
ruined mosques and secular buildings of Cairo, collected here by
the zeal of Franz Pasha, formerly technical director under the Wakf
ministry. The museum (tickets of admission, see p. 30) is open
daily, except Frid. and festivals, from 9 to 4. Students will ﬁnd
the illustrated catalogue (French 1895; English 1896) of service.

The director is Hem-Bey.
