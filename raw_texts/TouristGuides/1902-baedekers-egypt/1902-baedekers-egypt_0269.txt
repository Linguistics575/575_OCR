The GROUND FLOOR contains the Oriental MISS. A special feature of
the library, possessed by no other Oriental collection available to Franks,
consists of the Masdhif, or copies of the Koran, the ﬁnest of which a1e
exhibited in cases. They are remarkable for their large size, snperb
execution, and great age, and constitute the ﬁnest existing specimens of
Arabian art. The oldest specimens of the Koran, dating from the 3rd- 5th
cent of the Hegira (10- 12th cent of our era), are in the Cufic, or early
Arabian, character and are written on parchment — Most of the ﬁne large
copies of the Koran on apei were executed by order of the sultans of the
Bahrite Mamelukes (12563—1380) and of the Circassian Mamelukes (1382- 1517),
while a few of them date from the still later period of the Osman sultans.
Each example is furnished with a label giving its provenience and date.
One of the most interesting is the copy of Abd er-Razzdk, written by
‘Abd e1--Rahmdn 1'bn Abilfath' 1n the year 599 of the Hegira, and dedicated to
the mosque of Hosen. To the superscription of each sureh are added both
the number of verses and that of the words and letters it contains, besides
traditional ntterances of the Prophet connected with the chapter in ques-
tion, — a most laborious piece of work, resembling what has been done
by Jewish scholars in preparing copies of the Old Testament. Next in
interest is a. Koran of Sultan Mohammed e11-1Vd_51'1 17m Séfeddz‘n Kalaan
(1293-1341), written entirely in gilded characters, by Ahmed Yﬂsuf, a Turk
in 730 of the Hegira, Several other Korans date from the reign of Sultan
Sha'bdn (1363— 77), and fiom the time of Khondabmaka, his mother, they
are written on thick and strong paper, and vie with each other in magni-
ﬁc.ence — The collection contains three Korans of the reign of Sultan Barkﬂk
(1382- -99), the oldest of which, executed in 769 of the Hegira, measures 41 by
32 inches. It was written with one pen in sixty days by ‘Abd e1- -Rahmdn es-
Sdz'gh, the author of a pamphlet, entitled ‘Sami'al el-Kz'ldbeh’ (‘the art of
writing‘), and now preserved in this library. This skilful penman was
also employed by Farag (1399-1412), the son of Barkﬁk. From the year
810 dates a ﬁne copy, written by M12301 17m Ismaiz‘l el-Kindni, surnamed
00195111, for Sultan Shékh el-Mahmﬂdi Mum'yad (1412- 21). — A copy which
once belonged to Kdit Bey (1468- 96), dating from the year 909, is the
largest Koran' 1n the collection, measuring 443/4 by 351nches To the period
of the Osman sultans belongs the small mushaf of Safiya, mother of
Sultan Mohammed Khan, which dates from 988. In it a black line alter-
nates with a gilded one, and the ﬁrst few pages a1e very beautifully exe—
cuted. A copy ofljusen Bey Chemashm 911 is written in a smaller character.
— The library also boasts of many other valuable Korans from India Persia,
and Turkey One of the most beautiful of all was executed in Morocco.

The Fmsr LATERAL H'ALL contains a collection of Persian Miniatures.
The origin and development of this branch of art have not yet been ad-
equately investigated. The specimens here exhibited most of which were
collected by the late Mustafa Fadil Pasha, hrother of lsma‘i‘l Pasha, and
were afterwards purchased by the Egyptian government, have all been
produced under Mohammedan inﬂuences, though evidences of E. Asiatic
taste are abundant. These book-illustrations are distinguished from the
purely ornamental art of the Korans in the lower hall by a greater free-
dom of conception and variety of motive, particularly by the frequent em-
ployment of living forms. Nearly all are illustrations of poetical or his-
torical w01k.s The chronological arrangement shows that this art was at
its best in the 14-17th cent. , and that thereafter a rapid decline set in.
The ﬁnest miniatures are shown in the cases in the middle of the room.

Bustdn of Sa'di, written in the year 1498 and illustrated in 1515 by
the celebrated master Behzadeh of Herat, the title- -pages show E. Asiatic
inﬂuence — Khamsa (‘ﬁve looks) of the poet Nizdmz' (6th cent of the
Hegira): the earliest (folio) dates from 895 IL, with title- -pictures and ﬁne
binding, the second (folio; of 983) has full- -pa.ge illustrations and elegant
binding- , the third (large 8vo,1042), written for the Persian governor Kurtshi
Bashi, also has full- -page illustrations and ﬁne binding, the fourth dates
from 1102 of the Hei 1ra. — Thiee copies of the 01111211 of Hafiz of Shiraz
dating from 1654. — 0,11. Poems of Jami (d. 898 H. ), written in 978 (folio),
with numerous beautiful vignettes, also (8vo) the poem of Yusuf and Zu-
