ground, but it is now almost entirely sunk in the sand. It was
discovered and excavated by Mariette, and has been restored by the
‘Services des Antiquités de l’Egypte’, as is recorded on a tablet
at the entrance. The mural reliefs, besides being interesting on
account of their subjects, are among the ﬁnest and best-preserved
examples of the art of the Ancient Empire (comp. p. 01). The
imperfect lighting of the tomb unfortunately prevents some of the
reliefs from producing their full effect, and various delicate details
inevitably escape the visitor.

From the street(Pl.A) we ﬁrst enter the SMALL VESTIBULE (Pl. B),
which contains two pillars (upper parts restored), against which is

\\\\&\\ the E. wall are several female peasants
(Pl. a), representing the villages belong-
ing to Ti, bringing food to the tomb;
on the S. wall are poultry and doves
being fattened (P1. b). The other reliefs
are obliterated.

We next pass through a doorway,
the sides of which show ﬁgures of Ti
and inscriptions, and enter the GREAT
COURT (Pl. 0), an extensive quadrangle,
with a modern wooden roof borne by
twelve freely restored square pillars.
This hall was the scene of the offerings

a ﬂight of steps (Pl. (1), by which we

are represented the sacriﬁce of cattle, shown in the wood-cut

graphs taken from impressions obtained by Dr. Reil (d. 1880), and there-
fore almost facsimiles. With the exception of the large picture of Ti
engaged in hunting (p. 149), which is one-nineteenth the original size,
they are reduced to one-twelfth of the original size.
