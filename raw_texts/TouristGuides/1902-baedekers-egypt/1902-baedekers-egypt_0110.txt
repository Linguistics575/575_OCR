HISTORY.

career, however, was terminated by the intervention of
Russia and France. Syria was secured to Mohammed by
the peace of Kutdhyeh, but he was obliged to recognise the
suzerainty ofthe Porte. At the instigation of the British,
Sultan Mahmud renewed hostilities with Egypt, but he
was decisively defeated by Ibrahim at Nisibi on 24th June,
1839. In consequence of the armed intervention of Eng-
land and Austria, however, Ibrahim was compelled to
quit Syria entirely, and Mohammed was obliged to yield
to the Porte a second time. By the so-called ﬁrman of ill-
vestiture in 1841 Sultan Abdu'l—Medjid secured the hered-
itary sovereignty of Egypt to the family of Mohammed
rAli, the pasha renouncing his provinces of Syria, Candia,
and the Hijaz, and binding himself to pay an annual tri-
bute of 60,000 purses (about 306,0001.) to the Porte and
to reduce his army to 18,000 men. During the last years
of his life Mohammed fell into a state of imbecility. He
died on 2nd Aug., 1849, in his palace at Shubra.

Ibrahim, Mohammed rAli’s adopted son, had already taken
the reins of government, in consequence of Mohammed’s
incapacity, in Jan., 1848, but he died in November of
the same year, and before his adoptive father.

1be I., a son of rI‘ust‘1n(p.xcix),bad all the dislike of a true
son of the desert for European innovations. He, however,
maintained the strictest discipline among his ofﬁcials, and
the public security in Egypt was never greater than dur-
ing his reign. His death is attributed to assassination.

Sa‘id, his successor, was Mohammed ‘Ali’s fourth son. He
equalised the incidence of taxation, abolished monopolies,
improved the canals, completed the railways from Cairo
to Alexandria and to Suez, and, above all, zealously sup-
ported the scheme of M. Ferdinand de Lesseps for con-
structing a canal through the Isthmus of Suez, which was
opened in 1869 under his successor. During the Crimean
war he was obliged to send an auxiliary army and con-
siderable sums of money to the aid of the Porte. He died
on 18th Jan., 1863, and was succeeded by ~—

Isma'il, the second son of Ibrahim Pasha, who was born on
31st Dec., 1830. He had received the greater part of his
education in France and had there acquired the strong pre-
ference for European institutions which characterised him
throughout his reign. Most of his innovations, however,
such as the foundation of manufactories and the construc-
tion of canals , railways, bridges, and telegraphs, were
planned mainly in his own interest, though of course the
country shared in the advantage, while even in the es-
