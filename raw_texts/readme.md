## OCR Text Inventory
Each page of the following documents is contained in a separate text file in a directory named after the document.

(A few documents were scanned with an earlier version of the scanner that extracted 100 pages at a time, and are therefore transcribed 100 pages at a time.)

### Howard Carter Notes
Many of these pages either failed to scan legibly or didn't scan at all. While the image quality is good, many of the documents include hand-annotations, illustrations, and hieroglyphs that no modern OCR software will be able to handle. The following entries show some text, though usually unintelligible.
* Carter-i-c-145
* Carter-i-c-146
* Carter-i-c-147
* Carter-i-c-148
* Carter-i-c-150
* Carter-i-c-152
* Carter-i-c-153
* Carter-i-c-154
* Carter-i-c-158
* Carter-i-c-159
* Carter-i-c-160-162
* Carter-i-c-163
* Carter-i-c-164
* Carter-i-c-165
* Carter-i-c-166
* Carter-i-c-167

This last entry is the one exception, scanning rather well. It is probably useful, being an inventory of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection of the Valley of the Kings as of June, 1915 
* Carter-i-j-389

### Egyptian Gazette
There are only three pages scanned so far. Someone with FineReader who can expand the templates to include other pages might be able to make progress on either our repository or Wil Hanley's collection.
